properly complied with, the award made in the inquiry shall not be
questioned in any appeal before the Board or in any court on the
ground —

to which it relates in accordance with section 10(1)(a).

thereon, confirm, reduce, increase or annul any award determined by
the Board in the appeal, or may remit the case to the Board with the
opinion of the Court of Appeal thereon. Where a case is so remitted
by the Court of Appeal, the Board is bound by the opinion of the
Court of Appeal and must give effect thereto by its decision in the
appeal or (as the case may be) by revising any previous decision made

increased, the increase is to be set off only against the amount of
compensation
that
would
otherwise
be
payable
under

written law and accepted by him or her at that value for the
purposes of assessing the tax or duty payable thereon

(1A) If —
(a) an award is made under section 10 with respect to a non-lot
acquisition relating to a strata title plan; and

proprietors constituting the management corporation for
the strata title plan serve on the Collector a copy of a
special resolution mentioned in section 85A(4) of the
Building Maintenance and Strata Management Act 2004
with respect to that non-lot acquisition,
the Collector need not make a written offer of the compensation
awarded in accordance with subsection (1) but must instead —
(c) inform the management corporation for the strata title plan
that the compensation awarded is to be paid to the persons
in section 10(1B)(a); and
(d) pay that compensation according to section 10(1B) unless

in subsection (2).
[26/2014]
(2) If they do not consent to receive it, or if there is no person
competent to alienate the land, or if there is any dispute as to the title
to receive the compensation or as to the apportionment of it, or if
possession of the land has not been taken by the Collector, the
Collector must apply to the Registrar of the Supreme Court by way of
an application without notice for an order to deposit the amount of the
compensation in court, and, despite anything to the contrary in the

such an order except that any person admitted to be interested may
receive such payment under protest as to the sufficiency of the
amount.

parties concerned.
Payment of interest
41. When the amount of such compensation is not paid or deposited
on or before taking possession of the land, the Collector must pay the

temporary occupation and use of that land, for such term or terms as
may be determined, ordinarily not exceeding a total of 3 continuous
years from the start of the occupation.
[12/2015]
(2) Upon the direction of the President under subsection (1) to
procure the temporary occupation and use of any land that is not State

right to enter upon and take temporary possession of that land in
accordance with the terms of that direction.
[12/2015]

each term determined under subsection (1) that land is to be entered
upon and taken temporary possession of in accordance with a
direction under subsection (1).

(4) The Board may extend any period specified in subsection (3)
within which a claim must be served upon the Collector if an
application for the extension is made to the Board, either before or

the severing of the land to be acquired from the person’s other land, or
if, even though no such claim has been made, a Collector holding
such an inquiry has certified under his or her hand that compensation
as aforesaid is payable upon the acquisition, it is lawful for the
President at any time before the Collector has made his or her award,
to order the acquisition of the whole or any additional portion of the
land of which the land first sought to be acquired forms a part.
(2) No fresh notification or other proceedings under sections 5, 6
and 8 are necessary; but the Collector must without delay furnish a
