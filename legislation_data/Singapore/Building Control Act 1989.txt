instead of lodging the plans of those works with the Commissioner of
Building Control under this section.
(7) The building regulations may —
(a) prescribe as lodgment works any class of building works
that have been assessed as suitable to be so prescribed
because they are less complex building works; and

lodgment works (including any amended plans), including
but not limited to —
(i) the lodgment fee, if any;

under section 5 for approval of the plans of the proposed
departure or deviation; or

(i) comply with the conditions in section 5AA(2) in
relation to the amended plans, and section 5AA
applies accordingly in relation to such plans; or

proposed departure or deviation.

any lodgment works ends and is superseded to the extent that the
