Section 3: repealed, on 22 December 1933, by section 3(2) of the Land Transfer (Hawke’s Bay)
Amendment Act 1933 (1933 No 39).
Provisions applicable where outstanding duplicates of instruments extant
4
Provisions applicable in cases where outstanding duplicates have not been
destroyed
(1)
The provisions of this section shall apply only in cases where certificates of
title or other instruments that were registered in the old register or duplicates of
instruments that were embodied in the old register have not been destroyed.
(2)
In any case to which this section applies, the Registrar may cause copies of
such instruments or duplicates as aforesaid to be prepared. Such copies shall,
upon being duly authenticated under the hand and seal of the Registrar, and
subject to the provisions of this Act, have the same force and effect as the cor-
responding folios of the old register, or the corresponding original instruments,
as the case may be.
(3)
In the case of certificates of title, the Registrar, in lieu of making and authenti-
cating copies as provided for in the last preceding subsection, may issue new
certificates of title which shall, subject to the provisions of this Act, have the
same force and effect as if they were certificates of title issued under the provi-
sions of the principal Act. Every such certificate shall have endorsed thereon a
memorandum to the effect that it is issued in lieu of a certificate of title the
register copy of which has been destroyed.
(4)
In any case where an instrument was executed in triplicate, and whether or not
a triplicate was presented for registration, if 2 copies of such instrument have
been destroyed, the provisions of subsection (2) shall apply with respect to the
remaining triplicate if the Registrar is satisfied that the same is a true triplicate
of such instrument. Unless and until the Registrar endorses thereon a memoran-
dum to the effect that it is conclusive, no such remaining triplicate or duplicate
copy adopted in accordance with the next succeeding subsection shall be con-
clusive as to any memorials that may have been endorsed upon the triplicate
that was retained by the Registrar, and the Registrar shall endorse upon it a
memorandum that it is not conclusive as to such memorials (if any). Subject to
the foregoing provisions of this subsection, every such remaining triplicate or
adopted duplicate shall for the purposes of this section be regarded as if it were
the registered triplicate upon which memorials were or may have been
endorsed by the Registrar.

(5)
On the adoption of any triplicate of any registered instrument it shall be lawful
for the Registrar to receive with the adopted triplicate 2 copies thereof, and to
certify one of such copies free of cost, and to issue the same in substitution for
the outstanding duplicate of the instrument upon which memorials are to be
endorsed under section 40 of the principal Act, and thereafter such copy shall
have the same force and effect as if it were the original duplicate upon which
memorials may be endorsed by the Registrar.

Amendment Act 1933 (1933 No 39).

Evidential value of certificates and other instruments issued or
authenticated under last preceding section
(1)
Except as provided in subsection (3), no certificate of title issued under the last
preceding section, or issued in substitution for any such certificate of title, or
issued in respect of any part of the land comprised in any such certificate of
title, and no copy of any instrument authenticated under that section, shall,
until the expiration of 1 year from the date of the issue of such certificate of
title, or from the date of the issue of the first such certificate where more than 1
certificate of title has been issued, or from the date of the Registrar’s authenti-
cation of such copy, as the case may be, or until the expiration of 1 year from
the date of the passing of this Act, whichever period is the later to expire, be
conclusive as to the proprietorship of any mortgage, lease, easement, or profit à
prendre, or as to the non-existence on 3 February 1931 of—
(a)
any charge created otherwise than by a registered mortgage (not includ-
ing a sub-mortgage); or
(b)
any registered lien; or
(c)
any caveat lodged to protect any estate or interest; or
(d)
any Proclamation taking the land or any part of it; or
(e)
any restriction or other matter in respect of which any memorial may
have been registered in the old register; or
(f)
any encumbrance upon or other dealing with any mortgage, lease, ease-
ment, or profit à prendre registered on or before the said date.
(2)
Any person claiming the benefit of any such charge, lien, estate or interest,
encumbrance, or other dealing as is referred to in the last preceding subsection
may re-register such charge or lien in the manner provided for the registration
of the same in the old register, or may lodge a caveat or a new caveat to protect
such charge, lien, estate or interest, or encumbrance, or other dealing. Upon the
expiration of the time limited by the said subsection every such charge or lien
in respect of which a memorial has not been entered on the new register by the

Registrar, or that has not been re-registered, or in respect of which a caveat has
not been lodged, and every caveat lodged to protect an interest in respect of
which a new caveat has not been lodged, shall, as against any person who
within the time limited as aforesaid or at any time thereafter becomes a regis-
tered proprietor bona fide and for value, be deemed never to have been regis-
tered or lodged, as the case may be.
(3)
If the Registrar is satisfied, upon such evidence as may seem to him to be suffi-
cient, that the land comprised in any certificate of title or dealt with by any
other instrument referred to in the last preceding section was not on the said
date subject to any such charge, lien, estate or interest, encumbrance, or other
dealing as is mentioned in subsection (1), the Registrar may endorse upon the
copy prepared and authenticated, or upon the new certificate of title issued, as
respectively provided for in the last preceding section, a memorandum to the
effect that it is conclusive as to such matters, or as to any 1 or more of them,
and it shall thereupon be conclusive accordingly.
Section 5(1)(c): replaced, on 22 December 1933, by section 9 of the Land Transfer (Hawke’s Bay)
Amendment Act 1933 (1933 No 39).
Section 5(2): amended, on 22 December 1933, by section 10 of the Land Transfer (Hawke’s Bay)

Provisions applicable where registered instruments and outstanding duplicates
destroyed
6
Where outstanding copy of certificate of title destroyed new certificate
may be issued on application of registered proprietor or mortgagee
(1)
Any person claiming to have been on the said date the registered proprietor, or
a mortgagee under a registered mortgage, of an estate of freehold, evidenced by
any certificate of title, in any land, if he knows or believes that such certificate
of title was destroyed, may make application to the Registrar, in the form in the
Schedule or in such other form as may be prescribed, for the issue of a new
certificate of title for such land. Such application shall have endorsed thereon
or shall be accompanied by a plan of the land of which the applicant claims to
have been the registered proprietor or mortgagee, and shall include a statement
of the registered encumbrances, liens, and interests, statutory and other
charges, restrictions, and caveats to which, within the knowledge or belief of
the applicant, the land was subject; and the statements contained in such appli-
cation shall be verified by the statutory declaration of the applicant. The plan
shall be as full and accurate as the circumstances of each case will permit with-
out the making of a new survey of the land.
(2)
The Registrar, if he is satisfied, after the making of such inquiries and the send-
ing of such notices, if any, as he may deem necessary or advisable, that the cer-
tificate of title was destroyed, and that the applicant was the registered proprie-
tor or a mortgagee as aforesaid, may issue a new certificate of title for the land
the subject of the application.

Memorandum of interests admitted by proprietor or mortgagee
(1)
The Registrar shall endorse on every such new certificate of title a memoran-
dum setting forth the encumbrances, liens, and interests, statutory and other
charges, restrictions, and caveats to which the land appears to him to be sub-
ject.
(2)
In any case in which it seems to him proper so to do, the Registrar may at any
time cancel any such memorandum, or he may add to or amend the statements
contained in any such memorandum, by a further memorandum:
provided that in any case where by any such addition or amendment it is shown
that any interest in the land is subject to any further encumbrance, lien, interest,
charge, restriction, or caveat, the Registrar shall forthwith send by registered
letter to every registered proprietor adversely affected by such addition or
amendment a notice that such addition or amendment has been made.
(3)
Every such memorandum shall be prima facie proof of the existence of the
estates or interests or of the matters referred to in it.
8
Where outstanding copy of certificate of title destroyed Registrar may
issue new one
The Registrar, in any case where he knows or believes that the certificate of
title for any land was destroyed, may, if it seems to him proper so to do, of his
own motion or at the instance of any person claiming an estate or interest in the
land, issue a new certificate of title for such land. The provisions of the last
preceding section shall, with the necessary modifications, apply to every such
certificate of title.

(1)
Except as provided in the next succeeding subsection, or in section 11 or sec-
tion 12, an interim certificate of title shall not be conclusive.
(2)
The Registrar may at any time, on such evidence as seems to him to be suffi-
cient, endorse upon an interim certificate of title a memorandum to the effect
that it is conclusive as to all estates and interests evidenced thereby, or that it is
conclusive as to any 1 or more of such estates and interests, or that it is conclu-
sive as to the description and delineation of the land comprised therein, and the
said certificate of title shall thereupon be conclusive according to the tenor of
such memorandum.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3)
Any certificate of title issued in substitution for an interim certificate of title or
issued for any part of the land comprised in an interim certificate shall be an
interim certificate, with respect to which the provisions of the last preceding
subsection shall apply.
11
Application to make interim certificate conclusive
(1)
The registered proprietor, or a mortgagee, of land comprised in an interim cer-
tificate of title may at any time make application in writing to the Registrar, to
endorse upon such certificate a memorandum that it is conclusive. Such appli-
cation shall be accompanied by such evidence as may be necessary to establish,
without reasonable doubt, the ownership of the land comprised in the certifi-
cate of title, and the encumbrances, liens, interests, charges, and restrictions (if
any) to which the land is subject.
(2)
Upon receipt of any such application the Registrar shall consider the evidence
submitted in support thereof, and may require the production of further evi-
dence in support thereof.
(3)
If the Registrar is satisfied with any such evidence or further evidence, he shall
endorse upon the interim certificate of title a memorandum as provided for by
the last preceding section.
(4)
If the Registrar is not satisfied with such evidence or further evidence, he may,
at the expense of the applicant, publish notice of the application once in the
Gazette and twice at an interval of not less than 2 weeks in some newspaper or
newspapers published and circulating in the district. Such notice shall limit and
appoint a time, not less than the prescribed period, within which any person
claiming to have been the registered proprietor of, or claiming to be entitled to
the benefit of any encumbrance, lien, or interest upon or in, the land may
present for registration an appropriate instrument, in the same manner as if the
old register had not been destroyed, for the purpose of re-evidencing such
encumbrance, lien, or interest, or may lodge a caveat in the form required by
section 137 of the principal Act to protect the same, whether such encum-
brance, lien, or interest was registered in the old register or not.
(5)
After the expiration of the time limited in any such notice, the Registrar shall,
unless in his opinion there is good and sufficient reason to the contrary, endorse
upon the interim certificate of title for the land referred to in such notice a
memorandum to the effect that it is conclusive, or that it is conclusive except as
to the description and delineation of the land comprised therein, as to him shall
seem proper in the circumstances, and the certificate of title shall thereupon be
conclusive according to the tenor of such memorandum; but subject, neverthe-
less, to the rights, if any, of any person who shall theretofore have lodged a
caveat.
(6)
The Registrar may at any time thereafter, if he is reasonably satisfied that the
interim certificate correctly sets forth the description and delineation of the
land comprised therein, endorse a further memorandum to the effect that such
s 11

certificate of title is conclusive as to the description and delineation of the land,
and the certificate shall thereupon be conclusive according to the tenor of such
memorandum.

Interim certificates of title to become conclusive after 6 years
Every interim certificate shall, after the expiration of 6 years from the date of
its issue, be conclusive as to all matters except the description and delineation
of the land comprised therein, whether or not the Registrar has endorsed
thereon a memorandum to that effect. For the purposes of this section, in cases
when an interim certificate has been issued in substitution for an interim certifi-
cate or in respect of part of the land comprised in a former interim certificate,
the period of 6 years aforesaid shall begin to run on the date of the issue of the
original interim certificate.
Leasehold interests in Crown lands or other lands administered by the Hawke’s
Bay Land Board
13
Where outstanding copy of lease or licence lost or destroyed
(1)
Where, with respect to Crown land or other land administered by the Commis-
sioner of Crown Lands (appointed under section 12A(1) of the Survey Act
1986), a lease or licence a duplicate of which was embodied in the old register
as a folium has been cancelled, the Commissioner shall, on application by the
lessee or licensee or by a mortgagee, prepare and execute and shall present for
registration a new lease or licence of the land for the unexpired residue of the
term, and subject to the terms and conditions, as nearly as they can be ascer-
tained, of the destroyed lease or licence. The Registrar shall thereupon register
such new lease or licence in the new register in the manner in which the
destroyed lease or licence was registered. Every lease or licence issued under
this section shall have endorsed thereon a memorandum to the effect that it is
an interim lease or licence.
(2)
The provisions of sections 7, 9, 10, 11, and 12 shall apply, with the necessary
modifications, to every interim lease or licence issued under this section in the
same manner as they apply to interim certificates of title.

estate of freehold in respect of which a certificate of title existed on the said
date, or other than a leasehold interest under a lease or licence embodied in the
old register as a folium thereof, and knowing or believing that the instrument
under which he claims has been destroyed may, without payment of any fee,
lodge a caveat in the form required by section 137 of the principal Act to pro-
tect such estate or interest, charge, or lien. Every such caveat shall operate to
preserve for all purposes the priority of the estate or interest, charge, or lien to
protect which such caveat was lodged:
provided that where pursuant to this section a caveat affecting the land com-
prised in any certificate of title or in any lease or licence is lodged at any time
after an interim certificate of title or an interim lease or licence comprising
such land has been made or has become conclusive, in accordance with the
foregoing provisions of this Act, such caveat shall not operate to affect any
estate or interest in such land that may have been acquired for valuable consid-
eration, without notice of the estate or interest, charge, or lien of the caveator:
provided also that in the case of the land comprised in any certificate of title or
other instrument to which section 5 applies, a caveat lodged in accordance with
this section shall not affect the estate or interest of a registered proprietor
whose right or interest is protected by subsection (2) of that section.
(2)
Upon the registration of an instrument for the purpose of evidencing any such
estate or interest, charge, or lien, such caveat shall be deemed to have lapsed.
(3)
No such caveat shall prevent the registration of any instrument in which, or by
endorsement on which, the rights of the caveator are admitted. The consent of
the caveator to the registration of any such instrument shall not be necessary.
Section 14(1): amended, on 17 May 2005, by section 18 of the Land Transfer Amendment Act 2005
(2005 No 58).
Section 14(1) first proviso: amended, on 22 December 1933, by section 11(a) of the Land Transfer

15
Registered proprietor bound to execute new instruments where originals
destroyed
(1)
Every proprietor whose estate or interest is subject to an encumbrance, lien, or
interest acquired under or by virtue of an instrument that was destroyed, upon
being requested so to do by the person who was on the said date the proprietor
of such encumbrance, lien, or interest, or by the successor in title of such per-
son, shall be bound, in the same manner as if he had contracted so to do, but
without cost to himself, to execute an appropriate instrument having as nearly
as possible the same effect, after registration, as the destroyed instrument had.
(2)
No instrument so executed by any such person shall, unless therein expressed
or necessarily implied to the contrary as regards the person executing the same,
have any greater effect as against any person or any estate or interest than the
s 15
Land Transfer (Hawke’s Bay) Act 1931

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
destroyed instrument had, and no such instrument shall, unless therein
expressed or necessarily implied to the contrary, operate so as to relieve any
person, other than any party to it, from the obligation to perform any covenant
that may have been expressed or implied in any destroyed instrument.
(3)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the principal Act, every new
instrument executed and registered to replace a destroyed instrument shall have
the same priority over any other instrument as the destroyed instrument had,
notwithstanding that such new instrument may be registered subsequently to
the registration of such other instrument. Where a new instrument has such pri-
ority the Registrar shall add to the memorial of such new instrument a memo-
randum indicating the priority.
Maori freehold land
Heading: amended, on 27 November 1947, pursuant to section 2 of the Maori Purposes Act 1947
(1947 No 59).
16
Partition orders of Maori freehold land
(1)
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Native Land Act 1909, or in
any other Act, the Registrar shall not be bound to register any partition order
affecting any Maori freehold land or any other land that is or was subject to the
jurisdiction of the Native Land Court, or to register any other order having the
effect of vesting in any person an estate of freehold in any such land, unless
and until he is reasonably satisfied either—
(a)
that on the said date there was no interest of any kind and no caveat
registered in the old register or under the Deeds Registration Act 1908,
as the case may be, affecting the land comprised in such partition order
or other order; or
(b)
that every such interest or caveat has been re-registered or otherwise
protected in accordance with the provisions of this Act.
(2)
For the purposes of this section the expression Maori freehold land has the
same meaning as in the Native Land Act 1909.

Act 1947 (1947 No 59).

which had been registered, neglects to furnish such particulars of his easement,
or profit à prendre, or other encumbrance, as the Registrar may require by

the Registrar may, at his discretion, at any time after the expiration of the pre-
scribed period, remove any entry of such easement, profit à prendre, or other
encumbrance from the register, or from any certificate of title, or other out-
standing duplicate of the register, by marking the memorial thereof in the regis-
ter with the words “Removed.—See K No . . . ([date]) . . . Registrar”, and a

profit à prendre, or encumbrance shall cease and determine.
