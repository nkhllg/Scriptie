Mining Registrar to investigate title to licences
(1)
As soon as conveniently may be after the commencement of this Act, every
Mining Registrar shall make such inquiry as shall be necessary for the purpose
of ascertaining, with respect to every licence registered at the commencement
of this Act in any register kept by him under the Mining Act 1926, whether or
not at the time of the inquiry, in his opinion,—
(a)
the licence is current:
(b)
the licence is liable to forfeiture under paragraph (e) of section 190 of
the Mining Act 1926 or has been abandoned within the meaning of para-
graph (e) of section 194 of that Act:
(c)
any person, other than the registered licensee or a tenant of the registered
licensee or a person occupying the same with the consent of the regis-
tered licensee, is in occupation of the land comprised in the licence or of
any part of that land.
(2)
Where on any such inquiry the Registrar is satisfied with respect to any licence
that at the time of the inquiry—
(a)
it is current; and
(b)
it is not liable to forfeiture and has not been abandoned as aforesaid; and
s 3

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c)
no person, other than the registered licensee or a tenant of the registered
licensee or a person occupying the same with the consent of the regis-
tered licensee, is in occupation of the land comprised in the licence or of
any part of that land,—
then, subject to the provisions of section 5, the Registrar shall issue in respect
of the licence a certificate in the form in Schedule 1.
(3)
Where on any such inquiry the Mining Registrar is satisfied that the licence is
current at the time of the inquiry but is liable to forfeiture or has been aban-
doned as aforesaid and that no person, other than the registered licensee or a
tenant of the registered licensee or a person occupying the same with the con-
sent of the registered licensee, is in occupation of the land comprised in the
licence or of any part of that land, the Registrar shall apply to the Warden
under the Mining Act 1926 for a decree of forfeiture or a certificate of aban-
donment, as the case may be, in respect of the licence. Where the Warden refu-
ses to grant such a decree or certificate, then, subject to the provisions of sec-
tion 5, the Mining Registrar shall issue in respect of the licence a certificate in
the form in Schedule 1.
(4)
Where under subsection (3) the Warden grants a decree of forfeiture or a certif-
icate of abandonment with respect to any licence, the Mining Registrar shall
give notice in writing thereof to the Commissioner of Crown Lands.
4
Land occupied by person other than registered licensee
(1)
Where on any inquiry under section 3 the Mining Registrar is satisfied with
respect to any licence that at the time of the inquiry—
(a)
it is current; and
(b)
it is not liable to forfeiture under paragraph (e) of section 190 of the
Mining Act 1926 and has not been abandoned within the meaning of
paragraph (e) of section 194 of that Act; and
(c)
some person, other than the registered licensee or a tenant of the regis-
tered licensee or a person occupying the same with the consent of the
registered licensee, is in occupation of the land comprised in the licence
or of any part of that land,—
he shall forthwith apply to the Warden to make such order with respect to the
licence as the Warden thinks necessary in the circumstances of the case,
either—
(d)
confirming the title of the registered licensee to the licence; or
(e)
cancelling the licence and granting to the licensee a new licence of the
same kind as the existing licence of part of the land comprised in the
existing licence; or
(f)
cancelling the licence and granting to any person occupying the land
comprised in the existing licence or any part of that land a new licence
Reprinted as at

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
of the same kind as the existing licence of the whole or such part as the
Warden thinks fit of the land comprised in the existing licence; or
(g)
cancelling the licence.
(2)
On any application under subsection (1), the Warden may make any order spe-
cified in paragraphs (d) to (g) of that subsection or such other order as he con-
siders just and equitable in the circumstances of the case.
(3)
Any new licence granted under the provisions of subsection (2) shall be for the
unexpired term of the cancelled licence, at the rent payable under the cancelled
licence at the date of the cancellation, and otherwise upon the conditions of the
cancelled licence:
provided that the term of every renewal to which the licensee is entitled under
the new licence shall be the same as the term of every renewal to which the
licensee under the cancelled licence was entitled.
(4)
A new licence may be granted under the provisions of subsection (2), notwith-
standing anything in section 6 of the Mining Amendment Act 1953 or in sec-
tion 2 of the Mining Amendment Act 1961.
(5)
Notice of an application to the Warden under this section shall—
(a)
in the case of a licence of unalienated Crown land (not being Maori
ceded land), be served by the Mining Registrar on the Commissioner of
Crown Lands, on the person in occupation of the land or of any part
thereof, and also on such other persons and in such manner as the War-
den directs:
(b)
in the case of a licence of other land, be served by the Mining Registrar
on the person in occupation of the land or of any part thereof and also on
such other persons and in such manner as the Warden directs.
(6)
Without limiting the powers of the Warden to make any order under subsection
(2), the Warden may under that subsection grant a new licence to any person
occupying the whole or part of the land comprised in an existing licence, if he
is satisfied that—
(a)
the occupier would, if the land were freehold land subject to the Land
Transfer Act 2017, be entitled if application were made under the Trusts
Act 2019 to an order vesting in him the whole or part of the land; or
(b)
the occupier had been in possession of the land comprised in the licence,
or part of that land, as the case may be, for a period of not less than 12
years and that his possession had been adverse to the title of the regis-
tered licensee; or
(c)
it is just and equitable on any ground whatsoever that a licence be gran-
ted to the occupier of the whole or part of the land.
(7)
On any application to the Warden under subsection (1), the Warden may
receive as evidence any statement, document, information, or matter that may

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in his opinion assist him to deal effectually with the application, whether or not
the same would be otherwise admissible in a court of law.
(8)
On any application to the Warden under subsection (1), the Warden may make
such inquiries, interview such persons, and take such other steps as he con-
siders necessary or expedient for the purpose of resolving by the agreement of
all the persons concerned any question arising in the proceedings.
(9)
Where a licence in respect of which an application is made to the Warden
under subsection (1) confers on the licensee a right of renewal and the licence
expires before the making of an order under subsection (2), the licence shall be
deemed to continue in force until the expiration of the time for appealing
against the decision of the Warden or, in the event of an appeal against that
decision, until the appeal has been determined. Where as a result of the deci-
sion of the Warden or, as the case may be, the decision on appeal a new licence
is to be granted, that licence shall be for the same term as the renewal term pro-
vided in the expired licence and at the same rent and otherwise on the same
conditions as the expired licence.
(10)
The provisions of this Act shall apply with respect to every licence granted
under this section as if it were registered at the commencement of this Act, and,
subject to the provisions of section 5, the Mining Registrar shall, without fur-
ther inquiry, issue in respect of the licence a certificate in the form in Schedule
1.
(11)
Notwithstanding anything in the Mining Act 1926, the consent of the Minister
of Energy shall not be required to the grant of any licence under this section.
(12)
Where a new licence is issued under this section to the licensee under a former
licence or to an equitable owner of a former licence, the licence (whether it is
in respect of the whole or part of the land in the former licence) shall be
deemed to be subject to all registered encumbrances, liens, and other interests
to which the former licence was subject at the date of the granting of the new
licence, and for the unexpired term of the former licence shall be entitled to the
benefit of all interests to which the former licence was entitled at that date, and
all such encumbrances, liens, and other interests shall be preserved in the order
of their existing priority.
(13)
Where a new licence is issued under this section to a person other than the
licensee under a former licence or an equitable owner of a former licence, the
new licence (whether it is in respect of the whole or part of the land in the for-
mer licence) shall be subject to such (if any) of the registered encumbrances,
liens, and interests to which the former licence was subject at the date of the
granting of the new licence as are specified in the order granting the new
licence, and for the unexpired term of the former licence shall be entitled to the
benefit of all interests to which the former licence was entitled at that date, and
all such encumbrances, liens, and other interests shall be preserved in the order
of their existing priority.

Description of land and diagrams
(1)
Before the Mining Registrar issues a certificate in the form in Schedule 1 with
respect to any licence, the Chief Surveyor of the land district in which the land
comprised in the licence is situated shall make such investigations as he thinks
necessary for the purpose of determining whether or not in his opinion the
description of the land comprised in the licence and any diagram of the land
endorsed on or attached to the original licence or duplicate original licence or
certified copy licence, as the case may be, registered in the office of the Mining
Registrar are reasonably sufficient to identify the land.
(2)
Where the Chief Surveyor is satisfied that the description and diagram as afore-
said are reasonably sufficient to identify the land, he shall endorse on or attach
to the original licence or duplicate original licence or certified copy licence, as
the case may be, registered in the office of the Mining Registrar, so as to be
identifiable therewith, a certificate to that effect.
(3)
Where the Chief Surveyor is not so satisfied, he shall prepare and endorse on
or attach to the original licence or duplicate original licence or certified copy
licence, as the case may be, registered in the office of the Mining Registrar a
description of the land or a diagram thereof, or both, reasonably sufficient in
his opinion to identify the land, together with a certificate that the description
and diagram are reasonably sufficient to identify the land.
(4)
For the purposes of this section, the Chief Surveyor may, by notice in writing
served on the licensee, call upon him to produce for inspection by the Chief
Surveyor any plan, search notes, or other document in his possession or under
his control evidencing or tending to evidence in any manner the description,
boundaries, extent, or position of the land comprised in the licence.
(5)
Subject to the provisions of sections 10 and 22, the description and diagram of
the land comprised in any licence as certified by the Chief Surveyor under this
section shall for the purposes of this Act and the Land Transfer Act 2017 be
deemed to be the correct description of the land for which the licence was gran-
ted.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a)
the original licence is not filed in the office of the Mining Registrar and
no duplicate original or certified copy of the licence is filed in that
office; or
(b)
the original of any instrument referred to in paragraph (c) of subsection
(1) of section 9 is not filed in the office of the Mining Registrar and no
duplicate original or certified copy of the instrument is filed in that
office; or
(c)
no sketch plan or diagram reasonably sufficient to identify the land is
held in the office of the Mining Registrar,—
the Mining Registrar may require any person having in his possession or under
his control the original licence or instrument, as the case may be, or any dupli-
cate original or certified copy of the licence or instrument, or any written or
printed document evidencing or tending to evidence in any manner the licence
or instrument, or any sketch plan or diagram or other document evidencing or
tending to evidence in any manner the boundaries or extent or position of the
land, to produce the same within a reasonable time to be fixed by a notice
requiring that production and indicating the particular documents or kind of
documents or plans or diagrams required, and to deposit the same in the office
of the Mining Registrar for such time as may be necessary to enable the Mining
Registrar to make copies thereof.
(2)
The Mining Registrar may make a copy of any such document or plan or dia-
gram and certify it as being a true copy thereof.
(3)
The Mining Registrar may require any person of any of the classes hereinafter
mentioned to give any information, explanation, or evidence, in writing upon
oath or otherwise, concerning the licence or instrument, or to attend at the time
specified in the notice at the office of the Mining Registrar nearest to the place
where that person resides, and give to the Mining Registrar that information,
explanation, or evidence orally upon oath or otherwise. The classes of persons
referred to in this subsection are the following:
(a)
any person appearing from the register kept in the office of the Mining
Registrar to be the owner of, or of any estate or interest in, the licence or
claiming to be the owner of the licence or of any estate or interest
therein:
(b)
any person being the solicitor or agent of, and acting on behalf of, any of
the aforesaid persons.
(4)

mentioned in the foregoing provisions of this section any person without
reasonable cause refuses or neglects to comply with the requisition, he commits
an offence, and is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $10 for every
day during which the refusal or neglect has continued.

Provisions as to lost or destroyed licences
(1)
Where on making an inquiry under section 3 with respect to any licence the
Mining Registrar is satisfied that—
(a)
the licence is current; and
(b)
the original of the licence is not filed in the office of the Mining
Registrar and no duplicate original or certified copy of the licence is
filed in that office; and
(c)
the Mining Registrar is satisfied that by reason of the loss or destruction
of the original licence and of all duplicate originals and certified copies
of the licence a duplicate thereof cannot be issued under the provisions
of subsection (2) of section 433 of the Mining Act 1926,—
the Mining Registrar shall serve notice on the person appearing to him to be the
licensee requiring him within 3 months after service on him of the notice to
apply to the Warden for the grant of a licence of the land comprised in the ori-
ginal licence, and advising him that if he fails to do so the licence will be can-
celled at the expiration of that period.
(2)
Notwithstanding anything in section 6 of the Mining Amendment Act 1953 or
in section 2 of the Mining Amendment Act 1961, the Warden, on the applica-
tion of the person appearing to him to be the licensee, made within 3 months
after service on that person of the notice referred to in subsection (1), or within
such further period as the Warden in any special case may allow, may grant to
that person a new licence of the land comprised in the original licence for the
unexpired term of the original licence, at the rent payable under the original
licence at the date of the application, and otherwise upon the conditions of the
original licence:
provided that the term of every renewal to which the licensee is entitled under
the new licence shall be the same as the term of every renewal to which the
licensee under the original licence was entitled.
(3)
Subject to the provisions of subsection (2), if no such application is made
within the said period of 3 months, the licence shall be deemed to be cancelled
at the expiration of that period, and the Mining Registrar shall make an entry in
his register that the licence has been cancelled under this subsection:
provided that, if under subsection (2) the Warden extends the time within
which an application may be made under that subsection, the licence shall
thereupon be deemed to be revived.
(4)
If on any such application the Warden refuses to grant a new licence, the ori-
ginal licence shall thereupon be deemed to be cancelled. The Registrar of the
Warden’s Court shall notify the Mining Registrar of the refusal of the Warden
to grant a new licence, and the Mining Registrar shall make an entry in his
register that the licence has been cancelled under this subsection.

Where a licence in respect of which an application is made to the Warden
under subsection (2) confers on the licensee a right of renewal and the licence
expires before the making of an order under that subsection, the licence shall
be deemed to continue in force until the expiration of the time for appealing
against the decision of the Warden or, in the event of an appeal against that
decision, until the appeal has been determined. Where as a result of the deci-
sion of the Warden or, as the case may be, the decision on appeal a new licence
is to be granted to the applicant, that licence shall be for the same term as the
renewal term provided in the expired licence and at the same rent and other-
wise on the same conditions as the expired licence.

interests to which the former licence was entitled at that date, and all such

Any person aggrieved by a decision of the Warden under section 4 or section 7
may appeal against that decision to the High Court. The provisions of the Min-
ing Act 1926, as far as they are applicable and with the necessary modifica-
tions, shall apply with respect to every such appeal as if it were an appeal to

the Mining Act 1926 or any former Mining Act, being current transfers
or transmissions or leases or mortgages or encumbrances or other dis-
positions of or dealings with the licence or any interest therein or any
part thereof:
provided that, where any such document is also a grant of a mining privilege
that is not a licence within the meaning of this Act or is also a disposition of or
dealing with any such mining privilege, the Mining Registrar, instead of for-
warding to the Registrar-General of Land the document filed in the office of
the Mining Registrar, shall forward a copy thereof certified by him to be a true
copy.
(2)
Where the Mining Registrar has, under the provisions of subsection (1), for-
warded to the Registrar-General of Land any original licence or duplicate ori-
ginal licence or certified copy of a licence,—
(a)

warded to him or her by the Mining Registrar under the provisions of section 9.
(2)

shall continue to be entitled to the benefit of all interests to which the licence
was entitled at that date; and all such encumbrances, liens, and other interests
shall be preserved in the order of their existing priority, and shall thereafter,
notwithstanding variation in form, be dealt with as if the same or correspond-
ing interests had been originally created under the Land Transfer Act 2017; and

the bringing of that licence under the Land Transfer Act 2017 pursuant to this
