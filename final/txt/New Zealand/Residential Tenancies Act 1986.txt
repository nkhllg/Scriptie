must also be treated as if they were the landlord of any tenancy for which an
associated person of A is a landlord.
(2C) For the purposes of determining, under subsection (2B), how many tenancies a
landlord has or how many tenancies an associated person of the landlord has,
any tenancies related to a residential premises described in subsection (2D)
must be treated as if they were 1 tenancy.
(2D) Subsection (2C) applies to a residential premises that would be a boarding
house (within the meaning of section 66B) except that the premises are occu‐
pied, or intended to be occupied, by fewer than 6 tenants at any one time.
Example
A, a landlord, has 4 tenancies. Two of the tenancies relate to a house in which
the tenants have exclusive rights to occupy their respective sleeping quarters while
sharing some facilities (that is, the premises would be a boarding house except
that the premises are not occupied, or intended by the landlord to be occupied, by
at least 6 tenants). Under subsection (2C), those 2 tenancies must be treated as 1
tenancy. As a result, A is treated as having 3 tenancies.
A’s spouse, B, is also a landlord and has 4 tenancies. Under subsection (2B),
because B is an associated person of A, A must be treated as if A were also the
landlord of B’s 4 tenancies.
As a consequence, A is treated as having 7 tenancies for the purposes of any
provision of this Act that applies to landlords that have 6 or more tenancies.
If A commits an infringement offence in relation to one of A’s tenancies, A is liable
to the fine or the infringement fee that applies to landlords who have 6 or more
tenancies.

condition; and
(c)
does not pose a risk to health and safety (including during work to
install, remove, or undo the minor change) that cannot reasonably prac‐
ticably be eliminated or minimised; and
(d)
does not compromise the structural integrity, weathertightness, or char‐
acter of any building; and
(e)
would not have an unreasonable negative effect on any person’s enjoy‐
ment or use of any property outside the premises; and
(f)
does not require any regulatory consent (for example, a building con‐
sent); and
(g)
does not breach any obligation or restriction relevant to the premises (for
example, an obligation or a restriction imposed by a bylaw, a planning or
body corporate rule, or a covenant).
(3)
A landlord commits an unlawful act if the landlord withholds consent for a
minor change.
(4)
If a minor change is made in accordance with a request under section 42A, the
tenant must, on or before the expiry of the tenancy, return the premises to a
condition that is substantially the same as the condition that the premises were
in before the minor change was made.

Subsection (4) does not apply if the landlord and the tenant agree a different
arrangement in relation to the minor change for the end of the tenancy (for
example, that the minor change will remain in place).
(6)
A tenant who fails to comply with subsection (4) commits an unlawful act.

Where any party to a tenancy agreement breaches any of the provisions of the

the damage or loss arising from that breach, in accordance with the rules of law
relating to mitigation of loss or damage upon breach of contract.

Responsibility for damage
Heading: inserted, on 27 August 2019, by section 8 of the Residential Tenancies Amendment Act
2019 (2019 No 37).
49A
General principle
(1)
Except as provided in section 49B, a tenant has no liability or obligation, and
must not be required, to—
(a)
meet the cost of making good any destruction of, or damage to, the
premises; or
(b)
indemnify the landlord against the cost of making good the destruction
or damage; or
(c)
pay damages related to the destruction or damage; or
(d)
carry out any works to make good the destruction or damage.
(2)
A tenant is not, in any case, liable for fair wear and tear.
Section 49A: inserted, on 27 August 2019, by section 8 of the Residential Tenancies Amendment Act
2019 (2019 No 37).
49B
When tenant liable
(1)
A tenant is not excused from liability or obligation by section 49A(1) if, and to
the extent that,—
(a)
the destruction or damage was intentionally done or caused by the tenant
or by a person for whose actions the tenant is responsible under section
41 or 66L; or
(b)
the destruction or damage was the result of an act or omission by the
tenant or by a person for whose actions the tenant is responsible under
section 41 or 66L and the act or omission occurred on or about the
premises and constitutes an imprisonable offence.
(2)
To the extent provided in subsection (3), the tenant is liable to the landlord for
destruction of, or damage to, the premises that is caused by a careless act or
omission of the tenant or of a person for whose actions the tenant is responsible
under section 41 or 66L, other than an act or omission described in subsection
(1).
(3)
The tenant’s liability under subsection (2) is limited,—
Version as at
20 March 2025
Residential Tenancies Act 1986
Part 2 s 49B
77

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a)
if the property is insured against the destruction or damage, to the lesser
of the applicable excess under the insurance and whichever of the fol‐
lowing is applicable:
(i)
if the tenant pays an income-related rent within the meaning of
section 2(1) of the Public and Community Housing Management
Act 1992, the market rent within the meaning of section 2(1) of
that Act for the premises for a period of 4 weeks:
(ii)
in any other case, the rent under the tenancy agreement for a
period of 4 weeks; or
(b)
otherwise, to whichever of the following is applicable:
(i)
if the tenant pays an income-related rent within the meaning of
section 2(1) of the Public and Community Housing Management
Act 1992, the market rent within the meaning of section 2(1) of
that Act for the premises for a period of 4 weeks:
(ii)
in any other case, the rent under the tenancy agreement for a
period of 4 weeks.
(4)
However,—
(a)
if any insurance moneys that would otherwise have been payable
because of the destruction or damage are irrecoverable because of an
act or omission of the tenant or of a person for whose actions the tenant
is responsible under section 41 or 66L, for the purposes of subsection (3)
the property is treated as not insured against the destruction or damage
(and therefore subsection (3)(b) sets out the limit of the tenant’s liability
under subsection (2)); and
(b)
see also clause 19 of Schedule 1AA (for other circumstances where sub‐
section (3)(b) sets out the limit of the tenant’s liability under subsection
(2), regardless of whether the property is insured against the destruction
or damage).
(5)
To avoid doubt, a tenant’s liability under subsection (2) may, if the tenancy
agreement so provides or the tenant and landlord so agree, be satisfied by the
tenant carrying out works to make good the destruction or damage up to a
value of the liability limit in subsection (3).
(6)
Unless the damage is the result of an action described in subsection (1), a
tenant’s obligations under section 42(6) (removal of a fixture) to repair damage
or to compensate the landlord for expenses incurred in repairing damage are
limited to work of a value, or payment of an amount, up to the liability limit set
out in subsection (3).
(7)
Destruction or damage of which the landlord becomes aware after this section
comes into force is presumed to have occurred after this section came into
force unless the tenant proves otherwise.

during any tenancy to which this Act applies,—
(a)
it is for the landlord to prove—
(i)
that any damage is not fair wear and tear; and
(ii)
that any destruction or damage occurred in circumstances
described in subsection (1)(b); and
(iii)
that any insurance moneys are irrecoverable for the reasons
described in subsection (4)(a); and
(b)

that any destruction or damage was not intentionally done or
caused as described in subsection (1)(a); and
(ii)

omission described in subsection (2).

Landlord, not insurer, to benefit from tenant liability for careless damage
(1)
An insurer of the premises against destruction or damage has no right or claim
in relation to a tenant’s liability under section 49B(2) or (6), including no
right of equitable or contractual subrogation and no right arising out of an
assignment by the insured.
(2)
If an insured receives or is entitled to receive any money or benefit arising out
of a tenant’s liability under section 49B(2) or (6), an insurer of the premises
may not take that money or benefit into account in calculating the amount
payable under the insurance.

payment of an amount related to destruction of, or damage to,
the premises that exceeds the tenant’s liability in accordance with
section 49B; or

the carrying out of any works to make good destruction of, or
damage to, the premises the value of which exceeds the tenant’s
liability in accordance with section 49B:

the tenant is obligated—

intention to terminate the tenancy on a particular date or on the expiry of a
particular period is stated clearly in the notice, and that any non-compliance is
not such as to mislead or affect unjustly the interests of the recipient.
(5)
A notice to terminate a tenancy may be given on any day, and the period of
notice may be expressed to expire on any day, regardless of the date on which
the tenancy commenced or of any date on which any rent is to be paid.
(6)
A party who has given an effective notice to terminate a tenancy—
(a)
may, at any time before the expiry of the period of notice, revoke the
notice with the consent of the other party; but
(b)
may give a further notice to terminate the tenancy only if the prior notice
is revoked.
(7)
Where a party has given a notice to terminate the tenancy and subsequently
realises that, because of—
(a)
some error in the way in which the period of the notice or the date of the
expiry of that period is expressed in the notice; or
(b)
some delay in serving the notice,—
the period of notice given is less than the minimum prescribed by subsection
(1) or (as the case may require) subsection (2) or (2A), that party may, with the
agreement of the other party or (failing such agreement) with the consent of the
Tribunal, give to the other party a further notice varying the first notice so as to
bring the period of notice given up to or above that minimum so required.
(8)
Every notice given under subsection (7) shall comply with the requirements of
subsection (3).
(9)
The Tribunal shall not give its consent under subsection (7) unless it is satis‐
fied—
(a)
that the error in the notice or the delay in serving the notice was inadver‐
tent; and
(b)
that the party who gave the notice has sought to correct the matter
as soon as practicable after realising that the period of notice given is
inadequate; and
(c)
that it would not be unfair to the other party to allow the original notice
to be varied in the manner proposed.
(10)
In subsection (2), termination date means the date of termination provided
for by the notice of termination given by the landlord (regardless of when
termination in fact occurs).

Provision for shorter notice may be made with consent of Tribunal
With the consent of the Tribunal, the parties to a tenancy agreement may
provide for the termination of the tenancy by the giving of notice of a specified

services has been terminated or either party has given notice to terminate that
contract (subject to subsections (2) to (7)).
(2)
Where the contract of service or, as the case requires, contract for services is
terminated, or the tenant is transferred to another district, on less than 14 days’
notice, the landlord may terminate the service tenancy by the giving of notice
of less than 14 days if—
(a)
the landlord believes on reasonable grounds that the tenant will cause
substantial damage to the premises if the tenant is permitted to remain
for 14 days; or
(b)
it is necessary for the conduct of the landlord’s business where the tenant
was employed that a replacement employee be appointed within less
than 14 days and no suitable alternative accommodation is available for
the replacement worker during the period of 14 days.

effect.
(4)
Where the tenant of a service tenancy dies leaving any dependant residing in
the premises, the landlord may terminate the tenancy by giving at least 14
days’ notice.
(5)
However, in any case to which subsection (4) applies, the landlord may termin‐
ate the tenancy by giving at least 5 days’ notice if it is necessary for the
conduct of the landlord’s business at the place of business where the tenant was
employed that a replacement employee be appointed within less than 14 days
and no suitable alternative accommodation is available for the replacement
worker during the period of 14 days.
(5A) Section 50A does not limit subsection (4) or (5).

so require.
(7)

purporting to have been given under this section is in issue, the following
provisions shall apply:
(a)
whether the contract of service or, as the case requires, contract for
services was or was not terminated shall be a question of fact to be
determined by the Tribunal, but the Tribunal shall not be concerned with
the lawfulness or otherwise of that termination:
(b)
it shall be for the landlord to establish to the satisfaction of the Tribunal
the matters referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of subsection (2), and in

(1)
In this section, student tenancy means a tenancy to which this Act applies that
is granted by an institution (as defined in section 10(1) of the Education and
Training Act 2020) to a person who is eligible to be a tenant by virtue of the
person being—

a student; or
(b)
a student of a particular educational institution.
(2)
The landlord of a student tenancy, or the tenant of a student tenancy, may
terminate the tenancy by giving at least 14 days’ notice if the tenant ceases to
be eligible to be granted the tenancy.
(3)
In any proceedings before the Tribunal in which the validity of a notice under
subsection (2) is in issue, the question of when the tenant ceased to be eligible
to be a tenant under the tenancy is a question of fact to be determined by the
Tribunal.

Tribunal may declare notice retaliatory
(1)
This section applies in relation to a notice given by a landlord terminating the
tenancy, being a notice that complies with the requirements of section 51 (or, in
the case of a boarding house tenancy, section 66U).
(2)
The tenant may apply to the Tribunal for an order declaring that the notice was
retaliatory on either or both of the following grounds:
(a)
that, in giving the notice, the landlord was motivated wholly or partly
by the exercise or proposed exercise by the tenant of any right, power,
authority, or remedy conferred on the tenant by the tenancy agreement
Part 2 s 53A
Residential Tenancies Act 1986
Version as at
20 March 2025
86

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
or by this or any other Act or any complaint by the tenant against the
landlord relating to the tenancy:
(b)
that, in giving the notice, the landlord was motivated wholly or partly by
the exercise or performance, or proposed exercise or performance, by the
chief executive or any other person of any power or function conferred
on the person under this or any other Act in respect of the tenancy or
premises.
(3)
If the tenant makes the application within 28 working days after receiving the
termination notice, the tenant may at the same time apply for an order declaring
the notice to be of no effect.
(4)
If the Tribunal is satisfied that either or both of the grounds in subsection (2)
apply, the Tribunal must declare the notice to be retaliatory and, if an order is
applied for under subsection (3), of no effect.
(5)
However, the Tribunal need not declare the notice to be retaliatory and of
no effect if the Tribunal is satisfied that, in the case of subsection (2)(a), the
purported exercise by the tenant of any such right, power, authority, or remedy,
or the making by the tenant of any such complaint, was or would be vexatious
or frivolous to such an extent that the landlord was justified in giving the
notice.
(6)
The giving of a notice terminating a tenancy is an unlawful act if the notice is
declared under subsection (4) to be retaliatory.
Section 54: replaced, on 30 January 2025, by section 28 of the Residential Tenancies Amendment
Act 2024 (2024 No 52).

(1)
Subject to subsection (2), on any application made to it under this section by

the rent was, at the date on which the application was filed under section
86, at least 21 days in arrear; or
(aa)
the tenancy is a periodic tenancy and—
(i)
on 3 separate occasions within a 90-day period an amount of rent
has been owing for at least 5 working days after the date on which
it was due under the tenancy agreement; and
(ii)
on each occasion the landlord gave the tenant written notice advis‐
ing the tenant of the overdue rent, the dates for which rent was
overdue, the amount of overdue rent, and the tenant’s right to
make an application to the Tribunal challenging the notice (see
sections 77(1) and 78(1)(a) regarding the Tribunal); and
(iii)
each notice stated how many other notices (if any) the landlord
had given the tenant under this paragraph in relation to the same
tenancy and 90-day period; and

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(iv)
the landlord’s application to the Tribunal was made within 28 days
after the landlord gave the third notice; or
(b)
the tenant has caused, or has permitted any other person to cause, or has
threatened to cause, substantial damage to the premises; or
(c)
the tenant has assaulted, or has threatened to assault, or has caused or
permitted any person to assault, or to threaten to assault, any of the

any neighbour of the premises or of any building of which the
premises constitute a part.
(1A) Notwithstanding section 78(3), the Tribunal may, instead of making a final
termination order for the non-payment of rent under subsection (1)(a), make a
conditional order if, but only if, it is satisfied that—
(a)
the tenant will pay any rent in arrear within a period specified by the
Tribunal; and
(b)
it is unlikely that the tenant will commit any further breach of a kind to
which any of paragraphs (a), (b), and (c) of subsection (1) applies.
(1B) Any conditional order referred to in subsection (1A)—
(a)
shall set out the terms of repayment of any rent in arrear or any other
conditions attaching to the order; and
(b)
shall automatically take effect as a final termination order if the condi‐
tions are not complied with; and
(c)
shall lapse if the conditions are complied with.
(2)
The Tribunal may refuse to make an order under subsection (1) if, but only if,
it is satisfied that the breach has been remedied (where it is capable of remedy),
the landlord has been compensated for any loss arising from the breach, and it
is unlikely that the tenant will commit any further breach of a kind to which
this section applies (but see also section 78A(3)(b)).
(3)
It shall not be necessary for the landlord to give to the tenant notice of the
landlord’s intention to apply under this section for an order terminating the
tenancy.

55AA Termination by notice for physical assault by tenant
(1)
A landlord may terminate a fixed-term or periodic tenancy by giving at least 14

the landlord’s or owner’s family, or the landlord’s agent; and
(b)
a charge has been filed in respect of the physical assault against the
tenant by or on behalf of the Crown.
(2)
For the purpose of subsection (1)(b), a charge has been filed in respect of
a physical assault if the particulars of the charge describe a physical assault
against a person referred to in subsection (1)(a), regardless of the offence that
is specified in the charge.
(3)
A notice to terminate a tenancy under this section must—
(a)
be in the approved form and include the prescribed information; and
(b)
be accompanied by qualifying evidence of the matters in subsection
(1)(b); and
(c)
advise the tenant of the tenant’s right to make an application to the Tri‐
bunal challenging the notice (see sections 77(1) and 78(1)(a) regarding
the Tribunal); and
(d)

(4)
If the tenant makes an application to the Tribunal challenging the notice, it is
for the landlord to prove that the physical assault occurred and that the notice
met the requirements of subsection (3).

55A
Termination for anti-social behaviour
(1)
A landlord under a periodic tenancy may apply to the Tribunal for an order
terminating the tenancy on the ground of anti-social behaviour.
(2)
The Tribunal must (subject to subsection (3)) make the order if satisfied that—
(a)
on 3 separate occasions within a 90-day period the tenant, or a person
in the premises with the tenant’s permission (other than the landlord or
a person acting on the landlord’s behalf or with the landlord’s authority),
engaged in anti-social behaviour in connection with the tenancy; and
(b)
on each occasion the landlord gave the tenant written notice—
(i)
describing clearly which specific behaviour was considered to be
anti-social and (if known to the landlord) who engaged in it; and
(ii)
advising the tenant of the date, approximate time, and location of
the behaviour; and
(iii)
stating how many other notices (if any) the landlord has given the
tenant under this paragraph in connection with the same tenancy
and the same 90-day period; and

advising the tenant of the tenant’s right to make an application
to the Tribunal challenging the notice (see sections 77(1) and
78(1)(a) regarding the Tribunal); and
(c)
the landlord’s application to the Tribunal was made within 28 days after
the landlord gave the third notice.
(3)
However, the Tribunal must not make the order if satisfied that—
(a)
doing so would be unfair because of the circumstances in which the
behaviour occurred or the notices were given; or
Part 2 s 55A
Residential Tenancies Act 1986
Version as at

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b)
in making the application, the landlord was motivated wholly or partly
by the exercise or proposed exercise by the tenant of any right, power,
authority, or remedy conferred on the tenant by the tenancy agreement
or by this or any other Act or any complaint by the tenant against the
landlord relating to the tenancy (unless the Tribunal is satisfied that
the purported exercise or the complaint was or would be vexatious or
frivolous to such an extent that the landlord was justified in making the
application).
(4)
In deciding whether to make an order under subsection (2), the Tribunal must
not take into account the impact that terminating the tenancy would have on the
tenant.
(5)
In subsection (2)(a), if a tenant is in the premises at the same time as another
person (other than the landlord or a person acting on the landlord’s behalf
or with the landlord’s authority), the tenant is presumed to have permitted
the person to be in the premises unless the tenant proves that they took all
reasonable steps to prevent the person from entering the premises or to eject
the person from the premises.
(6)
If a tenant makes an application to the Tribunal challenging a notice given
under subsection (2)(b), it is for the landlord to prove that anti-social behaviour
was engaged in as described in subsection (2)(a) and that the notice met the
requirements of subsection (2)(b).
(7)
In this section, anti-social behaviour means—
(a)
harassment; or
(b)
any other act or omission (whether intentional or not), if the act or
omission reasonably causes alarm, distress, or nuisance that is more than
minor.

Termination where it would be unreasonable to require landlord to
continue with tenancy
(1)
A landlord under a periodic tenancy may apply to the Tribunal for an order
terminating the tenancy on the ground of hardship.
(2)
The Tribunal may make the order only if satisfied that—
(a)
without the order the landlord would suffer greater hardship than the
tenant; and
(b)
because of that hardship, it would be unreasonable to require the land‐
lord to continue with the tenancy.
(3)
In deciding whether it would be unreasonable to require the landlord to con‐
tinue with the tenancy, the Tribunal must take into account the impact that
terminating the tenancy would have on the tenant.

Termination for non-payment of rent and other breaches
(1)
On an application made to it under this section by the landlord or the tenant,
the Tribunal may make an order terminating the tenancy if the Tribunal is
satisfied that—
(a)
the other party has committed a breach of any of the provisions of the
tenancy agreement (including provisions relating to the payment of rent)
or of this Act; and
(b)
in the case of a breach capable of remedy,—
(i)
the applicant gave to the other party a notice specifying the nature
of the breach complained of and requiring the other party to
remedy the breach within a reasonable period, being not less than
14 days commencing with the day on which the notice was given;
and
(ii)
the other party failed to remedy the default within the required
period; and
(c)
that the breach is of such a nature or of such an extent that it would be
inequitable to refuse to make an order terminating the tenancy.
(2)
Where an application is made by a landlord under this section and the Tribunal
is satisfied that at the time of determining the matter the landlord could have
made an application under section 55, the Tribunal shall determine the matter
as if an application had been made under that section.

ceases to be responsible to the landlord for obligations under the tenancy
agreement and this Act, except in respect of any liability for anything
done or omitted to be done before the withdrawal; and
(b)
the tenancy continues in relation to the remaining tenants only; and
(c)
the withdrawing tenant must give each remaining tenant notice of the
withdrawal no later than the close of the day that is 2 days after the date
of the withdrawal; and
(d)
the amount of rent for which the remaining tenants are liable is reduced
as set out in subsection (5) (unless subsection (6) applies).

the tenancy agreement for the purposes of sections 13B and 13C, and the
reinstatement does not constitute a rent increase.

This section applies if testing in accordance with a relevant prescribed method
establishes contamination by a contaminant, in any part of the premises, at a

However, for the purposes of subsection (3), if the only part of the premises
that is established to be contaminated above the maximum inhabitable level is a
remote and inconsequential part of the premises (see subsection (8)),—

of the premises in a way that is likely to prevent the spread of the
contaminant to the rest of the premises (or is capable of being, and, after
contamination is established, is, physically removed from or physically
closed off to the rest of the premises in a way that is likely to prevent
that spread); and
(b)
the rest of the premises can reasonably be used, without that part, as
residential premises under the tenancy agreement.

Where a tenant remains in occupation of the premises after the tenancy has ter‐
minated or has been terminated, all the obligations of the tenant shall continue
in force as if the tenancy were still subsisting until such time as the tenant
ceases to occupy the premises.
(2)
If the landlord permits the tenant to remain in the premises for more than 90
days after the tenancy has terminated or has been terminated, without obtaining
a possession order, or for more than 90 days after obtaining a possession order,
the landlord shall be deemed to have granted, and the tenant shall be deemed
to have accepted, as from the date on which that period of 90 days expired, a
periodic tenancy of the premises on the same terms and conditions as pertained
to the original tenancy immediately before its termination.
(3)
The landlord shall not be taken to have permitted the tenant to remain in
possession, or to have given up the right to proceed under this Act in respect

Where, on the termination of the tenancy, the tenant leaves on the premises
foodstuffs or other perishable goods, the landlord may, immediately after tak‐
ing possession of the premises, dispose of those goods in any way the landlord
thinks fit.
(2)
If the tenant leaves on the premises goods that are neither foodstuffs nor other
perishable goods, the landlord must, immediately after taking possession of the
premises, make all reasonable efforts to contact the tenant and to agree with the
tenant on a period within which the tenant is to collect the goods.
(3)
If the landlord is unable to contact the tenant or to agree on a period with the
tenant, or if the tenant fails to collect the goods within the agreed period, the
landlord must ensure that any personal documents belonging to the tenant are
stored securely and must deal with the other goods either—
(a)
in accordance with section 62A; or
(b)
by securing them in safe storage and by applying to the Tribunal in
accordance with section 62B.

have established that the premises are contaminated, and regulations under this
Act prescribe a process (and associated duties) for dealing with the goods,
subsection (3) does not apply and those regulations must instead be complied
with.

Part 2 s 65

has caused, or will cause, serious hardship.

ational rules made under that Act; and
(b)
because of that change, it would be unreasonable to require the tenant to
continue with the tenancy.

rent by a substantial amount, to make such order relating to the rent as it

that term would otherwise be contrary to any of the provisions of this
Act:

(m)
to order the landlord or the tenant under any tenancy agreement to which

(o)
to consider and determine any complaint by any party to a tenancy
agreement or by the chief executive that any person has committed an

order the payment of such sum in the nature of exemplary damages,
not exceeding the maximum prescribed by this Act, as the Tribunal may
think just:
(p)
to approve the assignment by the tenant of the rights of the tenant under
any tenancy agreement to which this Act applies, or the subletting by
the tenant under any such tenancy agreement of the whole or any part
of the premises, where the Tribunal finds that the landlord has withheld

prohibited by the tenancy agreement:

any person from any such premises, regardless of the value of the premises or
the amount of any rent payable for the premises.
(4)
In respect of tenancy agreements, the Tribunal has jurisdiction to exercise,
and may exercise, all the powers conferred on a court by section 264 of the
Property Law Act 2007 (which relates to the granting of relief to the tenant
against the landlord’s refusal to enter into a renewal of a tenancy agreement or
to sell the landlord’s interest in the premises to the tenant).
(4A) The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to determine a dispute so far as it raises
a question as to the landlord’s conduct in the landlord’s capacity as a provider
of health or disability services and the conduct is of a kind about which a
complaint may be made under the Health and Disability Commissioner Act
1994.
(5)
Despite subsection (1), the Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to require any
party to pay any sum, or to do any work to a value, or otherwise to incur any
expenditure, in excess of $100,000.
(6)
Subsection (5) shall not prevent a party from abandoning so much of a claim
as exceeds $100,000 in order to bring the claim within the jurisdiction of the
Tribunal; and, in any such case, an order of the Tribunal under this Act in
relation to the claim shall operate to discharge from liability in respect of the
amount so abandoned any person against whom the claim and the subsequent
order is made.
(7)
Subsection (5) does not affect a claim relating to a tenancy that is for a balance
of not more than $100,000 that results from a set-off or any counterclaim in
respect of the same tenancy, if the set-off or counterclaim is admitted by the
claimant in the notice of claim.
(7AA) If the chief executive files an application under section 86(1A) that relates
to 2 or more tenancies or proceedings are consolidated under section 124B(4),
subsection (5) does not prevent the Tribunal from requiring a party to pay any
sum, or to do any work to a value, or otherwise to incur any expenditure, in
excess of $100,000 so long as the amount required in respect of each tenancy
does not exceed $100,000.
(7A) The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to consent to a person charging a tenant
a letting fee.
(7B) The Tribunal does not have jurisdiction to determine a dispute so far as it raises
a question as to whether, in respect of a tenant who gives notice accompanied
by qualifying evidence under section 56B,—
(a)
the tenant has been a victim of family violence while a tenant of the
premises; or
(b)
the tenant’s dependant has been a victim of family violence while resid‐
ing at the premises with the tenant.

78
Orders of Tribunal
(1)
Without limiting the generality of section 77 or the nature or extent of orders
that the Tribunal may make in the exercise of its jurisdiction, the Tribunal may,
in respect of any claim within its jurisdiction (but subject to section 78A, if that
section applies), make 1 or more of the following orders:
(a)
an order in the nature of a declaration, whether as to the status for the
purposes of this Act of any premises or of any agreement or purported
agreement, or as to the rights or obligations of any party, or otherwise:
(b)
an order that a party yield possession of any premises to any other party:
(c)
an order that a party deliver any specific chattels to any other party:
(d)
an order that a party pay money to any other party:
(e)
a work order:
(f)
where it appears to the Tribunal that an agreement between the parties,
or any term of any such agreement, is harsh or unconscionable, or that
any power conferred by an agreement between them has been exercised
in a harsh or unconscionable manner, an order varying the agreement, or
setting it aside (either wholly or in part):
(g)
where it appears to the Tribunal that an agreement between the parties
has been induced by fraud, misrepresentation, or mistake, or that any
writing purporting to express the agreement between the parties does not
accord with their true agreement, an order varying, or setting aside, the
agreement or the writing (either wholly or in part):
(h)
any other order that the High Court or the District Court may make
under any enactment or rule of law relating to contracts:
Part 3 s 78
Residential Tenancies Act 1986
Version as at
20 March 2025
142

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(i)
an order dismissing an application.
(1A) A person with an interest in premises that are not subject to a tenancy agree‐
ment may apply, without notice, to the Tribunal for an order under subsection
(1)(a) declaring the status of the premises for the purposes of this Act.
(1B) An order made on an application under subsection (1A) is binding on all
parties to any subsequent proceedings before the Tribunal, but the Tribunal
may, on application made in any such proceedings, rescind the order if satisfied
that the order is wrong or, because of a change in circumstances, no longer
applicable.
(2)
Where the Tribunal makes a work order against a party, it—
(a)
shall, where the order is made otherwise than by consent; and
(b)
may, where the order is made by consent,—
at the same time make an order under subsection (1)(d) to be complied with as
an alternative to compliance with the work order.
(2AA) Subsection (2) does not apply if the work order is a section 78A work order or
if the work order, or any part of the work order, relates to any of the following:
(a)
smoke alarms:
(b)
a failure to comply with the healthy homes standards:
(ba)
decontamination:
(c)
a failure to comply with a standard of fitness or other requirement
applying by virtue of section 120C of the Health Act 1956:
(d)
a failure to comply with any other requirement relating to health or
safety under any enactment.
(2AAB) A work order may include a provision authorising the party in whose favour
the order is made—
(a)
to undertake any work covered by the order if—
(i)
the order is not complied with by the other party; and
(ii)
the other party has not complied with the alternative money order
provided for by subsection (2) (if any); and
(b)
to charge the cost of undertaking the work (up to the amount specified
by the Tribunal) to the other party.
(2AABA) Subsection (2AAB) does not apply if the work order is a section 78A work
order.
(2AAC) Where any provision is made under subsection (2AAB)—
(a)
in favour of the landlord, the cost incurred by the landlord in under‐
taking any work in accordance with the provision (up to the amount
specified by the Tribunal) is treated as rent in arrear and enforceable
accordingly; or
Version as at
20 March 2025
Residential Tenancies Act 1986
Part 3 s 78
143

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b)
in favour of the tenant, the tenant may set off the cost incurred in under‐
taking any work in accordance with the provision (up to the amount
specified by the Tribunal) against rent payable by the tenant.
(2AAD) Without limiting subsection (2AAC)(b), where the tenant becomes author‐
ised by any provision made under subsection (2AAB) to undertake any work,
the tenant may pay to the chief executive any sum that would otherwise be
payable by way of rent, up to the amount specified by the Tribunal, until
sufficient has been accumulated to enable the tenant to undertake the work.
(2AAE) Where any sum is paid to the chief executive under subsection (2AAD), the
chief executive must give to the tenant a receipt showing the particulars of the
payment, and must send a copy of the receipt to the landlord.
(2AAF) Any money paid to the chief executive under subsection (2AAD) must be
paid by the chief executive into the Residential Tenancies Trust Account, and
must be paid out of that Account by the chief executive to the tenant if the
chief executive is satisfied that the money is to be applied by the tenant to meet
the cost of the work.
(2AAG) The inclusion in a work order of any provision under subsection (2AAB)
does not limit any other rights or remedies of the party in whose favour the
order is made.
(2A) Where the Tribunal makes an order under any of paragraphs (b), (c), or (h)
of subsection (1), the Tribunal may at the same time make an order under
subsection (1)(d) to be complied with as an alternative to compliance with the
first-mentioned order.
(2AB) The Tribunal may record in an order made under subsection (1)(d) (a money
order) that the parties have agreed to enforce the payment of the amount
specified in that order by way of an attachment order made under the District
Court Act 2016 if—
(a)
the money order was made at a hearing at which both parties were
present; and
(b)
the party ordered to pay money consented to the payment of the money
being enforced by way of an attachment order; and
(c)
both parties agreed on the terms of the attachment order, including the
details specified in subsection (2AC).
(2AC) If subsection (2AB) applies, the money order must include the following
details:
(a)
the employer to whom the attachment order will relate; and
(b)
whether deductions are to be made every week, fortnight, or month, or
by reference to some other period (the earnings period); and
(c)
the amount or percentage to be deducted from salary or wages for the
earnings period; and
Part 3 s 78
Residential Tenancies Act 1986
Version as at
20 March 2025
144

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(d)
the amount or percentage below which the net amount paid for the
earnings period must not fall; and
(e)
the name and address of the person to whom the amounts deducted are
to be paid; and
(f)
that the attachment order is to remain in force until the amount specified
in the money order has been paid in full or, if the attachment order is to
remain in force for a fixed period, that period.
(2AD) Nothing in subsection (2AC)(d) allows the parties to agree on a net amount

the Tribunal thinks fit to impose.

Orders of Tribunal relating to unlawful residential premises
(1)
This section applies in any matter where the Tribunal, on application by a party
or otherwise on the evidence before the Tribunal in respect of any claim within
its jurisdiction, determines or declares that the premises are, or were at any
material time, unlawful residential premises.
(2)
For the purposes of this Act, unlawful residential premises means residential
premises that are used for occupation for a person as a place of residence but—
(a)
that cannot lawfully be occupied for residential purposes by that person
(whether generally or whether for the particular residential purposes for
which that person is granted occupation); and
Part 3 s 78A

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b)
where the landlord’s failure to comply with the landlord’s obligations
under section 36 or 45(1)(c), or section 66H(2)(c) or 66I(1)(c), as rele‐
vant, has caused the occupation by that person to be unlawful or has
contributed to that unlawful occupation.
(3)
Despite anything to the contrary elsewhere in this Act,—
(a)
unless the Tribunal is satisfied that, having regard to the special circum‐
stances of the matter, including the nature of the premises, it would be
unjust not to make the order, the Tribunal must not order the tenant to
pay to the landlord—
(i)
any sum found to be owing by way of rent in arrear; or
(ii)
any other sum by way of damages or compensation:
(b)
if the landlord has applied for termination on the ground of rent in arrear,
the Tribunal may, but is not required to, make the order terminating the
tenancy.
(4)
Without limiting the generality of section 77 or the nature or extent of orders
that the Tribunal may make in accordance with this Act in relation to the
matter,—
(a)
the Tribunal may order the landlord to pay to the tenant—
(i)
the whole of the sum found to have been paid by way of rent for
the period for which the Tribunal is satisfied that the premises are
or were unlawful residential premises; or
(ii)
an amount that is the sum referred to in subparagraph (i) less any
amount that the Tribunal is satisfied, having regard to the special
circumstances of the matter, including the nature of the premises,
it is fair to deduct:
(b)
a section 78A work order may comprise or include an order that the
landlord take the steps available to the landlord, as specified in the order,
to (or to endeavour to)—
(i)
remove or rectify any impediment to the tenant lawfully occupy‐
ing the premises for residential purposes; or
(ii)
comply with all requirements in respect of buildings, health, or
safety under any enactment so far as they apply to the premises.
(5)
Even if the tenant does not apply for a particular order, the Tribunal may make
any of the following orders on its own initiative:
(a)
any order under subsection (4)(a); and
(b)
any section 78A work order; and
(c)
any other order, authorised by this Act, that is in favour of the tenant
(including, without limitation, an order under section 109 for an amount
in the nature of exemplary damages for failure to comply with section
45(1)(c) or 66I(1)(c)).

Jurisdiction to make interim orders
(1)
In respect of any matter in which the Tribunal has jurisdiction under this
Act to make any final determination, the Tribunal may from time to time, on
application by any party whether made ex parte or otherwise, make any interim
order of a mandatory or prohibitory nature designed to preserve the position of
the parties pending the final determination of the matter.
(2)
Where any such interim order is made on the ex parte application of any party,
the other party may at any time apply to the Tribunal for the cancellation of
that order.
80
Orders of Tribunal to be final
Subject to sections 105 and 117 to 120, every order made by the Tribunal shall,
unless it is expressed to be an interim order made under section 79, be final and
binding on all parties to the proceedings.
81
Exclusion of Tribunal’s jurisdiction prohibited
(1)
A provision in any tenancy agreement to which this Act applies, or in any
other agreement entered into by the parties to any such tenancy agreement, to
exclude or limit—
(a)
the jurisdiction of the Tribunal; or
(b)
the right of any person to invoke that jurisdiction—
shall be of no effect.
(2)
Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the Tribunal shall have juris‐
diction in respect of a claim notwithstanding any agreement relating to the
matter that provides for—
(a)
the submission to arbitration of any dispute or difference; or
(b)
the making of an award upon such a submission to be a condition
precedent to any cause of action accruing to a party to the agreement.
(3)
Subsection (1) does not apply where a cause of action has accrued, or is
believed to have accrued, to a person and that person has agreed to the settle‐
ment or compromise of the claim based on that cause of action.
82
Exclusion of other jurisdictions
(1)
Notwithstanding any other enactment or rule of law to the contrary, no court
or other body shall have originating jurisdiction in respect of any matter that is

(a)
proceedings in respect of that matter were commenced before that court
or other body before the commencement of this Act; or
(b)
an order is made under section 83(2).

(2)
Where subsection (1)(a) applies to proceedings before a court or other body,
the issues in dispute in the claim to which those proceedings relate (whether
as shown in the initial claim or emerging in the course of the hearing) shall
not be the subject of proceedings between the same parties before the Tribunal
unless the proceedings are transferred to the Tribunal under subsection (3), or
the claim before the court or other body is withdrawn, abandoned, or struck
out.
(3)
In any case to which subsection (1)(a) applies, the court or other body before
which the proceedings were being conducted immediately before the date of
the commencement of this Act may, with the consent of each of the parties,
instead of determining the matter itself, order that the proceedings be transfer‐
red to the Tribunal subject to such provision (if any) as to the payment of costs
as the court or other body thinks fit.
(4)
Where proceedings are transferred to the Tribunal under subsection (3), the
Tribunal may have regard to any notes of evidence transmitted to the Tribunal,
and it shall not be necessary for that evidence to be given again before the
Tribunal unless the Tribunal so requires.
83
Transfer of proceedings to District Court
(1)
Where any proceedings have been commenced before the Tribunal that the
Tribunal has no jurisdiction to hear and determine, the Tribunal may, instead of
striking out the proceedings, order that they be transferred to the District Court
in its ordinary civil jurisdiction.
(2)
The Tribunal may order that any proceedings be transferred to the District
Court in its ordinary civil jurisdiction if the Tribunal is satisfied that the
proceedings would be more properly determined in that court.
(3)
The Tribunal shall not make an order under subsection (1) or subsection (2)
in respect of a claim if any agreement of a kind described in section 81(2)
requires that the claim be submitted to arbitration.
(4)
Any proceedings transferred to the District Court under this section shall be
deemed to have been commenced by action in that court, and shall be dealt
with by that court accordingly.

require the landlord, in the application,—
(a)
to state whether the landlord wants the application to be dealt with under

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
under this Act or of any directions given by the Principal Tenancy Adjudicator,
the application is of a class that is to be referred directly to the Tribunal, in
which case the chief executive must refer the application to the appropriate
Registrar.
(1A) Despite subsection (1), an application under section 61(1) must be referred
directly to the Tribunal and the chief executive must refer the application to the
appropriate Registrar accordingly.
(2)
Despite subsection (1), if either party informs the chief executive that that
party refuses to have the matter considered by a Tenancy Mediator, the chief
executive must refer the application to the appropriate Registrar.
(3)
For the purposes of this section and section 88, the appropriate Registrar
is the Registrar nearest any premises in respect of which an application is
made under this Act or any other Registrar that the chief executive considers
appropriate for the purposes of the application.
(4)
The chief executive must ensure that a Tenancy Mediator to whom an applica‐
tion is referred is, and continues during the case to be, independent of each of
the parties.
(5)
If any of the State services is a party, the Tenancy Mediator’s independence
cannot be challenged just because the Tenancy Mediator is an officer or
employee of any of the State services.

88
Functions of Tenancy Mediators
(1)
The primary function of a Tenancy Mediator in respect of an application
referred to the Tenancy Mediator under section 87 is to attempt to bring the
parties to the dispute to an agreed settlement.
(2)
Where an agreed settlement is reached, the Tenancy Mediator may, to give
effect to the settlement, make any order or orders that the Tribunal could have
made if the application had come before it.
Part 3 s 88
Residential Tenancies Act 1986
Version as at
20 March 2025
152

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3)
If it appears to the Tenancy Mediator that it is unlikely that an agreed settle‐
ment can be reached within a reasonable time, the Tenancy Mediator—
(a)
shall report accordingly to the chief executive who shall refer the appli‐
cation to the appropriate Registrar for determination by the Tribunal; and
(b)
shall, wherever practicable, after consultation with the chief executive
and the appropriate Registrar, inform the parties of the date on which the
Tribunal is likely to be able to hear the matter.
(4)
In any case to which subsection (3)(a) applies, the Tenancy Mediator may
include in the Tenancy Mediator’s report to the chief executive any statement
of facts agreed to by the parties, a summary of the points settled in mediation
and those still requiring determination by the Tribunal, and any comments that
the Tenancy Mediator may wish to make on the conduct of the parties so far as
that may be relevant to the question of costs before the Tribunal in accordance
with section 102(2)(c), but shall in all respects strictly observe the provisions
of sections 89 and 90.
(5)
The chief executive and the chief executive of the Ministry of Justice must
make arrangements under which an order made by a Tenancy Mediator to give
effect to an agreed settlement will be referred to a Tenancy Adjudicator or
Registrar for sealing on an application made by the Tenancy Mediator or a
party—
(a)
to the appropriate Registrar; or
(b)
by any electronic means (for example, through an Internet site) approved
by the chief executive and the chief executive of the Ministry of Justice
(if the arrangements allow applications to be made by electronic means).
(5A) The Tenancy Adjudicator or Registrar must seal a copy of the order, unless
subsection (6) or (6A) applies.
(6)
Where that Tenancy Adjudicator believes that the order made by the Tenancy
Mediator is outside the powers of the Tenancy Mediator to make, the Tenancy
Adjudicator shall, instead of sealing the copy of the order,—
(a)
decline to seal the order, and direct the chief executive to refer the matter
to a Tenancy Mediator for further consideration in accordance with any
directions given by the Tenancy Adjudicator; or
(b)
direct that the matter be reconsidered and determined by the Tribunal.
(6A) Where a Registrar to whom an order has been referred for sealing considers
that the order is outside the powers of the Tenancy Mediator to make, the
Registrar must, instead of sealing the copy of the order, decline to seal the
order and refer the order to a Tenancy Adjudicator for consideration.
(6B) If an order is referred to a Tenancy Adjudicator under subsection (6A), he or
she must treat the order as if it had been referred directly to him or her under
subsection (5).

(7)
Where any copy of an order made by a Tenancy Mediator is sealed under this
section, it shall have effect as an order of the Tribunal, and shall be enforceable
accordingly.
(8)
If a Tenancy Mediator makes an order under section 78(1)(d) to give effect to
an agreed settlement, section 78(2AB) to (2AD) apply to the order, subject to
the following modifications:
(a)
section 78(2AB) and (2AD) must be read as if—
(i)
the references to the money order were references to the agreed
settlement; and
(ii)
the reference to the Tribunal were a reference to the Tenancy
Mediator; and
(iii)
the reference to a hearing were a reference to mediation:
(b)
the order made by the Tenancy Mediator under section 78(1)(d) may be
filed in the District Court to be enforced as an attachment order only if it
is sealed under this section.

to ascertain whether the tenant wants to contest the abandonment appli‐
cation.
Stage 2
(4)

Witness summons
(1)
For the purposes of a hearing before the Tribunal, the Tribunal may of its
own motion, and shall on the application of any party to the proceedings,
issue in writing a witness summons requiring the person named in the witness
summons to attend before the Tribunal and to give evidence, or to produce any
document or thing in that person’s possession or under that person’s control,
relevant to the proceedings.
(2)
The power to issue a witness summons under subsection (1) may be exercised
by the Tribunal, or by the Registrar acting by the direction, or with the author‐
ity, of the Tribunal.
(3)
A witness summons shall be served at least 5 working days before the date on
which the attendance of the witness is required, unless in special circumstances
the Tribunal directs otherwise.
(4)
Every witness attending a hearing of the Tribunal pursuant to a witness sum‐
mons shall be entitled to a sum for that witness’s travelling allowances, travel‐
ling expenses, and fees at the rate for the time being prescribed, except that,
in any particular case, the Tribunal may disallow the whole or any part of that
sum if it considers it just to do so.
(5)
The allowances, travelling expenses, and fees payable to a witness pursuant to
subsection (4) shall be paid by such party or parties to the proceedings as the
Tribunal shall order or, if the Tribunal so decides, shall be paid out of money
appropriated by Parliament for the purpose.
(6)
A witness summons may be set aside by the Tribunal or by the Principal
Tenancy Adjudicator if the Tribunal or the Principal Tenancy Adjudicator
considers that the summons relates to documents in respect of which any
person may have a claim of privilege against disclosure, or that the summons
is oppressive, whether because it is too wide or too uncertain or because of
lack of time for the person served with the summons to have a reasonable
opportunity to comply with it, or for any other reason.
(6A) A witness summons must be in a form approved by the chief executive of the
Ministry of Justice after consulting the Principal Tenancy Adjudicator.
(7)
Every witness summons shall include a statement informing the person sum‐
moned of the right to apply to the Tribunal under subsection (6) to have the
summons set aside on the ground that it relates to privileged documents or that
compliance with it would be oppressive to that person.

Tribunal upon, any matter of fact having a bearing upon the proceedings, and
may give to the Tenancy Mediator all such directions as to the nature, scope,
and conduct of the inquiry as the Tribunal thinks fit.
(2)

by the Registrar of the court under the District Court Act 2016.

107
Enforcement of orders other than possession orders and work orders

Every order made by the Tribunal other than a possession order or a work order
shall be deemed to be an order of the District Court, and, subject to this section,
may be enforced accordingly.
(2)
Where application is made to the District Court for the issue of any process to
enforce an order provided for by subsection (2) or subsection (2A) of section

with a work order or an order other than a monetary order), the Registrar shall
give written notice of the application to the party against whom enforcement is
sought.

If that party does not file in the court, within 10 working days after receiving
notice of the application, a notice of objection, the order may, after the expiry
of that period, be enforced pursuant to subsection (1).
(4)
The notice referred to in subsection (3) may be given only on the ground that
it is the belief of the party giving it that the order of the Tribunal has been
fully complied with and that the party therefore disputes the entitlement of the
applicant to enforce it.

If the party against whom enforcement is sought files the notice referred to in
subsection (3) within the prescribed time, the Registrar shall refer the matter to
the Tribunal to be heard and determined under section 108(2).

(c)
(except in the case of a section 78A work order) make an order empow‐
ering the party in whose favour the work order was made to undertake
the necessary work and to charge the cost of doing so (up to the amount

(d)
discharge or amend any order previously made by the Tribunal.

(b)
in favour of the tenant, the tenant may set off the cost incurred in under‐
taking the work (up to the amount specified by the Tribunal) against rent
payable by the tenant.

Without limiting subsection (3)(b), where any order is made under subsection
(2)(c), the tenant may pay to the chief executive any sum that would otherwise
be payable by way of rent, up to the amount specified by the Tribunal, until

executive shall give to the tenant a receipt showing the particulars of the
payment, and shall send a copy of the receipt to the landlord.

cost of the work.

After the expiration of 12 months from the date of a work order, it shall not be
enforced without the leave of the Tribunal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b)
12 months after the date of commission of the unlawful act in the case of
any other unlawful act.
(2A) The chief executive may not apply under subsection (1) (whether acting as the
person responsible for the general administration of this Act or in the place of
a landlord or a tenant) later than 12 months after the date on which the chief
executive first became aware of the unlawful act.
(3)
If, on an application under subsection (1) (other than one referred to in subsec‐
tion (3A)), the Tribunal is satisfied that the person against whom the order is
sought committed the unlawful act intentionally, and that, having regard to—
(a)
the intent of that person in committing the unlawful act; and
(b)
the effect of the unlawful act; and
(c)
the interests of the landlord or the tenant against whom the unlawful act
was committed; and
(d)
the public interest,—
it would be just to require the person against whom the order is sought to pay
a sum in the nature of exemplary damages, the Tribunal may make an order
accordingly.
(3A) In the case of an application in respect of an unlawful act under section 54(6),
the Tribunal may order the landlord to pay a sum in the nature of exemplary
damages if the Tribunal is satisfied that it is just to do so having regard to the
matters referred to in subsection (3)(b) to (d).

for any unlawful act referred to in any section shown in column 1 of Schedule
1A is the amount shown opposite that section in column 3 of that schedule.

committed an unlawful act even though the conduct that formed part of that act
also formed part of an offence or an alleged offence against section 109A(4) in
respect of which the person has been charged, convicted, or acquitted.
(5)
Any amount ordered by the Tribunal to be paid under this section on the appli‐
cation of a landlord or a tenant, or on the application of the chief executive
acting in place of a landlord or a tenant, shall be paid to that landlord or that
tenant, and shall be in addition to any sum payable to that landlord or that
tenant by way of compensation in respect of the unlawful act.

Waiver by landlord of breach by tenant
A waiver by the landlord of any breach by the tenant, or a failure by the
landlord to enforce any obligation by the tenant, shall not,—
(a)
where the breach is of a continuing nature, prevent the landlord from
enforcing the obligation in future; or
(b)
where the breach is not of a continuing nature, prevent the landlord
from exercising any remedy in the event of a subsequent breach by the
tenant;—
but any such waiver or failure to enforce may be taken into consideration by
the Tribunal if the landlord subsequently applies to the Tribunal for an order
terminating the tenancy.
134A Method of payment
Any amount that is, by virtue of any provision of this Act or of any order of
the Tribunal, to be paid to the chief executive must be paid using a payment
method approved by the chief executive.

Recovery of money paid by mistake
(1)
Subject to subsection (2), where one party to a tenancy agreement pays any
amount to the other party under a mistake of law or fact relating to the agree‐
ment, that party may, upon application to the Tribunal, recover that amount
from the other party.
(2)
In any case to which subsection (1) applies, the Tribunal may decline to order
the repayment of the amount in question, in whole or in part, if the Tribunal is
satisfied that the person who received the money did so in good faith, and has
so altered his or her position in reliance on the validity of the payment that, in
the opinion of the Tribunal, having regard to all possible implications in respect
of other persons, it would be unfair to order the repayment of the whole or any
part of that amount.
