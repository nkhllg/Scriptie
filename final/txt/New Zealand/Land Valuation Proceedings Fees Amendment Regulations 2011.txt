Explanatory note
This note is not part of the regulations, but is intended to indicate
their general effect.
These regulations, which come into force on 1 July 2011, are made
under the Land Valuation Proceedings Act 1948 (the Act). They
amend fees regulations made under the Act. The fees for filing and
hearing applications, claims, objections, or other proceedings are ad-
justed to reflect the movement in the New Zealand Consumers Price
Index (All Groups) since 1 July 2004.
The fees replaced are inclusive of goods and services tax (GST),
but were not amended directly to reflect the 1 October 2010 GST
increase, and so differed from those actually charged. The new fees
are also GST inclusive.
