Explanatory note
This note is not part of the regulations, but is intended to indicate
their general effect.
These regulations, which come into force on 1 July 2011, are made
under the Property Law Act 2007 (the Act).

gagees’ sales forms and fees regulations made under the Act. An ap-
plication fee and minimum and maximum commission fees for sales
by a vendor mortgagee through a Registrar are adjusted to reflect the
movement in the New Zealand Consumers Price Index (All Groups)
since those regulations came into force on 1 January 2008.

Explanatory note
The fees replaced are inclusive of goods and services tax (GST),
but were not amended directly to reflect the 1 October 2010 GST

are also GST inclusive.
