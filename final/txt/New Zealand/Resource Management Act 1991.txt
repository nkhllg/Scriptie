36AAA Criteria for fixing administrative charges
(1)
When fixing charges under section 36, a local authority must have regard to the
criteria set out in this section.
(2)
The sole purpose of a charge is to recover the reasonable costs incurred by the
local authority in respect of the activity to which the charge relates.
(3)
A particular person or particular persons should be required to pay a charge
only—
(a)
to the extent that the benefit of the local authority’s actions to which the
charge relates is obtained by those persons as distinct from the commu‐
nity of the local authority as a whole; or
(b)
where the need for the local authority’s actions to which the charge
relates results from the actions of those persons; or
(c)
in a case where the charge is in respect of the local authority’s monitor‐
ing functions under section 35(2)(a) (which relates to monitoring the
state of the whole or part of the environment),—
(i)
to the extent that the monitoring relates to the likely effects on the
environment of those persons’ activities; or
(ii)
to the extent that the likely benefit to those persons of the moni‐
toring exceeds the likely benefit of the monitoring to the commu‐
nity of the local authority as a whole.
(4)
The local authority may fix different charges for different costs it incurs in the
performance of its various functions, powers, and duties under this Act—
(a)
in relation to different areas or different classes of applicant, consent
holder, requiring authority, or heritage protection authority; or
(b)
where any activity undertaken by the persons liable to pay any charge
reduces the cost to the local authority of carrying out any of its func‐
tions, powers, and duties.
Section 36AAA: inserted, on 19 April 2017, by section 21 of the Resource Legislation Amendment
Act 2017 (2017 No 15).
36AAB Other matters relating to administrative charges
(1)
A local authority may, in any particular case and in its absolute discretion,
remit the whole or any part of any charge of a kind referred to in section 36 that
would otherwise be payable.
(2)
Where a charge of a kind referred to in section 36 is payable to a local author‐
ity, the local authority need not perform the action to which the charge relates
until the charge has been paid to it in full.

(3)
However, subsection (2) does not apply to a charge to which section
36(1)(ab)(ii), (ad)(ii), or (cb)(iv) applies (relating to independent hearings com‐
missioners requested by submitters or reviews required by a court order).
(4)
A local authority must publish and maintain, on an Internet site to which the
public has free access, an up-to-date list of charges fixed under section 36.
Section 36AAB: inserted, on 19 April 2017, by section 21 of the Resource Legislation Amendment
Act 2017 (2017 No 15).
36AA Local authority policy on discounting administrative charges
(1)
A local authority must provide a discount on an administrative charge imposed
under section 36 as follows:
(a)
a local authority that has not adopted a policy under subsection (3) must
provide a discount if regulations under section 360(1)(hj) require the
local authority to provide a discount:
(b)
a local authority that has adopted a policy under subsection (3) must pro‐
vide a discount under whichever of the policy and regulations under sec‐
tion 360(1)(hj) is more generous in the circumstances of the particular
case.
(2)
The Minister must recommend to the Governor-General within 9 months of the
commencement of section 32 of the Resource Management (Simplifying and
Streamlining) Amendment Act 2009 that regulations be made under section
360(1)(hj) and the Minister must, before making the recommendation, consult
with local authorities about the proposed regulations.
(2A) The Minister must ensure that regulations made under section 360(1)(hj)
remain in force, but this subsection does not prevent regulations made under
section 360(1)(hj) (including the regulations made in compliance with subsec‐
tion (2)) from being amended or from being revoked and replaced by another
set of regulations made under section 360(1)(hj).
(3)
A local authority may adopt, in accordance with the special consultative pro‐
cedure set out in section 83 of the Local Government Act 2002, a policy in
respect of discounting administrative charges imposed under section 36 of this
Act in the circumstances where—
(a)
an application for a resource consent or an application to change or can‐
cel conditions under section 127 is not processed within the time frames
set out in this Act; and
(b)
the responsibility for the failure rests with the local authority.
(4)
The policy must specify—
(a)
the discount, or the method for determining the discount, that would be
given for any application fees or charges paid or owing; and
(b)
the procedure an applicant must follow to obtain the discount.

Striking out submissions
(1)
An authority conducting a hearing on a matter described in section 39(1) may
direct that a submission or part of a submission be struck out if the authority is
satisfied that at least 1 of the following applies to the submission or the part:

it discloses no reasonable or relevant case:
(c)
it would be an abuse of the hearing process to allow the submission or
the part to be taken further:
(d)
it is supported only by evidence that, though purporting to be independ‐
ent expert evidence, has been prepared by a person who is not independ‐
ent or who does not have sufficient specialised knowledge or skill to
give expert evidence on the matter:
(e)
it contains offensive language.
(2)

the location of waahi tapu; or
(b)
to avoid the disclosure of a trade secret or unreasonable prejudice to the
commercial position of the person who supplied, or is the subject of, the
information,—
and, in the circumstances of the particular case, the importance of avoiding
such offence, disclosure, or prejudice outweighs the public interest in making
that information available.
(2)
A local authority may make an order for the purpose of subsection (1)—
(a)
that the whole or part of any hearing or class of hearing at which the
information is likely to be referred to, shall be held with the public

An order made under subsection (2)(b) in relation to—
(a)
any matter described in subsection (1)(a) may be expressed to have
effect from the commencement of any proceedings to which it relates

siders appropriate in the circumstances:

any matter described in subsection (1)(b) may be expressed to have
effect from the commencement of any proceedings to which it relates but
shall cease to have any effect at the conclusion of those proceedings—

Local Government Official Information and Meetings Act 1987 shall apply
accordingly in respect of any information that was the subject of any such
order.
(4)
Any party to any proceedings or class of proceedings before a local authority
may apply to the Environment Court for an order under section 279(3)(a) can‐
celling or varying any order made by the local authority under this section.

Regional coastal plan not to authorise aquaculture activities in coastal
marine area as permitted activities
(1)
Despite section 68, after the commencement of section 17 of the Resource
Management Amendment Act (No 2) 2011 no rule may be included in a
regional coastal plan which authorises as a permitted activity any aquaculture
activity in the coastal marine area.
(2)
If, immediately before the commencement of section 17 of the Resource Man‐
agement Amendment Act (No 2) 2011, a regional coastal plan contains a rule
that authorises as a permitted activity any part of an aquaculture activity in the
coastal marine area—
(a)
any person may act, or continue to act, in accordance with the rule until
any alteration of the rule has legal effect; but
(b)
a regional council must, as soon as is reasonably practicable and not
later than 2 years after the commencement of section 17 of the Resource
Management Amendment Act (No 2) 2011, initiate a review of the rule
under section 79 and propose to alter any provisions necessary to ensure
compliance with subsection (1), in the manner set out in Part 1 of Sched‐
ule 1 and this Part.

Rules relating to water quality
(1)
Where a regional council—
(a)
provides in a plan that certain waters are to be managed for any purpose
described in respect of any of the classes specified in Schedule 3; and
(b)
includes rules in the plan about the quality of water in those waters,—
the rules shall require the observance of the standards specified in that schedule
in respect of the appropriate class or classes unless, in the council’s opinion,
those standards are not adequate or appropriate in respect of those waters in
which case the rules may state standards that are more stringent or specific.
(2)
Where a regional council provides in a plan that certain waters are to be man‐
aged for any purpose for which the classes specified in Schedule 3 are not
adequate or appropriate, the council may state in the plan new classes and
standards about the quality of water in those waters.
(3)
Subject to the need to allow for reasonable mixing of a discharged contaminant
or water, a regional council shall not set standards in a plan which result, or
may result, in a reduction of the quality of the water in any waters at the time
of the public notification of the proposed plan unless it is consistent with the
purpose of this Act to do so.

Rules about discharges
(1)
Before a regional council includes in a regional plan a rule that allows as a per‐
mitted activity—
(a)
a discharge of a contaminant or water into water; or
(b)
a discharge of a contaminant onto or into land in circumstances which
may result in that contaminant (or any other contaminant emanating as a
result of natural processes from that contaminant) entering water,—
the regional council shall be satisfied that none of the following effects are
likely to arise in the receiving waters, after reasonable mixing, as a result of the
discharge of the contaminant (either by itself or in combination with the same,
similar, or other contaminants):
(c)
the production of conspicuous oil or grease films, scums or foams, or
floatable or suspended materials:
(d)
any conspicuous change in the colour or visual clarity:
(e)
any emission of objectionable odour:
(f)
the rendering of fresh water unsuitable for consumption by farm ani‐
mals:
(g)
any significant adverse effects on aquatic life.
(2)
Before a regional council includes in a regional plan a rule requiring the adop‐
tion of the best practicable option to prevent or minimise any actual or likely
adverse effect on the environment of any discharge of a contaminant, the
regional council shall be satisfied that, having regard to—
(a)
the nature of the discharge and the receiving environment; and
(b)
other alternatives, including a rule requiring the observance of minimum
standards of quality of the environment,—
the inclusion of that rule in the plan is the most efficient and effective means of
preventing or minimising those adverse effects on the environment.

In carrying out its functions under this section, a specified territorial authority
may create new residential zones or amend existing residential zones.

A specified territorial authority—
(a)
must include the objectives and policies set out in clause 6 of Schedule
3A:

may include objectives and policies in addition to those set out in clause
6 of Schedule 3A, to—
(i)
provide for matters of discretion to support the MDRS; and

torial authority has chosen to modify the MDRS in accordance
with section 77H.
(6)

3A or policy 3 less enabling of development than provided for in that schedule
or by policy 3, if authorised to do so under section 77I.
(7)

3A:
(b)
including rules that regulate the same effect as a density standard set out
in Part 2 of Schedule 3A, but that are more lenient than provided for by
the MDRS.
(2)
To avoid doubt, more lenient means the rule (including a requirement, condi‐
tion, or permission) permits an activity that the MDRS would restrict.
(3)
A specified territorial authority is considered to have met its obligations under
section 77G(1) by acting in accordance with subsection (1) of this section.
(4)
A specified territorial authority may choose not to incorporate 1 or more den‐

that the qualifying matter is incompatible with the level of devel‐
opment permitted by the MDRS (as specified in Schedule 3A) or
as provided for by policy 3 for that area; and
(b)
assess the impact that limiting development capacity, building height, or
density (as relevant) will have on the provision of development capacity;
and

development areas, including—
(i)
any operative district plan spatial layers; and
(ii)
any new spatial layers proposed for the district plan.
(5)
The requirements set out in subsection (3)(a) apply only in the area for which
the territorial authority is proposing to make an allowance for a qualifying

Boundary adjustments
(1)
Where the boundaries of any region or district are altered, and any area comes
within the jurisdiction of a different local authority,—
(a)
the plan or proposed plan that applied to the area before the alteration of
the boundaries shall continue to apply to that area and shall, in so far as
it applies to the area, be deemed to be part of the plan or proposed plan
of the different local authority:
(b)
any activity that may, before the alteration of the boundaries, have been
undertaken under section 19 may continue to be undertaken as if the
alteration of the boundaries had not taken place.
(2)
Where the boundaries of any district are altered so as to include within that dis‐
trict any area not previously within the boundaries of any other district, no per‐
son may use that land unless expressly allowed by a resource consent, until a
district plan provides otherwise.
(3)
A territorial authority shall, as soon as practicable but within 2 years, make
such changes to its district plans as it considers necessary to cover any area that
comes within its jurisdiction, and, after the changes are made, this section shall
cease to apply.
Section 81(1)(b): amended, on 1 August 2003, by section 95 of the Resource Management Amend‐
ment Act 2003 (2003 No 23).

Disputes
(1)
Subsection (2) applies if there is a dispute about—
(a)
whether there is an inconsistency between a water conservation order
and a regional policy statement or a plan; or
(b)
whether there is an inconsistency between a regional policy statement or
a regional plan and a district plan (including any rules of a plan) on a
matter of regional significance; or
(c)
whether a regional policy statement or a plan gives effect to a national
policy statement or New Zealand coastal policy statement or a national
planning standard.
(2)
A Minister or local authority responsible for a relevant national policy state‐
ment, New Zealand coastal policy statement, a national planning standard, pol‐
icy statement, plan, or order may refer a dispute to the Environment Court for a
decision resolving the matter.
Part 5 s 81
Resource Management Act 1991
Version as at
13 March 2025
234

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3)
If a dispute about whether there is an inconsistency described in subsection
(1)(a) or (b) is referred to the court, and the court considers that there is an
inconsistency, the court must order the authority responsible for the policy
statement or plan to remove the inconsistency by initiating a change to the pol‐
icy statement or plan using the process in Schedule 1.
(4)
If a dispute about whether a regional policy statement or a plan gives effect to a
national policy statement or New Zealand coastal policy statement or a national
planning standard is referred to the court, and the court considers that the pol‐
icy statement or plan does not give effect to the other policy statement or a
national planning standard, the court must order the authority responsible for
the policy statement or plan to amend it in accordance with section 55 or 58I.
(5)
However, the court does not need to make an order under subsection (3) or (4)
if it considers that the inconsistency, or failure to give effect to the other policy
statement or a national planning standard, is of minor significance that does not
affect the general intent and purpose of the policy statement, national planning
standard, plan, or water conservation order concerned.
(6)
To avoid doubt, giving effect to a policy statement includes giving effect to it
by complying with a direction described in section 55(2), and giving effect to
the national planning standard includes giving effect to it by complying with
section 58I(2).

Environment Court may give directions in respect of land subject to
controls
(1)
An interest in land shall be deemed not to be taken or injuriously affected by
reason of any provision in a plan unless otherwise provided for in this Act.
(2)
Notwithstanding subsection (1), any person having an interest in land to which
any provision or proposed provision of a plan or proposed plan applies, and
who considers that the provision or proposed provision would render that inter‐
est in land incapable of reasonable use, may challenge that provision or pro‐
posed provision on those grounds—

change to a plan; or
(b)
in an application to change a plan made under clause 21 of Schedule 1.

(a)
in the case of a plan or proposed plan (other than a regional coastal plan

ever of the following the local authority considers appropriate:
(i)
modify, delete, or replace the provision in the plan or proposed
plan in the manner directed by the court:
(ii)
acquire all or part of the estate or interest in the land under the

makes any land incapable of reasonable use; and
(b)
places an unfair and unreasonable burden on any person who has an
interest in the land.
(3C) Before exercising its jurisdiction under subsection (3A), the Environment
Court must have regard to—
(a)
Part 3 (including the effect of section 9(3); and

the person with the estate or interest in the land or part of the land con‐
cerned (or the spouse, civil union partner, or de facto partner of that per‐
son)—
(i)
had acquired the estate or interest in the land or part of it before
the date on which the provision or proposed provision was first
notified or otherwise included in the relevant plan or proposed
plan; and
(ii)
the provision or proposed provision remained in substantially the
same form; and
(b)
the person with the estate or interest in the land or part of the land con‐
sents to the giving of the direction.

(a)
subsection (3) or section 86BA applies; or

the Environment Court, in accordance with section 86D, orders the rule
to have legal effect from a different date (being the date specified in the
court order); or
(c)
the local authority concerned resolves that the rule has legal effect only
once the proposed plan becomes operative in accordance with clause 20

(c)
the decision is not subsequently rescinded (in which case the rule has

86BA Immediate legal effect of rules in IPI prepared using ISPP
Immediate legal effect: general
(1)
A rule in a proposed plan has immediate legal effect if the rule meets all of the
following criteria:
(a)
the rule is in an IPI prepared using the ISPP:
(b)
the rule authorises as a permitted activity a residential unit in a relevant
residential zone in accordance with the density standards set out in Part 2

(2)
If a rule in a district plan (rule A) is inconsistent with a rule to which subsec‐
tion (1) applies (rule B),—
(a)
rule A ceases to have legal effect from the time at which rule B has
immediate legal effect; and
(b)
rule A is no longer to be treated as an operative provision of the district
plan.
More lenient density standards
(3)
Subsection (4) applies if a rule in a proposed plan—
(a)
meets the criteria specified in subsection (1)(a) and (c); and
(b)
would meet the criterion specified in subsection (1)(b) but for the fact
that it includes a proposed density standard that—
(i)
regulates the same effect as a density standard set out in Part 2 of
Schedule 3A; and
(ii)
is proposed, in accordance with section 77H(1)(b), to be more
lenient than provided for by the MDRS.
(4)
If this subsection applies,—
(a)
the proposed density standard does not have immediate legal effect; but
(b)
all other density standards referred to in subsection (1)(b) have immedi‐
ate legal effect and subsection (2) applies to those standards as if they
were rule B.
Omitted or additional density standards
(5)
Subsection (6) applies if—
(a)
the rule referred to in subsection (1)—
(i)
omits, in accordance with section 77H(1)(a), a density standard
set out in Part 2 of Schedule 3A; or
(ii)
includes an additional requirement, condition, or permission regu‐
lating an effect other than those set out in Part 2 of Schedule 3A;
and
(b)
the omitted density standard, or the additional requirement, condition, or
permission, regulates the same effect as a rule (including a density stand‐
ard, requirement, condition, or permission) in the operative plan (the
operative rule).
(6)
If this subsection applies, the operative rule continues to have legal effect until
the date on which the proposed plan becomes operative.
Interpretation

In this section,
more lenient has the same meaning as in section 77H(2)

that requires consent under a district plan (other than a subdivision of
land); and
(b)
includes an address for service that is an electronic address.
(2)
An application described in subsection (1) ceases to be a fast-track application
if—
(a)
a consent authority gives public or limited notification of the application;
or

a hearing is to be held for the application; or
(c)
at the time the application is lodged, the applicant notifies the consent
authority that the applicant wishes to opt out of the fast track process.

To avoid doubt, if an application ceases to be a fast-track application under
subsection (2)(a) or (b),—
(a)
the application is not incomplete by reason only that it does not include
the information referred to in section 88(2)(c); but
(b)

vide any of the information referred to in section 88(2)(c).
(4)
To avoid doubt, when an application ceases to be a fast-track application,—

the application becomes subject to the standard processing requirements
(including any time periods for doing anything) under this Act that
would have applied if the application had not been a fast-track applica‐
tion; and
(b)
those time periods are deemed to have been running from the time they
would have begun if this section had not applied and are not reset as
from the time the application ceases to be fast-track.

Restriction on grant of certain discharge permits
(1)
Except as provided in subsection (2) or (2A), a consent authority shall not grant
a discharge permit or a coastal permit to do something that would otherwise
contravene section 15 or section 15A allowing—
(a)
the discharge of a contaminant or water into water; or
(b)
a discharge of a contaminant onto or into land in circumstances which
may result in that contaminant (or any other contaminant emanating as a
result of natural processes from that contaminant) entering water; or
(ba)
the dumping in the coastal marine area from any ship, aircraft, or off‐
shore installation of any waste or other matter that is a contaminant,—
if, after reasonable mixing, the contaminant or water discharged (either by
itself or in combination with the same, similar, or other contaminants or water),
is likely to give rise to all or any of the following effects in the receiving
waters:
(c)
the production of any conspicuous oil or grease films, scums or foams,
or floatable or suspended materials:
(d)
any conspicuous change in the colour or visual clarity:

(e)
any emission of objectionable odour:
(f)
the rendering of fresh water unsuitable for consumption by farm ani‐
mals:
(g)
any significant adverse effects on aquatic life.
(2)
A consent authority may grant a discharge permit or a coastal permit to do
something that would otherwise contravene section 15 or section 15A that may
allow any of the effects described in subsection (1) if it is satisfied—
(a)
that exceptional circumstances justify the granting of the permit; or
(b)
that the discharge is of a temporary nature; or
(c)
that the discharge is associated with necessary maintenance work—
and that it is consistent with the purpose of this Act to do so.
(2A) A consent authority may grant a discharge permit or a coastal permit to do
something that would otherwise contravene section 15 or 15A that may allow
the effects described in subsection (1)(g) if the consent authority—
(a)
is satisfied that, at the time of granting, there are already effects
described in subsection (1)(g) in the receiving waters; and
(b)
imposes conditions on the permit; and
(c)
is satisfied that those conditions will contribute to a reduction of the
effects described in subsection (1)(g) over the duration of the permit.
(3)
In addition to any other conditions imposed under this Act, a discharge permit
or coastal permit may include conditions requiring the holder of the permit to
undertake such works in such stages throughout the term of the permit as will
ensure that upon the expiry of the permit the holder can meet the requirements
of subsection (1) and of any relevant regional rules.

(1)
A consent authority may, in accordance with section 129, serve notice on a
consent holder of its intention to review the conditions of a resource consent—
(a)
at any time or times specified for that purpose in the consent for any of
the following purposes:
(i)
to deal with any adverse effect on the environment which may
arise from the exercise of the consent and which it is appropriate
to deal with at a later stage; or
(ii)
to require a holder of a discharge permit or a coastal permit to do
something that would otherwise contravene section 15 or 15B to
adopt the best practicable option to remove or reduce any adverse
effect on the environment; or
(iii)
for any other purpose specified in the consent; or
(b)
in the case of a coastal, water, or discharge permit, or a land use consent
granted by a regional council, if—
(i)
a regional plan contains a rule that relates to maximum or min‐
imum levels or flows or rates of use of water, or minimum stand‐
ards of water quality or air quality, or ranges of temperature or
pressure of geothermal water; and
(ii)
the rule has been made operative; and
Version as at

(iii)
the regional council considers that it is appropriate to review the
conditions of the permit or consent in order to enable the levels,
flows, rates, or standards set by the rule to be met; or
(ba)
in the case of a coastal, water, or discharge permit, or a land use consent
granted by a regional council, when relevant national environmental
standards or national planning standards have been made; or
(bb)
in the case of a land use consent, in relation to a relevant regional rule;
or
(c)
if the information made available to the consent authority by the appli‐
cant for the consent for the purposes of the application contained inac‐
curacies which materially influenced the decision made on the applica‐
tion and the effects of the exercise of the consent are such that it is
necessary to apply more appropriate conditions; or
(d)
if the review is part of a review carried out under subsection (2A).
(2)
A consent authority must, in accordance with section 129, serve notice on a
consent holder of its intention to review the conditions of a resource consent if
required by an order made under section 339(5)(b).
(2A) If more than 1 resource consent is affected by the rule referred to in subsection
(1)(b)(i), the consent authority may review the conditions of those resource
consents together for the purpose of managing the effects of the activities car‐
ried out under those resource consents.
(3)
A regional council must notify the chief executive of the Ministry of Fisheries
as soon as is reasonably practicable if it intends to review a condition of a
coastal permit authorising an aquaculture activity to be undertaken in the
coastal marine area and the condition has been specified under section
186H(1A) of the Fisheries Act 1996 as a condition that may not be changed or
cancelled until the chief executive of the Ministry of Fisheries makes a further

Matters to be considered in review
(1)

(a)
shall have regard to the matters in section 104 and to whether the activ‐
ity allowed by the consent will continue to be viable after the change;
and
(aa)

reasons that the court provided for making the order requiring the
review; and
(b)
may have regard to the manner in which the consent has been used.
(2)
Before changing the conditions of a discharge permit or a coastal permit to do
something that would otherwise contravene section 15 (relating to the dis‐
charge of contaminants) or 15B to include a condition requiring the holder to
adopt the best practicable option to remove or reduce any adverse effect on the
environment, the consent authority shall be satisfied, in the particular circum‐
stances and having regard to—
(a)
the nature of the discharge and the receiving environment; and
(b)
the financial implications for the applicant of including that condition;
and

(c)
other alternatives, including a condition requiring the observance of min‐
imum standards of quality of the receiving environment—
that including that condition is the most efficient and effective means of remov‐
ing or reducing that adverse effect.

cation; and
(c)

138A Special provisions relating to coastal permits for dumping and
incineration
(1)
Without limiting section 104, when considering an application for a coastal
permit to do something that would otherwise contravene section 15A(1), the
consent authority shall, in having regard to the actual and potential effects of
allowing the activity, have regard to—
(a)
the nature of any discharge of any contaminant which the dumping or
incineration may involve and the sensitivity of the receiving environ‐
ment to adverse effects and the applicant’s reasons for making the pro‐
posed choice; and
(b)
any possible alternative methods of disposal or combustion including
any involving discharge into any other receiving environment,—
and, without limiting the powers of the consent authority under section 92, it
may, at any reasonable time before the hearing (or, if there is no hearing, the
determination) of the application, by written notice to the applicant, require the
applicant to provide, by way of further information, an explanation of those
matters.
(2)
Without limiting section 108, but subject to subsection (5), a coastal permit to
which subsection (1) applies may include a condition requiring the holder to
adopt the best practicable option to prevent or minimise any actual or likely
adverse effect on the environment of any discharge of any contaminant which
may occur in the exercise of the permit; provided that before a consent author‐
ity decides to grant a coastal permit subject to such a condition, it shall be satis‐
fied that, in the particular circumstances, and having regard to—
(a)
the nature of any discharge of a contaminant and the receiving environ‐
ment; and
(b)
other alternatives, including any condition requiring the observance of
minimum standards of quality of the receiving environment,—
the inclusion of the condition is the most efficient and effective means of pre‐
venting or minimising any actual or likely adverse effect on the environment.
(3)
In respect of a coastal permit to do something that would otherwise contravene
section 15A(1), a consent authority may, at any time specified for that purpose
in the permit, in accordance with section 129, serve notice on the holder of the
permit of its intention to review the conditions of the permit for the purpose of
requiring the holder to adopt the best practicable option to remove or reduce
any adverse effect on the environment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(4)
Subject to subsection (5), sections 129 to 133 shall apply to any review of a
coastal permit under subsection (3) and the powers conferred on a consent
authority by that subsection are in addition to the powers conferred by section
128.
(5)
Before deciding to grant a coastal permit subject to a condition described in
subsection (2) and before deciding to change the conditions of a coastal permit
pursuant to subsections (3) and (4), the consent authority shall be satisfied, in
the particular circumstances, and having regard to—
(a)
the nature of any discharge of a contaminant and the receiving environ‐
ment; and
(b)
the financial implications for the holder of including that condition; and
(c)
other alternatives, including a condition requiring the observance of min‐
imum standards of quality of the receiving environment—
that including a condition in the permit requiring the holder to adopt the best
practicable option to remove or reduce any adverse effect on the environment
is the most efficient and effective means of removing or reducing that adverse
effect.
(6)
In every coastal permit to do something that would otherwise contravene sec‐
tion 15A(1), there shall be implied a condition that the holder shall, in the pre‐
scribed form and at the cost of the holder in all respects, keep such records and
furnish to the Director of Maritime New Zealand such information and returns
as may from time to time be required by regulations.

Outline of this Part
(1)
This section sets out the general scheme and effect of this Part. This section is
by way of explanation only and does not limit or affect the other provisions of
this Part or this Act.

Resource Management Act 1991
Part 6AA s 140

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2)
This Part provides the Minister with specific powers in relation to applications
for resource consents, applications for changes to or cancellation of resource
consent conditions, local authority plan changes or variations, requests for plan
changes, requests for the preparation of regional plans, matters relating to
regional policy statements, and notices of requirement that are or are part of a
proposal of national significance.
(3)
If exercised by the Minister, these powers set in motion one of 2 procedures by
which the application, change, variation, request, or notice (the matter) is
decided. Instead of the normal procedures set out in the Act, either a board of
inquiry or the Environment Court decides the matter. A decision by a board of
inquiry or the Environment Court may be challenged only by an appeal to the
High Court on a question of law. If that decision is challenged, a further appeal
may be taken to the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal on a question of
law, but only with the leave of the Supreme Court.
(4)
There are 3 ways in which a matter may come to the Minister for his or her
decision on whether to make a direction to refer a matter to a board of inquiry
or the Environment Court for decision. If the matter has been lodged with a
local authority, the Minister may decide to make a direction on his or her own
initiative or in response to a request from the local authority or the applicant. If
the matter has been lodged with the Environmental Protection Authority, the
Minister may decide to make a direction after receiving a recommendation
from the EPA.
(5)
If the Minister decides not to make a direction to refer a matter to a board of
inquiry or the Environment Court for decision, the matter will be processed by
the local authority that, in the normal course of the Act, would be responsible
for dealing with it. However, the Minister may still intervene in the process, for
example, by making a submission on the matter for the Crown, appointing a
project co-ordinator to advise the local authority on any thing relating to the
matter, or appointing an additional hearings commissioner.

(c)
the heritage order or requirement renders or will render the land in
respect of which it applies, incapable of reasonable use,—

Before making an order under subsection (1), the court may direct the owner to
take further action to try to sell the estate or interest in the land.

order or requirement for the purposes of section 17 of the Public Works Act
1981.

Where subsection (3) applies in respect of a heritage protection authority that is
neither the Crown nor a local authority—

ter for Land Information on behalf of the heritage protection authority as
if the land were required for a government work; and

be taken under this section shall be assessed as if the heritage order or require‐
ment had not been made.

Resource Management Act 1991
Part 9A s 217L
521

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a)
relates to an activity carried out on the farm (an activity) even if there is
no similar requirement relating to that activity in a provision of a speci‐
fied instrument:

necessary in order to avoid, remedy, or mitigate any actual or likely
adverse effect on the environment relating to any land of which the per‐
son is the owner or occupier:

change or cancel a resource consent if, in the opinion of the court, the
information made available to the consent authority by the applicant
contained inaccuracies relevant to the enforcement order sought which
materially influenced the decision to grant the consent:

costs of investigation, supervision, and monitoring of the adverse effect on the
environment, and the costs of any actions required to avoid, remedy, or miti‐
gate the adverse effect.

such terms and conditions as the Environment Court thinks fit (including the

sentatives, successors, and assigns of a person to the same extent as it applies

Provisions deemed to be regional rules
(1)
A provision that is deemed by section 368(1) to be a provision of a regional
plan and that, expressly or by implication and whether or not subject to condi‐
tions,—
(a)
authorises anything without further consent or approval being required
from any person under any enactment, regulation, or order referred to in
Schedules 6, 7, or 8, is deemed to be a regional rule in respect of a per‐
mitted activity; or
(b)
authorises anything if the consent or approval of any person is obtained
from any person under any enactment, regulation, or order referred to in
Schedules 6, 7, or 8, is deemed to be a regional rule in respect of a dis‐
cretionary activity; or
(c)
prohibits anything, or provides that it is an offence to do or omit to do
anything, is deemed to be a regional rule having the effect of making an
activity to which that act or omission relates a non-complying activity—
and the provisions of this Act shall apply accordingly.
(2)
Notwithstanding subsection (1), a bylaw shall be deemed by subsection (1) to
be a regional rule only if the regional council for the region concerned has pub‐
licly notified the relevant plan in accordance with section 376.
(3)
Where provisions of a final water classification of the kind referred to in sec‐
tion 368(2)(b) are deemed to constitute provisions of a regional plan under sec‐
tion 368(1), the plan shall be deemed to include a regional rule requiring the
Part 15 s 369
Resource Management Act 1991
Version as at
13 March 2025
684

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
minimum standards of water quality referred to in the classification to be main‐
tained after reasonable mixing and a provision that the objective of that rule is
to promote in the public interest the conservation and the best use of that water.
(4)
A consent authority may grant a discharge permit, or a coastal permit to do
something that would otherwise contravene section 15, that does not meet the
minimum standards of water quality as required by the regional rule under sub‐
section (3) if it is satisfied—
(a)
that exceptional circumstances justify the granting of the permit; or
(b)
the discharge is of a temporary nature; or
(c)
the discharge is associated with necessary maintenance work—
and that it is consistent with the purpose of this Act to do so.
(5)
Without limiting section 113, where, in accordance with subsection (4), a con‐
sent authority grants a discharge permit that does not meet the minimum stand‐
ards of water quality as required by a regional rule pursuant to subsection (3),
the consent authority shall include in its decision its reasons for granting the
permit.
(6)
In addition to any other conditions imposed under this Act, a permit granted
pursuant to subsection (4)(a) or (b) shall include conditions requiring the
holder of the permit to undertake such works in such stages throughout the
term of the permit as will ensure that upon the expiry of the permit the holder
can meet the requirements of section 107(1) and of any relevant regional rules.
(7)
Where provisions of an authorisation of the kind referred to in section
368(2)(d) are deemed to constitute provisions of a regional plan under section
368(1) and the authorisation authorises the damming of a river or stream, or
rivers or streams within any specified area, the plan shall be deemed to include
a regional rule to the effect that such an activity is a permitted activity, but no
person shall exercise the rights conferred by any such authorisation so as to
adversely affect any land owned or occupied by another person, without that

that Act had not been repealed; and
(b)
those permits were still current mining privileges under that Act; and
(c)
every reference to the Board were a reference to the appropriate regional
council.
(5)
Notwithstanding section 122, every deemed permit shall be deemed to be a
chattel interest in land and—
(a)
subject to sections 136 and 137, may be sold, encumbered, transmitted,
seized under writ of execution or warrant, or otherwise disposed of, as
fully as a chattel interest in land; but
(b)
no dealing or disposition of a kind referred to in paragraph (a) shall have
effect until written notice of the dealing or disposition is received by the
appropriate regional council.
(6)
No enforcement order may be made under section 319 against the holder of

of a deemed permit may take place except upon an application made
under section 136(4); and
(b)

or part transferred shall be deemed to be a new permit granted under this
Act, and—
(i)

would have on the relative priority and entitlement to water in the catch‐
ment and may modify the priority or other conditions of the transferred
deemed permit; and
(d)
for the purposes of this subsection, the term transfer, in relation to the
whole or part of a deemed permit, means transfer in accordance with
section 136 to another person on another site, or to another site, and the
terms transferred and transferable, where they appear in this subsec‐
tion, have a corresponding meaning.

notwithstanding any other provisions of this Act; and

the plan including the rule becomes operative and ends with the date on which
the deemed permit would have expired if it were not surrendered, which end
date shall be specified in the plan.

Permits over land other than that of holders to be produced in Land
Transfer Office
(1)
Where, immediately before the date of commencement of this Act, a mining
privilege that is deemed to be a permit under section 413(1)(e) conferred on its
holder rights over land in respect of which the holder is not the owner, then the
holder of the deemed permit—
(a)
may continue to exercise those rights, and the provisions of this section
shall apply accordingly; and
(b)
may, at any time, obtain from the relevant regional council, for the pur‐
pose of registration against any record of title under the Land Transfer
Act 2017, a certificate specifying the rights that the holder of that permit
has in respect of that land by virtue of paragraph (a).

have affixed to it the common seal of the consent authority; and
(b)

have endorsed on the certificate or refer to a diagram or plan attached to
the certificate (which need not be a survey plan), showing the course of
any race and, as the case may be, the site of any dam and the boundaries
of any part of the land which the permit specifies as being affected
except that, where it is not practicable to show the true course or site or
part of the land, it shall be indicated as nearly as possible, and, until the
contrary is proved, the course or site or part of the land so indicated shall
be deemed to be the true course, site, or boundaries, as the case may be.
(3)
No action shall lie against the Crown under subpart 3 of Part 2 of the Land
Transfer Act 2017 by reason of any certificate registered under this section not
indicating the true course of any race, the site of any dam, or boundary of any
part of the land.
(4)
Every such certificate shall be deemed—
(a)
to be an instrument capable of registration under the Land Transfer Act
2017 and, when so registered, to create in favour of the permit holder an
interest in the land in respect of which it is registered, within the mean‐
ing of section 51 of that Act; and

(b)
when so registered, to be binding on any registered owner of an estate in
fee simple or leasehold or on any registered licensee, and on any subse‐
quent mortgagee of any land, or of any interest in any land, affected by
the certificate notwithstanding the expiration, lapsing, cancellation, sur‐
render, suspension, or transfer of the deemed permit to which it relates.
(5)
Without limiting subsection (1), any certificate registered under this section
may be transferred by the holder of the deemed permit, or any permit issued in
substitution for it, to the person to whom such permit is transferred, by means
of a transfer instrument to be registered under the provisions of the Land Trans‐
fer Act 2017.
(6)
Where any certificate is produced to the Registrar-General of Land under this
section, the Registrar-General of Land shall enter on every record of title, lease,
licence to occupy, provisional register, or other instrument of title registered or
filed in the Registrar-General of Land’s office and relating to that land, the par‐
ticulars of the deemed permit, including the file reference.
(7)
Nothing in the Land Transfer Act 2017 shall limit or affect any right, title, or
interest held under a deemed permit over land of which the holder of the permit
is not the owner before the certificate has been registered and particulars have
been entered by the Registrar-General of Land on the instrument of title
affected in accordance with subsection (6).
(8)
If the land affected by subsection (1) or any part of it is not subject to the Land
Transfer Act 2017, and dealings with the land or part not so subject are not reg‐
isterable under the Deeds Registration Act 1908, the person in whose favour
the right continues may at any time obtain from the relevant regional council a
certificate in terms of subsections (1) and (2), and may lodge a true copy of the
certificate in the office of the Chief Surveyor; and the Chief Surveyor shall
note the existence of the certificate on the proper plans and records of the land
district.
