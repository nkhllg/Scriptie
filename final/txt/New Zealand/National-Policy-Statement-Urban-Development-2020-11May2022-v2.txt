National Policy Statement on Urban Development 2020 – updated May 2022  
Part 2: Objectives and policies 
2.1 
Objectives 
Objective 1: New Zealand has well-functioning urban environments that enable all people and 
communities to provide for their social, economic, and cultural wellbeing, and for their health 
and safety, now and into the future. 
Objective 2: Planning decisions improve housing affordability by supporting competitive land 
and development markets. 
Objective 3: Regional policy statements and district plans enable more people to live in, and 
more businesses and community services to be located in, areas of an urban environment in 
which one or more of the following apply: 
 
the area is in or near a centre zone or other area with many employment 
opportunities 
 
the area is well-serviced by existing or planned public transport  
 
there is high demand for housing or for business land in the area, relative 
to other areas within the urban environment.  
Objective 4: New Zealand’s urban environments, including their amenity values, develop 
and change over time in response to the diverse and changing needs of people, communities, 
and future generations. 
Objective 5: Planning decisions relating to urban environments, and FDSs, take into 
account the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi (Te Tiriti o Waitangi). 
Objective 6: Local authority decisions on urban development that affect urban 
environments are: 
 
integrated with infrastructure planning and funding decisions; and 
 
strategic over the medium term and long term; and 
 
responsive, particularly in relation to proposals that would supply significant 
development capacity. 
Objective 7: Local authorities have robust and frequently updated information about their 
urban environments and use it to inform planning decisions. 
Objective 8: New Zealand’s urban environments: 
 
support reductions in greenhouse gas emissions; and 
 
are resilient to the current and future effects of climate change. 
2.2 
Policies 
Policy 1: Planning decisions contribute to well-functioning urban environments, which are 
urban environments that, as a minimum: 
 
have or enable a variety of homes that: 
(i) 
meet the needs, in terms of type, price, and location, of different 
households; and 
(ii) 
enable Māori to express their cultural traditions and norms; and 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
National Policy Statement on Urban Development 2020 – updated May 2022 
11 
 
have or enable a variety of sites that are suitable for different business sectors 
in terms of location and site size; and 
 
have good accessibility for all people between housing, jobs, community 
services, natural spaces, and open spaces, including by way of public or active 
transport; and 
 
support, and limit as much as possible adverse impacts on, the competitive 
operation of land and development markets; and 
 
support reductions in greenhouse gas emissions; and 
 
are resilient to the likely current and future effects of climate change. 
Policy 2: Tier 1, 2, and 3 local authorities, at all times, provide at least sufficient development 
capacity to meet expected demand for housing and for business land over the short term, 
medium term, and long term.  
Policy 3: In relation to tier 1 urban environments, regional policy statements and district 
plans enable: 
 
in city centre zones, building heights and density of urban form to realise as much 
development capacity as possible, to maximise benefits of intensification; and 
 
in metropolitan centre zones, building heights and density of urban form to reflect 
demand for housing and business use in those locations, and in all cases building 
heights of at least 6 storeys; and 
 
building heights of at least 6 storeys within at least a walkable catchment of the 
following: 
(i) 
existing and planned rapid transit stops 
(ii) 
the edge of city centre zones 
(iii) 
the edge of metropolitan centre zones; and 
 
within and adjacent to neighbourhood centre zones, local centre zones, and town 
centre zones (or equivalent), building heights and densities of urban form 
commensurate with the level of commercial activity and community services. 
Policy 4: Regional policy statements and district plans applying to tier 1 urban environments 
modify the relevant building height or density requirements under Policy 3 only to the extent 
necessary (as specified in subpart 6) to accommodate a qualifying matter in that area.  
Policy 5: Regional policy statements and district plans applying to tier 2 and 3 urban 
environments enable heights and density of urban form commensurate with the greater of:  
 
the level of accessibility by existing or planned active or public transport to a 
range of commercial activities and community services; or 
 
relative demand for housing and business use in that location. 
Policy 6: When making planning decisions that affect urban environments, decision-makers 
have particular regard to the following matters: 
 
the planned urban built form anticipated by those RMA planning documents that 
have given effect to this National Policy Statement  
 
that the planned urban built form in those RMA planning documents may involve 
significant changes to an area, and those changes: 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
12 
National Policy Statement on Urban Development 2020 – updated May 2022  
(i) 
may detract from amenity values appreciated by some people but improve 
amenity values appreciated by other people, communities, and future 
generations, including by providing increased and varied housing densities 
and types; and 
(ii) 
are not, of themselves, an adverse effect 
 
the benefits of urban development that are consistent with well-functioning 
urban environments (as described in Policy 1) 
 
any relevant contribution that will be made to meeting the requirements of this 
National Policy Statement to provide or realise development capacity 
 
the likely current and future effects of climate change. 
Policy 7: Tier 1 and 2 local authorities set housing bottom lines for the short-medium term and 
the long term in their regional policy statements and district plans. 
Policy 8: Local authority decisions affecting urban environments are responsive to plan 
changes that would add significantly to development capacity and contribute to well-
functioning urban environments, even if the development capacity is:  
 
unanticipated by RMA planning documents; or 
 
out-of-sequence with planned land release. 
Policy 9: Local authorities, in taking account of the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi 
(Te Tiriti o Waitangi) in relation to urban environments, must: 
 
involve hapū and iwi in the preparation of RMA planning documents and any 
FDSs by undertaking effective consultation that is early, meaningful and, as far 
as practicable, in accordance with tikanga Māori; and 
 
when preparing RMA planning documents and FDSs, take into account the 
values and aspirations of hapū and iwi for urban development; and 
 
provide opportunities in appropriate circumstances for Māori involvement in 
decision-making on resource consents, designations, heritage orders, and water 
conservation orders, including in relation to sites of significance to Māori and 
issues of cultural significance; and 
 
operate in a way that is consistent with iwi participation legislation. 
Policy 10: Tier 1, 2, and 3 local authorities: 
 
that share jurisdiction over urban environments work together when 
implementing this National Policy Statement; and 
 
engage with providers of development infrastructure and additional infrastructure 
to achieve integrated land use and infrastructure planning; and 
 
engage with the development sector to identify significant opportunities for 
urban development. 
Policy 11: In relation to car parking: 
 
the district plans of tier 1, 2, and 3 territorial authorities do not set minimum 
car parking rate requirements, other than for accessible car parks; and 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
National Policy Statement on Urban Development 2020 – updated May 2022 
13 
 
tier 1, 2, and 3 local authorities are strongly encouraged to manage effects 
associated with the supply and demand of car parking through comprehensive 
parking management plans. 
 
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
14 
National Policy Statement on Urban Development 2020 – updated May 2022  
Part 3: Implementation 
3.1 
Outline of part  
 
This part sets out a non-exhaustive list of things that local authorities must do to give 
effect to the objectives and policies of this National Policy Statement, but nothing in 
this part limits the general obligation under the Act to give effect to those objectives 
and policies.  
Subpart 1 – Providing development capacity  
3.2 
Sufficient development capacity for housing  
 
Every tier 1, 2, and 3 local authority must provide at least sufficient development 
capacity in its region or district to meet expected demand for housing: 
 
in existing and new urban areas; and 
 
for both standalone dwellings and attached dwellings; and 
 
in the short term, medium term, and long term. 
 
In order to be sufficient to meet expected demand for housing, the development 
capacity must be: 
 
plan-enabled (see clause 3.4(1)); and 
 
infrastructure-ready (see clause 3.4(3)); and 
 
feasible and reasonably expected to be realised (see clause 3.26); and 
 
for tier 1 and 2 local authorities only, meet the expected demand plus the 
appropriate competitiveness margin (see clause 3.22).  
3.3 
Sufficient development capacity for business land 
 
Every tier 1, 2, and 3 local authority must provide at least sufficient development 
capacity in its region or district to meet the expected demand for business land: 
 
from different business sectors; and 
 
in the short term, medium term, and long term. 
 
In order to be sufficient to meet expected demand for business land, the development 
capacity provided must be: 
 
plan-enabled (see clause 3.4(1)); and 
 
infrastructure-ready (see clause 3.4(3)); and 
 
suitable (as described in clause 3.29(2)) to meet the demands of different 
business sectors (as described in clause 3.28(3)); and 
 
for tier 1 and 2 local authorities only, meet the expected demand plus the 
appropriate competitiveness margin (see clause 3.22). 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
National Policy Statement on Urban Development 2020 – updated May 2022 
15 
3.4 
Meaning of plan-enabled and infrastructure-ready 
 
Development capacity is plan-enabled for housing or for business land if: 
 
in relation to the short term, it is on land that is zoned for housing or for business 
use (as applicable) in an operative district plan 
 
in relation to the medium term, either paragraph (a) applies, or it is on land that is 
zoned for housing or for business use (as applicable) in a proposed district plan 
 
in relation to the long term, either paragraph (b) applies, or it is on land identified 
by the local authority for future urban use or urban intensification in an FDS or, 
if the local authority is not required to have an FDS, any other relevant plan 
or strategy.  
 
For the purpose of subclause (1), land is zoned for housing or for business use (as 
applicable) only if the housing or business use is a permitted, controlled, or restricted 
discretionary activity on that land. 
 
Development capacity is infrastructure-ready if: 
 
in relation to the short term, there is adequate existing development 
infrastructure to support the development of the land 
 
in relation to the medium term, either paragraph (a) applies, or funding for 
adequate development infrastructure to support development of the land is 
identified in a long-term plan 
 
in relation to the long term, either paragraph (b) applies, or the development 
infrastructure to support the development capacity is identified in the local 
authority’s infrastructure strategy (as required as part of its long-term plan).  
3.5 
Availability of additional infrastructure 
 
Local authorities must be satisfied that the additional infrastructure to service the 
development capacity is likely to be available. 
3.6 
Housing bottom lines for tier 1 and 2 urban environments 
 
The purpose of the housing bottom lines required by this clause is to clearly state the 
amount of development capacity that is sufficient to meet expected housing demand 
plus the appropriate competitiveness margin in the region and each constituent district 
of a tier 1 or tier 2 urban environment.  
 
For each tier 1 or tier 2 urban environment, as soon as practicable after an HBA is made 
publicly available (see clause 3.19(1)): 
 
the relevant regional council must insert into its regional policy statement: 
(i) 
a housing bottom line for the short-medium term; and 
(ii) 
a housing bottom line for the long term; and 
 
every relevant territorial authority must insert into its district plan: 
(i) 
a housing bottom line for the short-medium term that is the proportion 
of the housing bottom line for the short-medium term (as set out in the 
relevant regional policy statement) that is attributable to the district 
of the territorial authority; and 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
16 
National Policy Statement on Urban Development 2020 – updated May 2022  
(ii) 
a housing bottom line for the long term that is the proportion of the 
housing bottom line for the long term (as set out in the relevant 
regional policy statement) that is attributable to the district of the 
territorial authority. 
 
The housing bottom lines must be based on information in the most recent publicly 
available HBA for the urban environment and are: 
 
for the short-medium term, the sum of: 
(i) 
the amount of feasible, reasonably expected to be realised development 
capacity that must be enabled to meet demand, along with the 
competitiveness margin, for the short term; and 
(ii) 
the amount of feasible, reasonably expected to be realised development 
capacity that must enabled to meet demand, along with the 
competitiveness margin, for the medium term; and 
 
for the long term, the amount of feasible, reasonably expected to be realised 
development capacity that must enabled to meet demand, along with the 
competitiveness margin, for the long term. 
 
The insertion of bottom lines must be done without using a process in Schedule 1 of the 
Act, but any changes to RMA planning documents required to give effect to the bottom 
lines must be made using a Schedule 1 process. 
3.7 
When there is insufficient development capacity 
 
If a local authority determines that there is insufficient development capacity 
(as described in clauses 3.2 and 3.3) over the short term, medium term, or long 
term, it must:  
 
immediately notify the Minister for the Environment; and 
 
if the insufficiency is wholly or partly a result of RMA planning documents, change 
those documents to increase development capacity for housing or business land 
(as applicable) as soon as practicable, and update any other relevant plan or 
strategy (including any FDS, as required by subpart 4); and 
 
consider other options for: 
(i) 
increasing development capacity; and 
(ii) 
otherwise enabling development.  
Subpart 2 – Responsive planning 
3.8 
Unanticipated or out-of-sequence developments 
 
This clause applies to a plan change that provides significant development capacity that 
is not otherwise enabled in a plan or is not in sequence with planned land release. 
 
Every local authority must have particular regard to the development capacity provided 
by the plan change if that development capacity: 
 
would contribute to a well-functioning urban environment; and 
 
is well-connected along transport corridors; and 
 
meets the criteria set under subclause (3). 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
National Policy Statement on Urban Development 2020 – updated May 2022 
17 
 
Every regional council must include criteria in its regional policy statement for 
determining what plan changes will be treated, for the purpose of implementing 
Policy 8, as adding significantly to development capacity.  
Subpart 3 – Evidence-based decision-making 
3.9 
Monitoring requirements 
 
Every tier 1, 2, and 3 local authority must monitor, quarterly, the following in relation to 
each urban environment in their region or district: 
 
the demand for dwellings 
 
the supply of dwellings 
 
prices of, and rents for, dwellings 
 
housing affordability  
 
the proportion of housing development capacity that has been realised: 
(i) 
in previously urbanised areas (such as through infill housing or 
redevelopment); and 
(ii) 
in previously undeveloped (ie, greenfield) areas 
 
available data on business land. 
 
In relation to tier 1 urban environments, tier 1 local authorities must monitor the 
proportion of development capacity that has been realised in each zone identified 
in clause 3.37(1) (ie, each zone with development outcomes that are monitored). 
 
Every tier 1, 2, and 3 local authority must publish the results of its monitoring at 
least annually.  
 
The monitoring required by this clause must relate to the relevant urban environments, 
but may apply more widely (such as, for example, where the relevant data is available 
only on a region or district-wide basis). 
 
If more than one tier 1 or tier 2 local authority has jurisdiction over a tier 1 or tier 2 
urban environment, those local authorities are jointly responsible for doing the 
monitoring required by this subpart. 
3.10 
Assessing demand and development capacity 
 
Every local authority must assess the demand for housing and for business land in 
urban environments, and the development capacity that is sufficient (as described 
in clauses 3.2 and 3.3) to meet that demand in its region or district in the short term, 
medium term, and long term.  
 
Tier 1 and tier 2 local authorities comply with subclause (1) in relation to tier 1 and 
tier 2 urban environments by preparing and publishing an HBA as required by subpart 5.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
18 
National Policy Statement on Urban Development 2020 – updated May 2022  
3.11 
Using evidence and analysis 
 
When making plans, or when changing plans in ways that affect the development 
of urban environments, local authorities must: 
 
clearly identify the resource management issues being managed; and 
 
use evidence, particularly any relevant HBAs, about land and development 
markets, and the results of the monitoring required by this National Policy 
Statement, to assess the impact of different regulatory and non-regulatory 
options for urban development and their contribution to: 
(iii) 
achieving well-functioning urban environments; and 
(iv) 
meeting the requirements to provide at least sufficient development 
capacity. 
 
Local authorities must include the matters referred to in subclause (1)(a) and (b) in 
relevant evaluation reports and further evaluation reports prepared under sections 32 
and 32AA of the Act. 
Subpart 4 – Future Development Strategy (FDS) 
3.12 
Preparation of FDS 
 
Every tier 1 and tier 2 local authority must prepare, and make publicly available an FDS 
for the tier 1 or 2 urban environment: 
 
every 6 years; and 
 
in time to inform, or at the same time as, preparation of the next long-term plan 
of each relevant local authority. 
 
The FDS must apply, at a minimum, to the relevant tier 1 and 2 urban environments 
of the local authority, but may apply to any wider area. 
 
If more than one tier 1 or tier 2 local authority has jurisdiction over a tier 1 or tier 2 
urban environment, those local authorities are jointly responsible for preparing an 
FDS as required by this subpart. 
 
If a local authority that is not a tier 1 or 2 local authority chooses to prepare an FDS, 
either alone or with any other local authority, this subpart applies as if it were a tier 1 or 
2 local authority, except that any reference to an HBA may be read as a reference to any 
other document that contains broadly equivalent information. 
 
An FDS may be prepared and published as a stand-alone document, or be treated as 
part of any other document (such as a spatial plan). 
3.13 
Purpose and content of FDS 
 
The purpose of an FDS is:  
 
to promote long-term strategic planning by setting out how a local authority 
intends to: 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
National Policy Statement on Urban Development 2020 – updated May 2022 
19 
(i) 
achieve well-functioning urban environments in its existing and future 
urban areas; and 
(ii) 
provide at least sufficient development capacity, as required by clauses 3.2 
and 3.3, over the next 30 years to meet expected demand; and 
 
assist the integration of planning decisions under the Act with infrastructure 
planning and funding decisions. 
 
Every FDS must spatially identify:  
 
the broad locations in which development capacity will be provided over the long 
term, in both existing and future urban areas, to meet the requirements of clauses 
3.2 and 3.3; and  
 
the development infrastructure and additional infrastructure required to support 
or service that development capacity, along with the general location of the 
corridors and other sites required to provide it; and 
 
any constraints on development. 
 
Every FDS must include a clear statement of hapū and iwi values and aspirations for 
urban development. 
3.14 
What FDSs are informed by 
 
Every FDS must be informed by the following:  
 
the most recent applicable HBA 
 
a consideration of the advantages and disadvantages of different spatial scenarios 
for achieving the purpose of the FDS 
 
the relevant long-term plan and its infrastructure strategy, and any other relevant 
strategies and plans 
 
Māori, and in particular tangata whenua, values and aspirations for urban 
development 
 
feedback received through the consultation and engagement required by 
clause 3.15 
 
every other National Policy Statement under the Act, including the New Zealand 
Coastal Policy Statement 
 
any other relevant national policy required by, or issued under, legislation. 
3.15 
Consultation and engagement  
 
When preparing or updating an FDS local authorities must use the special consultative 
procedure in section 83 of the Local Government Act 2002. 
 
In order to prepare the draft required by that procedure, local authorities must engage 
with the following: 
 
other local authorities with whom there are significant connections relating to 
infrastructure or community 
 
relevant central government agencies 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
20 
National Policy Statement on Urban Development 2020 – updated May 2022  
 
relevant hapū and iwi 
 
providers of additional infrastructure 
 
relevant providers of nationally significant infrastructure 
 
the development sector (to identify significant future development opportunities 
and infrastructure requirements).  
3.16 
Review of FDS 
 
Every tier 1 and tier 2 local authority must regularly review its FDS to determine whether 
it needs updating, and the review must be done in time to inform the next long-term 
plan (ie, every 3 years). 
 
The review must: 
 
engage with the development sector and landowners to identify significant future 
development opportunities and associated infrastructure requirements; and 
 
consider the most recent HBA. 
 
If, following the review, the local authority decides that the FDS does not need updating, 
that decision and the reasons for it must be publicly notified.  
 
If, following the review, the local authority decides that the FDS is to be updated, the 
local authority must follow the same processes for consultation as apply to the 
preparation of an FDS, but only in relation to the aspects proposed to be updated.  
3.17 
Effect of FDS 
 
Every tier 1 and tier 2 local authority: 
 
must have regard to the relevant FDS when preparing or changing RMA planning 
documents; and 
 
is strongly encouraged to use the relevant FDS to inform: 
(i) 
long-term plans, and particularly infrastructure strategies; and  
(ii) 
regional land transport plans prepared by a local authority under Part 2 
of the Land Transport Management Act 2003; and 
(iii) 
any other relevant strategies and plans.  
3.18 
FDS implementation plan 
 
Every tier 1 and tier 2 local authority must prepare and implement an implementation 
plan for its FDS.  
 
If a tier 1 or tier 2 local authority consists of more than one local authority, the 
implementation plan must be prepared as a single document by all the local 
authorities that jointly prepared the FDS. 
 
Every implementation plan, or part of an implementation plan, must be 
updated annually.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
National Policy Statement on Urban Development 2020 – updated May 2022 
21 
 
An implementation plan or part of an implementation plan: 
 
is not part of the FDS to which it relates; and 
 
does not need to be prepared using the consultation and engagement 
requirements set out in clause 3.15; and 
 
does not have the effect of an FDS as described in clause 3.17. 
Subpart 5 – Housing and Business Development 
Capacity Assessment (HBA) 
3.19 
Obligation to prepare HBA 
 
Every tier 1 and tier 2 local authority must prepare, and make publicly available, an HBA 
for its tier 1 or tier 2 urban environments every 3 years, in time to inform the relevant 
local authority’s next long-term plan.  
 
The HBA must apply, at a minimum, to the relevant tier 1 or tier 2 urban environments 
of the local authority (ie, must assess demand and capacity within the boundaries of 
those urban environments), but may apply to any wider area. 
 
If more than one tier 1 or tier 2 local authority has jurisdiction over a tier 1 or tier 2 
urban environment, those local authorities are jointly responsible for preparing an 
HBA as required by this subpart. 
3.20 
Purpose of HBA 
 
The purpose of an HBA is to: 
 
provide information on the demand and supply of housing and of business land 
in the relevant tier 1 or tier 2 urban environment, and the impact of planning 
and infrastructure decisions of the relevant local authorities on that demand 
and supply; and 
 
inform RMA planning documents, FDSs, and long-term plans; and 
 
quantify the development capacity that is sufficient to meet expected demand 
for housing and for business land in the short term, medium term, and long term.  
3.21 
Involving development sector and others 
 
In preparing an HBA, every tier 1 and tier 2 local authority must seek information and 
comment from: 
 
expert or experienced people in the development sector; and 
 
providers of development infrastructure and additional infrastructure; and 
 
anyone else who has information that may materially affect the calculation of the 
development capacity. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
22 
National Policy Statement on Urban Development 2020 – updated May 2022  
3.22 
Competitiveness margin 
 
A competitiveness margin is a margin of development capacity, over and above the 
expected demand that tier 1 and tier 2 local authorities are required to provide, that 
is required in order to support choice and competitiveness in housing and business 
land markets.  
 
The competitiveness margins for both housing and business land are:  
 
for the short term, 20% 
 
for the medium term, 20% 
 
for the long term, 15%. 
Housing 
3.23 
Analysis of housing market and impact of planning 
 
Every HBA must include analysis of how the relevant local authority’s planning decisions 
and provision of infrastructure affects the affordability and competitiveness of the local 
housing market. 
 
The analysis must include an assessment of how well the current and likely future 
demands for housing by Māori and different groups in the community (such as older 
people, renters, homeowners, low-income households, visitors, and seasonal workers) 
are met, including the demand for different types and forms of housing (such as for 
lower-cost housing, papakāinga, and seasonal worker or student accommodation). 
 
The analysis must be informed by: 
 
market indicators, including: 
(i) 
indicators of housing affordability, housing demand, and housing supply; 
and 
(ii) 
information about household incomes, housing prices, and rents; and 
 
price efficiency indicators. 
3.24 
Housing demand assessment 
 
Every HBA must estimate, for the short term, medium term, and long term, the demand 
for additional housing in the region and each constituent district of the tier 1 or tier 2 
urban environment: 
 
in different locations; and 
 
in terms of dwelling types. 
 
Local authorities may identify locations in any way they choose.  
 
Local authorities may identify the types of dwellings in any way they chose but must, 
at a minimum, distinguish between standalone dwellings and attached dwellings. 
 
The demand for housing must be expressed in terms of numbers of dwellings. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
National Policy Statement on Urban Development 2020 – updated May 2022 
23 
 
Every HBA must: 
 
set out a range of projections of demand for housing in the short term, medium 
term, and long term; and 
 
identify which of the projections are the most likely in each of the short term, 
medium term, and long term; and 
 
set out the assumptions underpinning the different projections and the reason for 
selecting the most likely; and 
 
if those assumptions involve a high level of uncertainty, the nature and potential 
effects of that uncertainty.  
3.25 
Housing development capacity assessment 
 
Every HBA must quantify, for the short term, medium term, and long term, the housing 
development capacity for housing in the region and each constituent district of the tier 1 
or tier 2 urban environment that is: 
 
plan-enabled; and 
 
plan-enabled and infrastructure-ready; and 
 
plan-enabled, infrastructure-ready, and feasible and reasonably expected to 
be realised. 
 
The development capacity must be quantified as numbers of dwellings: 
 
in different locations, including in existing and new urban areas; and 
 
of different types, including standalone dwellings and attached dwellings. 
3.26 
Estimating what is feasible and reasonably expected to 
be realised 
 
For the purpose of estimating the amount of development capacity that is reasonably 
expected to be realised, or that is both feasible and reasonably expected to be realised, 
local authorities: 
 
may use any appropriate method; but 
 
must outline and justify the methods, inputs, and assumptions used to arrive at 
the estimates.  
 
The following are examples of the kind of methods that a tier 1 local authority could use 
to assess the amount of development capacity that is feasible and reasonably expected 
to be realised: 
 
separately estimate the number of feasible dwellings (using a feasibility model) 
and the number of dwellings that can reasonably be expected to be realised 
(using building consents data on the number of sites and extent of allowed 
capacity that has been previously developed), for the short, medium and long 
term; compare the numbers of dwellings estimated by each method; then pick 
the lower of the numbers in each time period, to represent the amount of 
development capacity that is feasible and reasonably expected to be realised 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
24 
National Policy Statement on Urban Development 2020 – updated May 2022  
 
estimate the number of feasible dwellings or sites, and then assess the proportion 
of these that can reasonably be expected to be developed in the short, medium 
and long term, using information about landowner and developer intentions 
 
integrate information about past development trends and future landowner and 
developer intentions into the feasibility model, which could mean modifying 
assumptions about densities, heights, and timing of development. 
 
The following is an example of the kind of methods that a tier 2 local authority could use 
to assess the amount of development capacity that is feasible and reasonably expected 
to be realised: 
 
assess the number of dwellings that can reasonably be expected to be developed 
(using building consents data on the number of sites and extent of allowed 
capacity that has been developed previously), for the short, medium and 
long term; and  
 
then seek advice from the development sector about what factors affect the 
feasibility of development. 
 
Different methods may be appropriate when assessing the development capacity that 
is reasonably expected to be realised in different circumstances, such as: 
 
in existing, as opposed to new, urban areas; and 
 
for stand-alone, as opposed to attached, dwellings. 
3.27 
Assessment of sufficient development capacity for housing 
 
Every HBA must clearly identify, for the short term, medium term, and long term, where 
there is sufficient development capacity to meet demand for housing in the region and 
each constituent district of the tier 1 or tier 2 urban environment. 
 
The requirements of subclause (1) must be based on a comparison of: 
 
the demand for housing referred to in clause 3.24 plus the appropriate 
competitiveness margin; and 
 
the development capacity identified under clause 3.25. 
 
If there is any insufficiency, the HBA must identify where and when this will occur 
and analyse the extent to which RMA planning documents, a lack of development 
infrastructure, or both, cause or contribute to the insufficiency.  
Business land 
3.28 
Business land demand assessment 
 
Every HBA must estimate, for the short term, medium term, and long term, the 
demand from each business sector for additional business land in the region and 
each constituent district of the tier 1 or tier 2 urban environment.  
 
The demand must be expressed in hectares or floor areas. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
National Policy Statement on Urban Development 2020 – updated May 2022 
25 
 
For the purpose of this clause, a local authority may identify business sectors in any way 
it chooses but must, as a minimum, distinguish between sectors that would use land 
zoned for commercial, retail, or industrial uses. 
 
The HBA for a tier 1 urban environment must: 
 
set out a range of projections of demand for business land by business sector, 
for the short term, medium term, and long term; and 
 
identify which of the projections is the most likely in each of the short term, 
medium term, and long term; and 
 
set out the assumptions underpinning the different projections and the reason 
for selecting which is the most likely; and 
 
if those assumptions involve a high level of uncertainty, the nature and potential 
effects of that uncertainty.  
 
The HBA for a tier 2 urban environment must: 
 
set out the most likely projection of demand for business land by business sector 
in the short term, medium term, and long term; and 
 
set out the assumptions underpinning that projection; and 
 
if those assumptions involve a high level of uncertainty, the nature and potential 
effects of that uncertainty.  
3.29 
Business land development capacity assessment  
 
Every HBA must estimate the following, for the short term, medium term, and 
long term, for the region and each constituent district of the tier 1 or tier 2 urban 
environment: 
 
the development capacity (in terms of hectares or floor areas) to meet expected 
demand for business land for each business sector, plus the appropriate 
competitiveness margin; and 
 
of that development capacity, the development capacity that is:  
(i) 
plan-enabled; and 
(ii) 
plan-enabled and infrastructure-ready; and 
(iii) 
plan-enabled, infrastructure-ready, and suitable for each business sector. 
 
A local authority may define what it means for development capacity to be “suitable” 
in any way it chooses, but suitability must, at a minimum, include suitability in terms 
of location and site size. 
3.30 
Assessment of sufficient development capacity for business land 
 
Every HBA must clearly identify, for the short term, medium term, and long term, 
whether there is sufficient development capacity to meet demand for business land 
in the region and each constituent district of the tier 1 or tier 2 urban environment. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
26 
National Policy Statement on Urban Development 2020 – updated May 2022  
 
The requirements of subclause (1) must be based on a comparison of: 
 
the demand for business land referred to in clause 3.28 plus the appropriate 
competitiveness margin; and 
 
the development capacity identified under clause 3.29. 
 
If there is any insufficiency, the HBA must identify where and when this will occur 
and analyse the extent to which RMA planning documents, a lack of development 
infrastructure, or both, cause or contribute to the insufficiency.  
Subpart 6 – Intensification in tier 1 urban environments 
3.31 
Tier 1 territorial authorities implementing intensification policies 
 
Every tier 1 territorial authority must identify, by location, the building heights and 
densities required by Policy 3.  
 
If the territorial authority considers that it is necessary to modify the building height 
or densities in order to provide for a qualifying matter (as permitted under Policy 4), 
it must: 
 
identify, by location, where the qualifying matter applies; and 
 
specify the alternate building heights and densities proposed for those areas. 
 
The territorial authority must make the information required by subclauses (1) and (2) 
publicly available at the same time as it notifies any plan change or proposed plan 
change to give effect to Policy 3. 
3.32 
Qualifying matters 
 
In this National Policy Statement, qualifying matter means any of the following:  
 
a matter of national importance that decision-makers are required to recognise 
and provide for under section 6 of the Act 
 
a matter required in order to give effect to any other National Policy Statement, 
including the New Zealand Coastal Policy Statement 
 
any matter required for the purpose of ensuring the safe or efficient operation of 
nationally significant infrastructure 
 
open space provided for public use, but only in relation to the land that is open 
space 
 
an area subject to a designation or heritage order, but only in relation to the land 
that is subject to the designation or heritage order 
 
a matter necessary to implement, or ensure consistency with, iwi participation 
legislation  
 
the requirement to provide sufficient business land suitable for low density uses 
to meet expected demand under this National Policy Statement  
 
any other matter that makes higher density development as directed by Policy 3 
inappropriate in an area, but only if the requirements of clause 3.33(3) are met. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
National Policy Statement on Urban Development 2020 – updated May 2022 
27 
3.33 
Requirements if qualifying matter applies 
 
This clause applies if a territorial authority is amending its district plan and intends to 
rely on Policy 4 to justify a modification to the direction in Policy 3 in relation to 
a specific area. 
 
The evaluation report prepared under section 32 of the Act in relation to the proposed 
amendment must: 
 
demonstrate why the territorial authority considers that: 
(i) 
the area is subject to a qualifying matter; and 
(ii) 
the qualifying matter is incompatible with the level of development 
directed by Policy 3 for that area; and  
 
assess the impact that limiting development capacity, building height or density 
(as relevant) will have on the provision of development capacity; and  
 
assess the costs and broader impacts of imposing those limits. 
 
A matter is not a qualifying matter under clause 3.32(1)(h) in relation to an area unless 
the evaluation report also:  
 
identifies the specific characteristic that makes the level of development directed 
by Policy 3 inappropriate in the area, and justifies why that is inappropriate in 
light of the national significance of urban development and the objectives of this 
National Policy Statement; and 
 
includes a site-specific analysis that:  
(i) 
identifies the site to which the matter relates; and 
(ii) 
evaluates the specific characteristics on a site-specific basis to determine 
the spatial extent where intensification needs to be compatible with the 
specific matter; and 
(iii) 
evaluates an appropriate range of options to achieve the greatest heights 
and densities directed by Policy 3, while managing the specific 
characteristics.  
3.34 
Effects on consideration of resource consents 
 
Nothing in Policies 3 or 4 or this subpart precludes the consideration (under section 104 
of the Act) of any actual or potential effects on the environment associated with 
building heights. 
Subpart 7 – Development outcomes for zones 
3.35 
Development outcomes for zones 
 
Every tier 1, 2 or 3 territorial authority must ensure that: 
 
the objectives for every zone in an urban environment in its district describe 
the development outcomes intended for the zone over the life of the plan and 
beyond; and 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
28 
National Policy Statement on Urban Development 2020 – updated May 2022  
 
the policies and rules in its district plan are individually and cumulatively 
consistent with the development outcomes described in the objectives 
for each zone. 
3.36 
Development outcomes consistent with intensification policies 
 
Every tier 1 territorial authority must ensure that the development outcomes for zones 
in its tier 1 urban environments are consistent with the outcomes required by Policy 3. 
3.37 
Monitoring development outcomes 
 
Every tier 1 territorial authority must monitor the extent to which development is 
occurring in each of the following zones as anticipated by the development outcomes 
included in the objectives for the zone: 
 
city centre zones 
 
metropolitan centre zones 
 
town centre zones 
 
mixed use zones 
 
high density residential zones 
 
medium density residential zones 
 
general residential zones.  
 
If monitoring under this clause indicates that development outcomes are not being 
realised, the territorial authority must, as soon as practicable:  
 
undertake an assessment to identify whether provisions of the district plan 
(individually and cumulatively), or any other factors (and if so, what factors), 
or both, are contributing to the failure to realise development outcomes; and 
 
give public notice (as defined in the Act) of the results of the assessment. 
 
If the assessment indicates that provisions of a district plan are contributing to the 
failure to realise development outcomes, the territorial authority must change its 
district plan to address the deficiency. 
 
If the assessment indicates that other factors are contributing to the failure to realise 
development outcomes, the territorial authority must consider alternative methods to 
improve the rate of realisation (such as the use of incentives for site amalgamation). 
 
Any plan change required under subclause (3) must be notified as soon as practicable, 
and no later than 12 months after the assessment is publicly notified.  
Subpart 8 – Car parking 
3.38 
Car parking 
 
If the district plan of a tier 1, 2, or 3 territorial authority contains objectives, policies, 
rules, or assessment criteria that have the effect of requiring a minimum number of car 
parks to be provided for a particular development, land use, or activity, the territorial 
authority must change its district plan to remove that effect, other than in respect of 
accessible car parks.  

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
National Policy Statement on Urban Development 2020 – updated May 2022 
29 
 
Territorial authorities must make any changes required by subclause (1) without using 
a process in Schedule 1 of the Act. 
 
Nothing in this National Policy Statement prevents a district plan including objectives, 
policies, rules, or assessment criteria: 
 
requiring a minimum number of accessible car parks to be provided for any 
activity; or 
 
relating to parking dimensions or manoeuvring standards to apply if: 
(i) 
a developer chooses to supply car parks; or 
(ii) 
when accessible car parks are required.
