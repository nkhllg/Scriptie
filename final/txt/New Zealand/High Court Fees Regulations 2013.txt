For the purposes of these regulations, a proceeding that concerns a matter of
genuine public interest is—
(a)
a proceeding that has been or is intended to be commenced to determine
a question of law that is of significant interest to the public or to a
substantial section of the public; or

raises issues of significant interest to the public or to a substantial
section of the public; and
(ii)
has been or is intended to be commenced by an organisation that,
by its governing enactment, constitution, or rules, is expressly or
by necessary implication required to promote matters in the public
interest.
21
Payment of fee may be postponed pending determination of application
for waiver or review
(1)
A person who is awaiting the determination of an application under regulation
18(1) or under section 160 of the Act may apply to the Registrar to postpone
payment of the fee to which the application relates.
r 19
High Court Fees Regulations 2013
Version as at

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2)
If the Registrar is satisfied that the person would be prejudiced if the matter
to which the fee relates did not proceed before the determination, the Registrar
may postpone the payment of the fee until the date on which the person is
notified of the determination.
(3)
An application under subclause (1) must be made in a form approved for the
purpose by the chief executive of the Ministry of Justice unless, in a particular
case, the Registrar considers that an application in that form is not necessary.
22
Recovery of fee if payment postponed
(1)
This regulation applies to a fee if payment of the fee is postponed under
regulation 21.
(2)

Act is that the fee is not to be waived, the fee—
(a)
must be paid, without delay, to the Registrar; and
(b)
is recoverable as a debt due to the Crown in any court of competent
jurisdiction.
(3)
Following a determination that has the effect referred to in subclause (2), the
person responsible for paying the fee may not take a step in the proceeding to
which the fee relates unless the fee is paid.
(4)
This regulation has effect subject to regulation 21 during any period that the
question of the waiver of the fee is the subject of a pending application under
section 160 of the Act.
Refunds
23
Power to refund fees
(1)
A Registrar may, on application made to him or her, refund a fee that has been
paid if satisfied that—
(a)
no application, under regulation 18, for a waiver of the fee was made;
and
(b)
the fee would have been waived, in accordance with regulation 18, had
that application been made; and
(c)

the application for the refund.
