any such party structure such chimney copings, jambs, or
breasts, or flues, or such piers or recesses, or any other like
works as may fairly be required for the convenience of such
adjoining owner, and may be specified in the notice; and it
shall be the duty of the building owner to comply with such
requisition in all cases where the execution of the required
works will not be injurious to the building owner, or cause to
him unnecessary inconvenience or unnecessary delay in the
exercise of his right.
(2)
Any difference that arises between a building owner and an
adjoining owner in respect of the execution of any such works
shall  be  determined  in  the  manner  in  which  differences
between building owners and adjoining owners are hereinafter
directed to be determined.

Notice to be given by building owner before work commences
(1)
A building owner shall not, except with the consent in writing
of the adjoining owner, and of the adjoining occupiers, or in
cases where any wall or party structure is dangerous (in which
cases the appropriate provisions of this Ordinance shall apply),
exercise any of his rights under this Ordinance in respect of
any party fence wall unless at least 1 month, or exercise any of
his rights under this Ordinance in relation to any party wall or
party structure other than a party fence wall, unless at least 2
months before doing so he has served on the adjoining owner
of the party fence wall, the party wall or party structure, as the
case may be, notice stating the nature and particulars of the
proposed work and the time at which the work is proposed to
be commenced.
(2)
When a building owner in the exercise of any of his rights
under this Ordinance lays open any part of the adjoining land
or building, he shall at his own expense make and maintain for
a proper time a proper hoarding and shoring or temporary
construction for protection of the adjoining land or building
and the security of the adjoining occupier.

exercise of any right, unless the work to which the notice
relates is begun within 6 months after the service thereof, and
is prosecuted with due diligence.
(5)
Within 1 month after receipt of such notice the adjoining
owner may serve on the building owner a notice requiring him
to  build  on  any  such  party  structure  any  works  to  the

(7)
If either owner does not, within 14 days after the service on
him of any notice, express his consent thereto, he shall be
considered as having dissented therefrom, and thereupon a
difference shall be deemed to have arisen between the building
owner and the adjoining owner
114.
Differences between building owner and adjoining owner
(1)
In all cases not specially provided for by this Ordinance,
where a difference arises between a building owner and an
adjoining owner in respect of any matter arising with reference
to any work to which any notice given under this Ordinance
relates, unless both parties concur in the appointment of 1
architect  they  shall  each  appoint  an  architect,  and  the  2
architects so appointed shall select a third architect, and such 1
architect, or 3 architects, or any 2 of them, shall settle any
matter from time to time during the continuance of any work
to which the notice relates in dispute between such building
owner and adjoining owner, with power by his or their award
to determine the right to do, and the time and manner of doing
any work, and generally any other matter arising out of or
incidental to such difference; but any time so appointed for
doing any work shall not, unless otherwise agreed, commence
until  after  the  expiration  of  the  period  by  this  Ordinance
prescribed for the notice in the particular case. (Amended L.N.
159 of 1990)
(2)
Any award given by such 1 architect, or by such 3 architects,
or by any 2 of them, shall be conclusive, and shall not be
questioned in any court; with this exception, that either of the
parties to the difference may within 14 days from the date of
the delivery of the award, appeal therefrom to a judge in
chambers,  who  may,  subject  as  hereafter  in  this  section
mentioned, rescind the award or modify it in such manner as
he thinks just.
(3)
If either party to the difference makes default in appointing an
architect for 10 days after notice has been served on him by
the other party to make such appointment, the party giving the
notice may make the appointment in the place of the party so
making default.
(4)
The costs incurred in making or obtaining the award shall be
paid by such party as the architect or architects determine.
(5)
If the appellant on appearing before the judge declares his
unwillingness to have the matter decided by him, and proves
to his satisfaction that in the event of the matter being decided
against him he will be liable to pay a sum, exclusive of costs,
exceeding $500, and gives security, to be approved by the
judge,  duly  to  prosecute  an  action  in  the  Court  of  First
Instance and to abide the event thereof, all proceedings in
Chambers shall thereupon be stayed, and the appellant may
bring an action in the Court of First Instance against the other
party to the difference. (Amended 62 of 2000 s. 3)
(6)
The plaintiff in such action shall deliver to the defendants an
issue whereby the matters in difference between them may be
tried, and the form of such issue in case of dispute or of the
non-appearance of the defendant shall be settled by the court,
and the action shall be prosecuted and the issue tried in all
respects as if it were an ordinary action or issue in the Court of
First  Instance,  or  as  near  thereto  as  circumstances
admit. (Amended 62 of 2000 s. 3)

(7)
If the parties agree as to the facts a special case may be stated
for the opinion of the court, and such case shall be heard and
decided in all respects as if it were an ordinary case stated for
the opinion of the court, or as near thereto as circumstances
admit; and any costs that may have been incurred before the
judge in chambers shall be deemed to be costs incurred in the
action and be payable accordingly.
(8)
Where both parties have concurred in the appointment of 1
architect, then, if he refuses, or for 7 days neglects to act, or if
he dies or becomes incapable of acting before he has made his
award, the matters in dispute shall be determined in the same
manner as if he had not been appointed.
(9)
Where  each  party  has  appointed  an  architect  and  a  third
architect has been selected, then, if he refuses, or for 7 days
neglects to act, or before such difference is settled, dies, or
becomes incapable of acting, the 2 architects shall forthwith
select another architect in his place who shall have the same
powers and authorities as were vested in his predecessor.
(10)
Where each party has appointed an architect, then, if the 2
architects refuse, or, for 7 days after request of either party,
neglect to select a third architect, or another third architect as
aforesaid the Chief Executive may, on the application of either
party, appoint the Director of Buildings or some other fit
person to act as third architect who shall have the same powers
and authorities as if he had been selected by the 2 architects
appointed by the parties. (Amended L.N. 76 of 1982; L.N. 94 of
1986; L.N. 291 of 1993; 62 of 2000 s. 3)
(11)
Where each party has appointed an architect, then, if before
the  difference  is  settled  either  architect  dies,  or  becomes
incapable of acting, the party by whom he was appointed may
appoint some other architect to act in his place, and if for the
space of 7 days after notice served on him by the other party
for that purpose, he fails to do so, the other architect may
proceed ex parte, and his decision shall be as effectual as if he
had been a single architect in whose appointment both parties
had concurred; an architect so substituted as aforesaid shall
have the same powers and authorities as were vested in the
former architect at the time of his death or disability.
(12)
Where each party has appointed an architect, then, if either of
the architects refuses, or for 7 days neglects to act the other
may proceed ex parte, and his decision shall be as effectual as
if he had been a single architect in whose appointment both
parties had concurred.

building, and such notice shall be accompanied by a plan
and sections, showing the site of the proposed building,
and the depth to which he proposes to excavate;
(b)
if the adjoining owner shall, within 14 days after being
served with such notice, give a counternotice in writing
that he disputes the necessity of such underpinning or
strengthening, or that he requires such underpinning or
strengthening,  then,  if  such  counternotice  is  not
acquiesced  in,  a  difference  shall  be  deemed  to  have
arisen between  the building owner and the adjoining
owner;
(c)
the building owner shall be liable to compensate the
adjoining owner and occupier for any inconvenience,
loss or damage which may result to them by reason of
the exercise of the powers conferred by this section;

If the adjoining owner does not within 1 month after service of
the counter requisition give security accordingly, he shall at
the end of that month be deemed to have ceased to be entitled

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c)
that the person is required to comply with the notice
served under section 30C(3) or (4), and if the person‚Äôs
failure to comply with the notice continues, the Building
Authority may‚Äî
(i)
serve on the person a further penalty notice after the
expiry of the penalty notice that is being served; or
(ii)
proceed to take court proceedings for the person‚Äôs
failure  to  comply  with  the  notice  served  under
section 30C(3) or (4), and the person would be
liable to the fine and imprisonment mentioned in
section 40(1BD); and
(d)
any other related matters, including payment instructions
for payment of the fixed penalty.
2.
Section 35 applies to the service of a penalty notice under section
40(1BE).
3.
If any person on whom a penalty notice has been served has failed
to pay the fixed penalty of $1,500, and has not notified the Building
Authority that the person wishes to dispute liability, within 21 days
after  the  date  of  the  penalty  notice,  a  magistrate  may,  on  an
application being made in the manner mentioned in section 4 of this
Schedule, order the person to pay the fixed penalty of $1,500,
together with a sum of $300 by way of costs, within 21 days after
the date of service of notice of the order.
4.
An application under section 3 of this Schedule‚Äî
(a)
may be made in the absence of the person on whom the
penalty notice has been served; and
(b)
must be made in the name of the Secretary for Justice,
who may appoint any person or class of persons to make
the application.
5.
Despite the Magistrate Ordinance (Cap. 227),  in  an  application
under section 3 of this Schedule, a magistrate may make an order
under that section on production by the applicant to the magistrate
of‚Äî
(a)
a  copy  of  the  penalty  notice  served  under  section
40(1BE); and
(b)
a certificate of service under section 35(2).
6.
In an application under section 3 of this Schedule, a certificate
stating‚Äî
(a)
that payment of the fixed penalty of $1,500 had not been
made before the date specified in the certificate; and
(b)
that the person specified in it had not, before the date
specified  in  the  certificate,  notified  the  Building
Authority that the person wished to dispute liability for
the offence under section 40(1BD),
and purporting to be signed by or for the Building Authority is to be
admitted in evidence without further proof on its production to the
magistrate  and,  unless  there  is  evidence  to  the  contrary,  it  is
presumed that the certificate is so signed and the certificate is
evidence of the facts stated in it.
7.
If an order is made under section 3 of this Schedule‚Äî

(a)
the magistrate must cause notice of the order to be served
on the person to whom it relates; and
(b)
the sending of the notice to the person by post at the
person‚Äôs  address  mentioned  in  the  penalty  notice
constitutes good service.
8.
If  any  person  against  whom  an  order  under  section  3  of  this
Schedule has been made fails to pay the fixed penalty and costs, the
person is taken, for the purposes of section 68 of the Magistrates
Ordinance (Cap. 227), to have failed to pay the sum adjudged to be
paid by a conviction and is liable to be imprisoned under that
section.
9.
If there is evidence to show that a penalty notice served under
section 40(1BE) has not come to the notice of the person to whom it
relates before the date of the order made under section 3 of this
Schedule, the magistrate may, on an application of which reasonable
notice has been given to the Building Authority, rescind the order
and‚Äî
(a)
if the person wishes to dispute liability for the offence
under section 40(1BD), give leave to that effect; or
(b)
if that person does not wish to dispute liability, order that
person to pay the fixed penalty of $1,500 within 21 days
after the date of the order.
10.
An application for rescission of an order under section 9 of this
Schedule may be made in person or by counsel or solicitor on
behalf  of  the  applicant  and  the  magistrate,  for  the  purpose  of
securing the attendance of witnesses and generally for conducting
the  proceedings,  has  all  the  powers  of  a  magistrate  hearing  a
complaint under the Magistrates Ordinance (Cap. 227).
11.
An application for rescission of an order under section 9 of this
Schedule must be made within 21 days after the date of service of
notice of the order made under section 3 of this Schedule, but the
magistrate  may  extend  the  period  if  he  or  she  considers  it
appropriate to do so in the circumstances.
12.
If a magistrate gives leave under section 9(a) of this Schedule,
proceedings may be taken, despite section 26 of the Magistrates
Ordinance (Cap. 227), within 6 months after the date on which the
magistrate gives the leave.
13.
A magistrate may for good cause, on an application by the Building
Authority at any time, rescind any order for the payment of a fixed
penalty  and  costs  and  any  other  order  made  in  the  same
proceedings.
14.
If any person against whom an order under section 9(b) of this
Schedule has been made fails to pay the fixed penalty, the person is
taken, for the purposes of section 68 of the Magistrates Ordinance
(Cap. 227), to have failed to pay the sum adjudged to be paid by a
conviction and is liable to be imprisoned under that section.

15.
If any person on whom a penalty notice under section 40(1BE) has
been served notifies the Building Authority that the person wishes
to dispute liability or the person is given leave under section 9(a) of
this Schedule, proceedings may be taken against that person, and a
summons issued in those proceedings may be served on that person
in accordance with section 8 of the Magistrates Ordinance (Cap.
227).
16.
In proceedings under section 15 of this Schedule,  if  the  court
determines that the person is guilty of the offence of failing to
comply with the notice served on the person under section 30C(3)
or (4) without reasonable excuse, the person is liable to the fine and
imprisonment under section 40(1BD).
17.
After proceedings have been instituted but not less than 2 days
(excluding  any  Saturday  and  public  holiday)  before  the  day
specified in the summons for the person‚Äôs appearance, the person
may pay the fixed penalty of $1,500 and a sum of $500 by way of
costs with the production of the summons at any magistracy to
terminate the proceedings. (Amended 18 of 2016 s. 14)
18.
If a person‚Äôs failure to comply with the notice served on the person
under section 30C(3) or (4) continues without reasonable excuse
despite a penalty notice served under section 40(1BE), the Building
Authority may‚Äî
(a)
serve on the person a further penalty notice after the
expiry of the penalty notice that is being served; or
(b)
proceed to take court proceedings against the person
under section 40(1BD).
19.
The decision of the Building Authority to serve a penalty notice
under section 18 of this Schedule is not subject to appeal under
section 44.
