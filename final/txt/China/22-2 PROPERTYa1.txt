Practice Note 
Approval or Consent under Lease 
Issue No. 4/2021 
A Government lease1 is a contract between the Government as lessor/ landlord 
and the other party as lessee/ tenant, which may contain, amongst other matters, 
provisions requiring the prior approval or consent of the lessor/ i'andlord in relation to 
various requirements or restrictions specified in the conditions of the lease. The Director 
of Lands ("the Director") acting in the capacity of a lessor/ landlord for the Government 
may grant approval or consent subject to such tenns and conditions as he sees fit, 
including the charging of a premium, having regard to the circumstances of the case. 
2 . 
Where the approval or consent is obtained pursuant to the relevant clauses of 
the Government lease and does not involve relaxation of lease requirements or 
restrictions, no premium will be charged. A list of clauses in the lease involving such 
typical situations is set out in Part (I) of Appendix A for reference. 
3. 
As to the approval or consent that has to be obtained from the Government for 
relaxation of certain requirements or restriGtions under the relevant clauses of the 
Government lease, the Director may exercise his absolute discretion under the lease to 
grant, not to grant or grant it on such terms and conditions as he deems fit, including the 
charging of a premium. The general principle is that a premium may be charged if the 
approval or consent would result in an enhancement in development potential or value 
of the land. 
Streamlined Arrangements 
4. 
As part of the streamlining drive, the Government has reviewed the situations 
where premium may or may not be charged upon granting of approval or consent for 
relaxation of requirements or restrictions under the relevant clauses of the Government 
lease. The Government has set out the situations where premium may not be charged 
when granting of approval or consent under certain clauses on the precondition that 
the lot owner's proposal for the matter under application is acceptable to the concerned 
bureau(x) and/ or departrnent(s). A list of such situations with reference to the relevant 
clauses in the lease is set out in Part (II) of Appendix A. For general reference, a list 
of typical situations where premium may be charged is set out in Appendix B. 
5. 
The Lands Depru1ment ("LandsD") will also put in place streamlined 
All references to "Government lease" or "lease" in this Practice Note shall include Government Lease 
or Conditions of Sale/ Grant/ Exchange, etc. (as the case may be) and "leases" shall be construed 
accordingly. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
arrangements for assessing and granting certain approval or consent under the relevant 
clauses of the Government lease when checking the general building plans ("GBP") 
submitted. First, approval or consent pursuant to the specified clauses in Part (I) of 
Appendix A and all clauses in Part (II) of Appendix A might generally be assessed 
and granted at the GBP checking stage2. For these cases, separate application for 
approval or consent would not be required. 
6. 
Second, for approval or consent of the specified situations in Appendix B which 
might generally be assessed and granted during the GBP checking stage, a fast-track 
procedure will be introduced. LandsD would aim to advise the lot owner of the premium 
payable within 16 weeks upon receipt of a valid application. Upon the lot owner's 
settlement of the premium and administrative fee, a consent letter alongside with the GBP 
approval pe1initting the lot to be developed in accordance with the agreed set of GBP for 
the lifetime of the building(s) will be issued. If the lot owner so wishes, he may apply for 
a lease modification in accordance with the established mechanism instead of seeking 
approval or consent for the propo~ed development for its lifetime. 
7. 
Nothing in this practice note ("PN") shall in any way fetter, affect or prejudice 
the rights of the Government, the Director and their officers under the relevant 
Government lease or the Government's rights as lessor/ landlord, and all such rights are 
hereby reserved. Besides, nothing in this PN, including any words and expressions used, 
shall in any way be construed as any waiver of any provisions under the Government 
lease or affect or bind the Government in relation to interpretation or enforcement of the 
tenns and conditions of the relevant Government lease. All rights to modify the whole 
or any part of this PN are hereby reserved. 
8. 
This PN is not applicable to any building which, by reason of the Buildings 
Ordinance (Application to the New Territories) Ordinance (Cap. 121 ), is exempted from 
the provisions of the Buildings Ordinance (Cap. 123).

Lands Administration Office PN Issue No. 4/2018 sets out the various stages of GBP checking under 
lease conditions. For general informatjon, approval or consent issued under specific provision(s) under 
lease would be effective for lifetime of the building(s) for which the GBP has been approved.
