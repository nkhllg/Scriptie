(1)
The Government may dispose of or otherwise deal with any
property  or  right  vested  in  it  under  section  292  of  the
predecessor Ordinance or section 752(1), or an interest in the
property or right, in the same manner as it may dispose of or
otherwise deal with any other property or right vested in it as
bona vacantia, even though the company may be restored to
the Companies Register under this Division or section 290 of
the Companies (Winding Up and Miscellaneous Provisions)
Ordinance (Cap. 32). (Amended 35 of 2018 s. 73)
(2)
Subsections (3), (4), (5) and (6) apply if the company is
restored to the Companies Register.
(3)
The restoration does not affect the disposition or dealing.
(4)
Subsection (3) does not limit the effect of the restoration in
relation to any other property or right previously vested in or
held on trust for the company.
(5)
If  any  property,  right  or  interest  is  still  vested  in  the
Government at the time of the restoration, it revests in the
company subject to any liability, interest or claim that was
attached to the property, right or interest immediately before
the revest.
(6)
Subject to subsection (7), the Government must pay to the
company—
(a)
if the Government received any consideration for the
property, right or interest disposed of or otherwise dealt
with, an amount equal to—
(i)
the amount of the consideration; or
(ii)
the value of the consideration as at the date of the
disposition or dealing; or
(b)
if no consideration was received, an amount equal to the
value of the property, right or interest disposed of or
otherwise dealt with as at the date of the disposition or
dealing.
(7)
There  may  be  deducted  from  the  amount  payable  under
subsection  (6)  the  Government’s  reasonable  costs  in
connection with the disposition or dealing to the extent that the
costs have not been paid to the Government as a condition of a
restoration under section 762 or pursuant to a direction under
section 768.
