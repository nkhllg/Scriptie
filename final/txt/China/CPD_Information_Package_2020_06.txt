INTRODUCTION 
 
What is continuing professional development? 
 
Continuing professional development (“CPD”) is the systematic maintenance, improvement 
and broadening of relevant knowledge and skills to enable a professional to successfully 
carry out his professional duties and responsibilities throughout his career. 
  
Whilst the CPD scheme (“CPD Scheme”) may be seen by some as a burdensome 
requirement, our profession is self regulatory and the Council is obliged to ensure the 
establishment and promotion of high standards of work within the profession.  This includes 
the encouragement of the continued study and acquisition of legal knowledge and skills by 
legal practitioners. 
 
Moreover, in a changing legal environment with the profession subject to many external 
pressures, CPD provides a convenient framework for the profession to meet the changing 
demands of clients and society to continuously update knowledge and skills, to improve the 
efficiency and effectiveness of the profession and to enable some practitioners to redefine 
their careers by learning new professional skills and areas of practice. 
 
The CPD Scheme has been designed to be as flexible as possible so that the relevant number 
of CPD points may be acquired in a time conscious and cost effective manner. The Law 
Society (“Society”) has taken into consideration the need for busy practitioners to comply 
with CPD requirements through other methods of learning than attendance at traditional 
lecture-based courses. For example, conducting Dissertations, writing legal articles and 
books, attending distance learning courses and preparing and presenting courses are treated as 
CPD activities. 
 
Criteria for accreditation of CPD activities 
 
A CPD activity shall: 
 
(a) 
seek to extend, develop, maintain and enhance professional knowledge, skills, 
abilities, attitudes and ethics in areas that are relevant to the practice needs and 
professional standards of solicitors and/or trainee solicitors; and 
 
(b) 
be of significant or sufficient intellectual or professional or practical content; and  
 
(c) 
deal with substantive, procedural, ethical or practice management matters (including 
client care and relations) or skills directly related or relevant to practitioners’ practice 
of law; and 
 
(d) 
be conducted by a person who is qualified by practical or academic or professional 
experience in the subject covered; and 
 
(e) 
have as its objective the development and maintenance of practitioners’ competency 
in ethics, professional conduct, legal knowledge and skills and/or legal practice 
management.

This Information Package contains the current rules governing the CPD Scheme and the 
policies and guidelines of the Council in relation to the practical application of the CPD 
Scheme. 
 
All trainee solicitors and solicitors covered by the CPD Scheme (hereinafter called “the 
practitioners”) should acquaint themselves with the information in this Information Package, 
in particular, the CPD Rules Cap. 159W (“CPD Rules”) and the Guidelines for Compliance 
with CPD requirements, and ensure that proper attention is given to their participation in 
CPD activities throughout each CPD practice year. 
 
HONOUR-BASED CPD SCHEME 
 
The CPD Scheme is an honour-based CPD Scheme. 
 
Practitioners are required to register their attendance but they are not required to scan their 
Society membership card at the course venue. After completion of an accredited CPD course, 
a practitioner shall make a record of the CPD point(s) awarded to the course in his own 
training record provided that no CPD points should be claimed by him if he is absent from 
the course (excluding scheduled breaks) for more than 10 minutes for a course of less than 3 
hours or for more than 30 minutes for a course of 3 hours or more.

The Society does not keep records of individual practitioners’ attendance at courses. All 
practitioners must keep their own training record for 2 CPD practice years and, where records 
involved CPD point(s) carried from previous CPD practice years, for those previous CPD 
practice years. The training record form can be downloaded from the Society’s website at 
www.hklawsoc.org.hk

MANDATORY CPD REQUIREMENTS 
 
Practitioners required to undertake CPD 
 
Since 1 January 2003, the CPD Scheme has applied to all trainee solicitors and to all 
solicitors with practising certificates. 
 
Exemption from the CPD Scheme for very senior solicitors may be available upon certain 
conditions. Please refer to page 59 of this Information Package for details. 
 
 
The CPD requirement 
 
A solicitor or a trainee solicitor must accumulate 15 CPD points in each CPD practice year.  
 
However, a trainee solicitor must accumulate 30 CPD points by the end of his period of 
employment as a trainee solicitor and on a pro-rata basis in accordance with Table A and/or 
Table A1. 
 
 
The CPD practice year 
 
A CPD practice year is a period of 12 months commencing on 1 November and ending on 31 
October the following year.   
 
 
The CPD requirement for solicitor-mediators 
 
Solicitors who have been admitted to the Panel(s) of General and/or Family Mediators and/or 
Family Mediation Supervisors of the Society can maintain their membership on the Panel(s) 
for a period of 4 years from the date of their admission to the relevant Panel(s). Membership 
on the Panels can be renewed, subject to, amongst other things, the Panel Member 
demonstrating to the Society's Mediator and Parenting Coordinator Admission Committee 
that he has undertaken the relevant CPD points or has been exempted from the CPD 
requirement as set out below: 
 
(a) 
A total of at least 20 CPD points in mediation training out of the annual CPD  
requirement of the solicitor-mediator. 
 
(b) 
The 20 CPD points on mediation training obtained during the 4 CPD years prior to  
renewal shall exclude the CPD points obtained from training course(s) that  
fulfilled the training requirements in Stage 1 (General and Family) and Stage 3 
(Family) of the requirements to be an Admitted Mediator. 
 
(c) 
Exemptions from the CPD requirement in mediation training may be granted by the  
Mediator and Parenting Coordinator Admission Committee on a case-by-case basis 
where exceptional circumstances exist and where it is fair and reasonable to do so.

The CPD requirement for trainee solicitors  
 
A trainee solicitor is required to complete 15 CPD points during each CPD practice year 
(which commences on 1 November and ends on 31 October the following year).   
 
Commencement of a trainee solicitor contract after the commencement of a CPD 
practice year 
 
Trainee solicitors are advised to note that when their trainee solicitor contract commences 
after the commencement of a CPD practice year, they will be required to complete their CPD 
requirement on a pro-rata basis.     
 
Under those circumstances, the annual 15 CPD points requirement will be determined on a 
pro-rata basis in accordance with Table A below.

Table A - Pro-rata requirement for trainee solicitors where they commence their trainee 
                 solicitor contract after the commencement of a CPD practice year 
 
 
There have been cases of misinterpretation of the CPD requirement for trainee solicitors 
where some trainee solicitors had completed 15 CPD points for the 12-month period starting 
from the commencement date of their trainee solicitor contract, instead of completing the 
requisite CPD points for the relevant CPD practice year in accordance with the pro-rata 
requirement listed in Table A above. Trainee solicitors are strongly advised to review Table 
A above to ascertain the number of CPD points they are required to accumulate in each CPD 
practice year.

Example of the calculation of the pro-rata CPD requirement: 
 
A trainee solicitor commenced his trainee solicitor contract on 1 April 2015. His 2 year 
trainee solicitor contract will expire on 31 March 2017. He will need to accumulate 30 CPD 
points by 31 March 2017. 
CPD Requirement : 
 
 
 
1.4.2015 - 31.10.2015 -  9 CPD points (Table A) 
1.11.2015 - 31.10.2016 - 15 CPD points  
1.11.2016 - 31.3.2017 -   6 CPD points 
 
  
              Total      — 
30 CPD points by the end   
  
 
of trainee solicitor contract  
 
In the event of: 
 
(1) 
a suspension of the CPD requirement of a trainee solicitor; 
(2) 
a reduction of the term of a trainee solicitor contract; or 
(3) 
a time gap between two trainee solicitor contracts, 
 
the annual 15 CPD points requirement will be determined on a pro-rata basis in accordance 
with Table A1 below.

Table A1 - Pro-rata requirement for trainee solicitors in special circumstances 
 
 
For trainee solicitors, the obligation to comply with the CPD requirement takes effect from 
the commencement date, not the registration date with the Society, of their trainee solicitor 
contract. 
 
CPD activities undertaken prior to the end of the period of employment as a trainee solicitor 
including the time gap between two trainee solicitor contracts will be counted for CPD 
purposes.

Commencement of practice as a solicitor after the commencement of a CPD 
practice year 
 
Where a solicitor is issued with a practising certificate after the commencement of a CPD 
practice year, the annual 15 CPD points requirement will be pro-rated in accordance with 
Table B on page 7 of this Information Package. 
 
For solicitors, the obligation to comply with the CPD requirement for a CPD practice year 
takes effect from the commencement date of the period of practice stated in their practising 
certificate, not the issue date, of their practising certificate.

Table B - Pro-rata CPD requirement for solicitors 
 
 
Claiming CPD point(s) before admission 
 
Solicitors can claim CPD point(s) for the CPD activities undertaken between the time of 
lodging a current application for admission (Form 4 or Form 1C) with the Society and within 
3 months after the date of admission provided that details of the CPD activities undertaken 
have been entered in the CPD training record.  Any CPD points obtained after the expiry of 3 
months after the date of admission and before the commencement date of the first practising 
certificate of a solicitor will not be counted towards satisfaction of the solicitor’s CPD 
requirement. 
 
Carrying over excess CPD point(s) from one CPD practice year to another     
 
Practitioners will be permitted to carry over a maximum of 10 CPD points accumulated in 
excess of the CPD requirement in one CPD practice year to the next immediately succeeding 
CPD practice year only.

The Law Society of Hong Kong

As an exception to the CPD policy, a practitioner who has completed all requisite modules of 
the RME core courses for principals within the practice year specified under rule 6 of the 
Legal Practitioners (Risk Management Education) Rules (“RME Rules”) will be permitted to 
carry over a maximum of 15 CPD points accumulated in excess of the CPD requirement in 
one CPD practice year to the next immediately succeeding CPD practice year.  
 
Accordingly, if a practitioner has attended other CPD activities in addition to all requisite 
modules of the RME core courses for principals in one CPD practice year, he is permitted to 
carry over up to a maximum of 15 CPD points he obtained during the CPD practice year to 
the next immediately succeeding CPD practice year.  
 
Out of the CPD points permitted to be carried over to satisfy the CPD requirement in the 
succeeding practice year, a maximum of 3 CPD points obtained from completion of RME 
electives may be utilised to satisfy the RME elective requirement for that succeeding practice 
year.  
 
However, any excess CPD points accumulated during employment under the trainee solicitor 
contract cannot be carried over to the CPD practice year in which a trainee solicitor has been 
admitted as a solicitor. 
 
Example 1: 
A partner completed all requisite modules of the RME core courses for 
principals in June 2015 and obtained a total of 24 CPD points. In addition, he 
accumulated 15 CPD points by attendance of a law course (not part of the 
Society’s RME Programme) during the 2014/2015 CPD practice year.  In 
total, the partner obtained 39 CPD points for the 2014/2015 CPD practice 
year. Assuming that the partner’s CPD requirement for the 2014/2015 CPD 
practice year is 15 CPD points, after utilising 15 CPD points out of the 39 
points to satisfy his CPD requirement for the 2014/2015 CPD practice year, he 
can carry forward a maximum of 15 CPD points (out of the balance of 24 CPD 
points) to the next CPD practice year of 2015/2016. 
 
Example 2: 
A solicitor was required to accumulate 15 CPD points in the 2014/2015 CPD 
practice year. During the 2014/2015 CPD practice year, the solicitor did not 
undertake any RME courses.  He accumulated 32 CPD points (i.e. 17 excess 
CPD points) and was thus permitted to carry over 10 CPD points to the next 
CPD practice year, thereby reducing the minimum CPD points which he is 
required to accumulate to fulfil his CPD requirement in the 2015/2016 CPD 
practice year ending 31 October 2016 to 5 CPD points.

WAYS IN WHICH THE CPD REQUIREMENT 
MAY BE MET 
 
Individual training needs vary and the CPD Scheme has been designed to reflect this by 
offering flexibility in the training activities which qualify for CPD point(s). To meet the CPD 
requirement, solicitors and trainee solicitors are free to choose activities relevant to their 
individual training needs. 
 
There are various methods of satisfying the CPD requirement other than attendance at 
traditional lecture-based courses. The methods and the number of CPD point(s) accredited to 
each type of training activity are set out in the Guidelines below. 
 
 
Guidelines for compliance with CPD requirements issued under 
Sections 2 and 5(3) of the CPD Rules  
 
 
Preamble 
 
Members have a general responsibility to keep up to date with developments in the law and 
practice relating to their work. Over and above that general professional responsibility there 
are mandatory CPD requirements which are set out in the CPD Rules.  Details of how these 
requirements may be satisfied are set out below. 
 
The Society recognises certain activities as constituting formal continuing professional 
development.  The Society encourages its members to undertake a wide range of activities 
and to regard acquisition of the prescribed 15 CPD points in each CPD practice year as only a 
minimum requirement.  
 
 
Criteria for accreditation of CPD activities 
 
1. 
The criteria are set out on pages 1 and 2 of this Information Package.  
 
2. 
Approval should be obtained from the Society as to the suitability for accreditation of 
other activities. In such cases, the Society may request that a specific application for 
accreditation of such activity be made.  
 
3. 
Except for Guideline 10 and for applications made under Guidelines 11, 12, 13, 15, 16 
and 17 and in certain cases, Guideline 6, all applications for CPD accreditation 
must be made before the date on which the course is held.  It is not possible to 
accredit CPD points after a course has taken place. (Please refer to page 63 of this 
Information Package.)

for the development of practical skills, courses requiring delegates’ active 
participation, for example, through workshops, will be more effective than 
traditional lecture based courses.  
 
Where at least 1/3 of the tuition time is spent in such small group work, trainee 
solicitors and solicitors may add 25% to the actual time of the course. For 
example, a 4 hours’ workshop comprising 2 hours of small group work 
qualifies for 1 additional CPD point giving a total of 5 CPD points. 
 
4.10 
subject to paragraph 4.11, a course must have a duration of at least one hour. 
Courses of only one hour must have no more than 10 minutes devoted to 
questions from the audience.

½  CPD point provided that for any courses with a lecture format, at 
least 80% of the course must be devoted to lecture presentation. 
 
 
(b)

course, or a designated segment of the course which is discrete from the rest of 
the course and has been accredited on a segmented basis.

(ii) 
access to the course on-line in order for the Society to monitor the 
course; 
(iii) 
evidence that the course is “real time” and interactive; the interactive 
elements include but are not limited to question and answer session(s), 
group work, quizzes and exercises; 
(iv) 
attendance records kept by the course provider demonstrating a

5.3 
In order for a practitioner to obtain CPD point(s) for viewing pre-recorded

a course which only requires a participant to click through a series of 
slides will not qualify for CPD points. Reading and reviewing cases or 
articles does not qualify for CPD points.  
 
 
(iv)

body or any other body approved by the CPD Committee; 
 
(c) 
(i) 
upon the overseas course provider submitting an application for 
accreditation and paying the requisite accreditation fee; or

(d) 
(i) 
upon production of sufficient documentation by the overseas course 
provider to enable the Hong Kong practitioner(s) to demonstrate

in and signed out the attendance at the course); or 
 
(ii) 
upon any Hong Kong practitioner who attended the overseas course 
filing with the Society by the end of the CPD practice year in which he 
attended the course, written confirmation that he attended the entire 
course, or, where he attended part of the course, written confirmation

setting out which parts/sessions of the course he attended and the full 
attendance details for each part/session of his attendance; and 
 
(e) 
applications for accreditation under this Guideline should be made before the 
date of the course. However, where the Society is satisfied that exceptional 
circumstances exist, it may grant retrospective accreditation of an overseas 
course upon application being made by a practitioner (but not a course 
provider), provided that the applicant pays a late accreditation fee and submits 
the application to the Society not later than 30 days after the overseas course 
has been conducted.  However, practitioners should hold no expectation that 
the submission of an application for retrospective accreditation will 
necessarily result in the course being accredited.

COACHING 
 
 
“Coaching” means a structured one-to-one training process conducted face-to-face internally 
in a law firm during which the coach assists an individual practitioner to achieve an 
enhancement of his general legal knowledge and skills (not to achieve an advancement of a 
fee-earning matter). 
 
 
Criteria/Content 
 
Like any other CPD activities, the content of a coaching session must meet the criteria for 
accreditation of CPD activities.  
 
Further, a coaching session must last for at least 30 minutes to qualify for CPD point(s).  
 
To qualify to act as a coach, a practitioner must have a minimum of 5 years of post-admission 
experience in the practice of law and the necessary practical and/or academic skills to assist 
the practitioner being coached to achieve the objectives set for the coaching sessions. 
 
 
Objectives 
 
A coaching session usually involves a more experienced practitioner of a law firm providing 
structured guidance and support to a junior practitioner of the same firm.  
 
The coach and the practitioner being coached should first establish the objectives of the 
coaching session by identifying the training and development needs of the practitioner and 
determining which of those needs and how they will be addressed during the coaching 
session.   
 
A coaching session may form part of a coaching programme which contains a series of 
coaching sessions, but each session should have its own objectives and should be clearly 
documented.     
 
 
Outcome 
 
During each coaching session, the coach is expected to provide structured guidance and 
feedback with a view to assisting the practitioner being coached to achieve the objectives of 
the session. The practitioner being coached should record in writing the development 
outcome following each session for review by the coach.  
 
 
 
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Law Society of Hong Kong 
 
(June 2020) 
  44 
Accreditation 
 
For a law firm which is an accredited course provider of CPD courses, no prior application 
for accreditation of a coaching session held internally within the firm is required.  
 
Where a law firm is not an accredited course provider of CPD courses, prior application for 
accreditation of its coaching programme (at an application fee) is required. It is required to 
submit a detailed outline or plan for the coaching programme setting out: 
 
(a) 
the name of the coach 
(b) 
the professional qualifications and experience of the coach 
(c) 
the name of the practitioner being coached 
(d) 
the venue where the programme is to be held 
(e) 
the overall objectives of the programme  
(f) 
an outline of the programme 
(g) 
the proposed duration of the programme and the duration and frequency of individual 
sessions within the programme. 
 
Any subsequent changes to any approved coaching plan should be notified to the Society. 
 
 
Record 
 
A practitioner wishing to claim CPD point(s) for participation in a coaching session (which 
can either be self-accredited where the law firm is an accredited course provider or be 
accredited by prior application to the Society where the law firm is not an accredited course 
provider) is responsible for keeping his own record of the details of each session of the 
coaching programme for verification by the Society during audit. The details include: 
 
(a) 
the name of the coach 
(b) 
the professional qualifications and experience of the coach 
(c) 
the name of the practitioner being coached 
(d) 
the venue where the session is held 
(e) 
the duration of the session with the date, the start time and the finish time 
(f) 
the number of CPD point(s) claimed for the session 
(g) 
the objectives of the session 
(h) 
an outline of the content of the session 
(i) 
the development outcome of the session. 
 
The record must be signed by the coach and the practitioner being coached.

EXAMPLES OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE 
CPD REQUIREMENT 
 
 
The examples below give an indication of the types of training activities which qualify for 
CPD points and the number of CPD point(s) that may be claimed from each type of training 
activities. 
 
 
Example 1: 
 15 CPD points by attendance at accredited courses 
 
 
 
Example 2: 
 
 10 CPD points by writing legal articles  
 
 
 
PLUS 
 5 CPD points by preparation of accredited course materials 
 
 
 
Example 3:   
 8 CPD points by preparation of course materials 
 
PLUS 
 7 CPD points by presentation of accredited training courses 
 
 
 
Example 4: 
 15 CPD points by undertaking a distance learning course (which involves an 
examination) leading to an LL.M. 
 
 
Preparation and presentation of approved training courses 
 
 
Example 5: 
Presenter A presents a lecture of 50 minutes at a 4 hour CPD course accredited 
with 4 CPD points.  Her actual preparation time was 4 hours supported by 
contemporaneous working papers and results achieved. 
 
CPD points may be awarded to Presenter A as follows: 
 
Presentation time : 50 minutes = 1 hour (rounded up) = 2 CPD points  
PLUS 
Preparation time 
: 4 hours = 4 CPD points but subject to a maximum of 3 
CPD points = 3 CPD points 
TOTAL  
: 5 CPD points 
 
 
 
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Law Society of Hong Kong 
 
(June 2020) 
  46 
Example 6:  
Presenter B presents a lecture of 1 hour 15 minutes at a 3 hour CPD course 
accredited with 3 CPD points.  His actual preparation time was 5½  hours 
supported by contemporaneous working papers and results achieved. 
 
CPD points may be awarded to Presenter B as follows: 
 
Presentation time  : 1¼  hours = 1½  hours (rounded up) = 3 CPD points 
PLUS 
Preparation time 
: 5½  hours = 5½  CPD points but subject to a maximum of 
4½  CPD points = 4½  CPD points 
 
TOTAL 
: 7½  CPD points 
 
 
Example 7: 
  
 
(a) 
Presenter C presents a lecture of 2 hours at a 3 hour CPD course accredited 
with 3 CPD points.  His actual preparation time was 10 hours supported by 
contemporaneous working papers and results achieved. 
 
CPD points may be awarded to Presenter C as follows: 
 
Presentation time  : 2 hours = 4 CPD points 
PLUS 
Preparation time : 10 hours = 10 CPD points but subject to a maximum of 6 
CPD points = 6 CPD points 
TOTAL 
: 10 CPD points 
 
(b) 
Presenter C remains in attendance for the entire 3 hours of the course (that is, 
one hour in addition to his actual presentation time).  He is entitled to claim an 
additional 1 CPD point for his attendance bringing the number of CPD points 
which he may claim to 11 CPD points. 
 
 
Example 8:   
A trainee solicitor assisted Presenter C in the preparation for the course by 
spending 7 hours of actual preparation supported by contemporaneous working 
papers and results achieved.  He will be entitled to claim up to 6 CPD points 
for such preparation (that is, 3 times the actual presentation time (2 hours) of 
Presenter C).

SUSPENSION OF THE CPD REQUIREMENT 
 
What is a suspension of the CPD requirement? 
 
Solicitors who are holding current practising certificates but who are not in practice as a 
solicitor, and trainee solicitors who are employed as a trainee solicitor outside Hong Kong, 
for any period not shorter than 70 days may apply to suspend the CPD requirement for such 
period. During that period they are not required to undertake any CPD activities.  Any CPD 
activity undertaken during the suspension period will not be counted for CPD purposes. 
 
In order to apply for a suspension of the CPD requirement, the period of absence from 
practice in Hong Kong must relate to any one period running continuously for 70 days or 
more.  An aggregate of various periods of absences during the year each lasting for less than 
70 days but totaling 70 days or more will not entitle a solicitor or a trainee solicitor to a 
suspension.  
 
 
Who can suspend the CPD requirement? 
 
The CPD Rules only apply to trainee solicitors and solicitors holding a current practising 
certificate. It is therefore unnecessary for solicitors to apply for a CPD suspension for the 
period during which they do not hold a practising certificate.  
 
Solicitors must make an application to the Society to suspend the CPD requirement if they 
are: 
 
1. Not in practice as a solicitor. This would apply, where, despite holding a current 
practising certificate, a solicitor: 
(i) 
is unemployed  
(ii) is on maternity leave, or 
(iii) is not required to act as a solicitor.  
 
2. In practice outside Hong Kong. This would apply where a solicitor is out of 
practice due to working abroad. 
 
3. Absent from work as a result of illness. This would apply where the solicitor is 
absent from practice due to long term illness.  
  
Trainee solicitors must make an application to the Society to suspend the CPD requirement 
if they are: 
 
1. Employed as a trainee solicitor outside Hong Kong. This would apply only if it 
is for a period permitted by the Society. 
 
2. Absent from work as a result of illness. This would apply where a trainee 
solicitor is absent from work due to long term illness. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Law Society of Hong Kong 
 
(June 2020) 
  48 
What must practitioners do in order to obtain a CPD suspension? 
 
Practitioners must make an application to the Society for a suspension of their CPD 
requirement. Applications should be directed to the Assistant Director, Professional 
Development. The Society may require the practitioner to submit a statutory declaration in 
support of the application.  When any suspension is granted, the Society will confirm the 
number of CPD point(s) outstanding for that CPD practice year at the date of CPD 
suspension. 
 
It should be noted that if a practitioner: 
 
(a) 
Applies for and is granted a CPD suspension, any training undertaken during 
the suspension will not be counted towards the CPD requirement on return to 
practice or employment. 
 
(b) 
Does not apply for a suspension, he may be required to meet the CPD 
requirement in full for that period.  
 
Practitioners should enter in their CPD training record the date that any CPD suspension was 
granted by the Society, the dates the CPD suspension commenced and concluded and the 
reason for the CPD suspension. 
 
 
Circumstances under which a CPD suspension granted may be void and/or 
ineffective 
 
The CPD suspension granted to solicitors and trainee solicitors will become void and 
ineffective under the following circumstances: 
 
(a) 
where a solicitor or trainee solicitor has been granted a CPD suspension on the basis 
that the solicitor or trainee solicitor will be absent from practice or employment for 70 
days or more; and the solicitor or trainee solicitor returns to practice or employment in 
Hong Kong before the expiry of the 70 days; 
 
(b) 
where a solicitor has been granted CPD suspension and during the CPD suspension, the 
practising certificate of the solicitor expires; the solicitor does not renew his practising 
certificate and the period commencing from the effective date of the CPD suspension 
to the date of expiry of the practising certificate of the solicitor is less than 70 days. 
 
Example 1  
 
A solicitor was granted a CPD suspension effective from 5 February 2014 on the basis that he 
would be out of Hong Kong for more than 70 days from 5 February 2014. However, he 
resumed practice as a solicitor in Hong Kong on 1 April 2014.  The CPD suspension granted 
to him became void and ineffective because there were less than 70 days between 5 February 
and 31 March 2014, the day prior to his resumption of practice. 
 
 
 
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Law Society of Hong Kong 
 
(June 2020) 
  49 
Example 2  
 
A solicitor was granted a CPD suspension effective from 28 October 2014. He did not apply 
to renew his practising certificate when it expired on 31 December 2014. As solicitors are 
only subject to the CPD Rules if they hold a current practising certificate, and the solicitor 
has not held a practising certificate since 1 January 2015, the solicitor is not entitled to claim 
any CPD suspension from 1 January 2015. The CPD suspension granted to him from 28 
October 2014 became void and ineffective as there were less than 70 days between 28 
October and 31 December 2014, the expiry date of his 2014 practising certificate. 
 
 
The CPD requirement for practitioners returning to work  
 
A practitioner's CPD requirement on return to work will depend on how many CPD point(s) 
he has accrued before the suspension began, how many CPD point(s) will be required after 
the resumption of work and whether any excess point(s) may be carried over. 
 
 
Determination of a practitioner's CPD requirement on return to work  
 
A practitioner's CPD requirement will be determined by adding together a pro-rata of the 
annual CPD point(s) that were required to be undertaken up to the date of his CPD 
suspension (in accordance with Table C or Table D on pages 49 and 50 as the case may be), 
with a pro-rata of the annual CPD point(s) that will be required from the date of his return to 
practice or employment to the end of the CPD practice year (in accordance with Table E on 
page 50), taking into account any excess point(s) permissible. 
 
Table C applies where a practitioner’s CPD requirement arise from 1 November in the CPD 
practice year.  However, where a practitioner comes within the ambit of the CPD Scheme 
after the commencement of the CPD practice year and is granted a suspension later in the 
same year, Table D applies. 
 
Any enquiries should be directed to the Assistant Director, Professional Development on 
2846-0521 or e-mail to adpd@hklawsoc.org.hk

CPD TRAINING RECORD 
 
 
The Society does not keep records of individual practitioners’ attendance at courses. All 
practitioners subject to the CPD Scheme are required to maintain their own record of their 
training activities with sufficient details for verification purposes.  A recommended CPD 
training record form can be downloaded from the Society’s website at www.hklawsoc.org.hk.  
 
The Society can request production of the training record at any time. 
 
Many firms keep duplicate training records.  However, solicitors are reminded that the onus 
is on the individual to maintain the training record.  Practitioners who are unable to produce 
the training record may be required to undertake the training again.  
 
Practitioners should ensure that all the relevant details of all CPD courses or activities 
undertaken are entered onto the CPD training record. 
 
NOTE:  CPD training records should be retained for at least two (2) CPD practice years 
after the period to which it relates.  In any event, the CPD training record for the CPD 
practice year in which a practitioner last engaged in practice must also be retained as 
supporting evidence for his statement of CPD compliance should he later resume his 
practice and apply for renewal of his practising certificate.  If any of the CPD points 
recorded in the training record involve CPD point(s) carried over from the preceding 
CPD practice years, the CPD training records for all relevant years should also be 
retained as supporting evidence for audit purposes.

ATTENDANCE AT ACCREDITED CPD COURSES 
 
 
Attendance policy 
 
With effect from 1 November 2008, a practitioner should not claim any CPD points if he is 
absent from the course (excluding scheduled breaks) for more than 10 minutes for a course of 
less than 3 hours or for more than 30 minutes for a course of 3 hours or more in duration. 
 
 
The following attendance policy applied until 31 October 2008:  
 
(a) 
For a course of less than 60 minutes in duration, any course participants who is absent 
for any period during the course, including late arrivals or early departures, will not 
receive any CPD points for that course. 
 
(b) 
For a course of 60 minutes or more in duration, a grace period of 10 minutes for either 
late arrival or early departure (but not both in the same course) will be permitted 
without deduction of any CPD points.  Any course participant who is otherwise absent 
during the course apart from scheduled breaks will not receive any CPD points for 
that course.  
 
(c) 
For a course of 3 hours or more but less than 6 hours in duration,   
 
(i) 
1 CPD point will be deducted for any late arrival or early departure beyond the 
10 minutes’ grace period of up to 30 minutes from the commencement of the 
course; 
 
(ii) 
any course participant who arrives late or leaves early for more than 30 
minutes or who is otherwise absent during the course apart from scheduled 
breaks will not receive any CPD points for that course. 
 
(d) 
For a course of 6 hours or more in duration,   
 
(i) 
1 CPD point will be deducted for any late arrival or early departure beyond the 
10 minutes’ grace period of up to 30 minutes from the commencement or 
before the end of the course; 
 
(ii) 
2 CPD points will be deducted for any late arrival or early departure beyond 
the 10 minutes’ grace period of more than 30 minutes and up to 60 minutes 
from the commencement or before the end of the course; 
 
(iii) 
any course participant who arrives late or leaves early for more than 60 
minutes or who is otherwise absent during the course apart from scheduled 
breaks will not receive any CPD points for that course. 
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Law Society of Hong Kong 
 
(June 2020) 
  55 
Where a course participant both arrives late and leaves early in the same course, the grace 
period or partial award of CPD points will not apply. In such cases, no CPD points will be 
awarded for attendance at that course.    
 
Where courses last for more than one day and have been accredited as a whole (i.e. not on a 
segmented basis), the attendance policy will apply on a day-to-day basis. 
 
When attending courses, practitioners should notify the provider that they will claim CPD 
points and should make sure that their attendance at the entire course is noted (e.g. by 
scanning membership cards where there is a computerised scanning system, or by signing in 
and signing out of the course where such a system is not implemented.)

  56 
SEGMENTED ACCREDITATION OF CPD COURSES 
 
 
Attendance at all segments and days (as the case may be) of a CPD course of one or more 
days in duration is necessary in order to obtain CPD point(s). No CPD points will be awarded 
for partial attendance, except in the circumstances outlined in the attendance policy and in 
this section. 
 
Where courses last for more than one day and have been accredited as a whole (i.e. not on a 
segmented basis), the attendance policy will apply on a day-to-day basis. 
 
Members are reminded to check with the course provider about the number of CPD point(s) 
that have been granted by the CPD Accreditation Sub-Committee to a course of one or more 
days in duration. 
 
Accreditation of a programme on a segmented basis will be granted by the CPD 
Accreditation Sub-Committee only where it is appropriate to do so, that is, where the various 
sessions/segments of the course are discrete, and where segmented accreditation will not 
detract from the educational value of the course. 
 
Where the course provider has applied successfully to the CPD Accreditation Sub-Committee 
for accreditation of individual segments or days of a course of one or more days in duration, 
solicitors and trainee solicitors attending an accredited segment(s) or day(s) of the course in 
full will be entitled to claim the CPD point(s) accredited to that segment(s) or day(s). Where 
solicitors and trainee solicitors attend a few segments, the duration of all the segments 
attended will be aggregated before the CPD points accredited are rounded down to the nearest 
half point.  
 
 
Claiming CPD points for attending a segmented course 
 
A conference has been accredited on a segmented basis. The conference has 4 sessions. 
 
Sessions:  
 
Duration: 
 
Session I

Session IV 
 
3 hours 15 minutes  
 
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Law Society of Hong Kong 
 
(June 2020) 
  57 
Example 1: 
 
A practitioner who has attended Sessions I, II, III and IV may claim the following: 
 
Total duration of attendance:  
 
45 minutes + 1 hour 45 minutes + 1 hour 30 minutes + 3 hours 15 minutes  
= 7 hours 15 minutes 
 
Total number of CPD points obtained:  7 CPD points (rounded down to the nearest half point) 
 
 
Example 2: 
 
A practitioner who has attended Sessions I and III may claim the following: 
 
Total duration of attendance:  
 
45 minutes + 1 hour 30 minutes = 2 hours 15 minutes 
 
Total number of CPD points obtained:  2 CPD points (rounded down to the nearest half point) 
 
 
Where courses have been accredited on a segmented basis, the attendance policies are: 
 
(a) 
a practitioner cannot claim any CPD points in respect of a segment of less than 3 
hours where he is absent (excluding any scheduled breaks) from that segment for 
more than 10 minutes;   
 
(b) 
 a practitioner cannot claim any CPD points in respect of a segment of 3 hours or more 
where he is absent (excluding any scheduled breaks) from that segment for more than 
30 minutes. 
 
 
Example 3: 
 
A practitioner who has attended Sessions I, II, III and IV but was late for Session I for 15 
minutes, he is not eligible to claim any CPD point for Session I. He may claim the following 
CPD points for his attendance at Sessions II, III and IV only: 
 
Total duration of attendance:  
 
1 hour 45 minutes + 1 hour 30 minutes + 3 hours 15 minutes = 6 hours 30 minutes 
 
Total number of CPD points obtained: 6.5 CPD points

EXEMPTION FROM THE CPD REQUIREMENT 
 
 
As the CPD Scheme is an ongoing requirement for those practitioners coming within it, the 
system of exemptions that applied under the CLE Scheme (which had application to a limited 
category of practitioners and for only a limited period) has no relevance under the CPD 
Scheme. 
 
The granting of exemptions from the operation of the CPD Scheme will be considered on a 
case-by-case basis only where exceptional circumstances exist. An exemption may be granted 
where it is fair and reasonable to do so. 
 
Since 1 January 2003, the following exemption policy has been in force: 
 
Upon an application being made to the Society, an exemption from compliance with the 
annual CPD requirement may be provided to a solicitor who meets all of the following 
criteria: 
 
(a) 
he has been in practice as a solicitor for a period of 40 years or more, or he is over 70 
years old; 
 
(b) 
he gives an undertaking to the Society that he is not in active practice; and 
 
(c) 
he undertakes to notify the Society immediately if circumstances in relation to 
paragraph (b) change. 
 
For the purposes of this policy only, a solicitor will not be regarded as being in “active 
practice” if the only activities that he engages in as a solicitor are: 
 
(1) 
administering oaths; and/or 
(2) 
taking affidavits or declarations; and/or 
(3) 
certifying documents. 
 
Applications should be directed to the Assistant Director, Professional Development.

MONITORING COMPLIANCE WITH THE MANDATORY 
CPD REQUIREMENT 
 
 
1. 
A solicitor will be required, at the time of applying for renewal of his practising 
certificate (usually in November), to make a statement of compliance that he has 
complied with the CPD requirement for the preceding CPD practice year. 
 
A trainee solicitor will be required to make a declaration in his Form 4 Application 
for a Certificate of Eligibility for Admission that he has complied with the 
requirement of the CPD Scheme. 
  
A false or incorrect statement may constitute professional misconduct and may lead to 
disciplinary actions. 
 
2. 
The Society may conduct random checks to ensure compliance with mandatory CPD 
requirements.  
 
The Society may: 
 
 request sight of a practitioner’s CPD training record at any time; 
 
 require a practitioner to produce such information relating to his participation in 
the CPD Scheme as may be specified; and  
 
 require a practitioner to attend the Society in person and furnish such additional 
evidence as to participation in the CPD Scheme as may be required. 
 
All practitioners must keep their CPD training record for 2 CPD practice years after 
the period to which it relates for auditing purposes. If the CPD points recorded 
involve CPD point(s) carried over from previous CPD practice years, the CPD 
training records for the relevant CPD practice years must also be retained as 
supporting evidence for audit purposes.

FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THE CPD 
REQUIREMENT 
 
The Council has the power under section 6 of the Legal Practitioners Ordinance to refuse to 
issue a practising certificate to an applicant who has not complied with the CPD Rules, or to 
suspend or cancel the practising certificate of a solicitor. 
 
The Council’s policy in the event of failure to comply with the CPD requirement ascertained 
during: 
 
General Audit: 
 
In the absence of acceptable mitigating factors, solicitors who did not acquire the necessary 
CPD points for the preceding CPD practice year shall, unless the outstanding CPD point(s) 
was subsequently acquired by a deadline specified by the Society, be subject to suspension or 
cancellation of their current practising certificate.  
 
Practising Certificate Applications: 
 
1. 
In the absence of acceptable mitigating factors, the Council may refuse to issue a 
practising certificate to a solicitor who fails to acquire the necessary CPD point(s) by  
15 December pursuant to its powers under section 6 (5)(d) of the Legal Practitioners 
Ordinance.  
 
2. 
Applications for renewal of practising certificates by solicitors who had not acquired 
the necessary CPD point(s) by 31 October, but did acquire the necessary CPD point(s) 
by 15 December, will be processed in the usual way.   
 
3. 
Failure by a solicitor to acquire the necessary CPD point(s) by the end of a CPD 
practice year may be referred to the Conduct Section of the Compliance Department 
of the Society for investigation. 
 
Breaches of the CPD requirement  
 
Breaches of the CPD requirement are regarded by the Council as professional misconduct. 
Mitigating factors will be taken into account in assessing individual cases.  Serious cases will 
be referred to a Disciplinary Tribunal. Sanctions by the Disciplinary Tribunal may involve 
imposition of a fine, censure, suspension or striking off of solicitors, and cancellation or 
suspension of a trainee solicitor contract.  
 
Form 4 declaration of compliance by trainee solicitors 
 
In addition to complying with the requirement to acquire 15 CPD points (or a pro-rata as 
applicable) during a CPD practice year, a trainee solicitor is required to have accumulated 30 
CPD points by the end of his period of employment as a trainee solicitor. Trainee solicitors 
must declare in the Form 4 Application for a Certificate of Eligibility for Admission that they 
have accumulated the number of CPD points that is required by section 5 of the CPD Rules to 
be accumulated by the end of their period of employment as a trainee solicitor.

Any failure to comply with section 5 of the CPD Rules by trainee solicitors (including failure 
to comply with the pro-rata acquisition of CPD points during each CPD practice year of the 
trainee solicitor contract) may be referred to the Conduct Section of the Compliance 
Department of the Society for investigation.

COURSE AND PROVIDER ACCREDITATION 
 
1. 
Application 
 
In order for a course to be awarded with CPD point(s), a separate application for 
accreditation of each course must be made by the provider of the course to the CPD 
Accreditation Sub-Committee. The application must be made on the Society's 
standard form and sent to the Assistant Director, Professional Development at least 4 
weeks before the scheduled date of the course. If the application is incomplete, 
accreditation may take 4 weeks from the date of submission of the complete 
application. 
 
All changes to the information submitted to the Society in relation to an application 
for CPD course accreditation shall be notified to the Society as soon as the changes 
are made and in any event prior to the commencement of the course. 
 
 
2. 
No Retrospective Accreditation 
 
It is not possible to accredit CPD point(s) after any course has taken place.  However, 
in exceptional circumstances, the Society may accredit an overseas course on a 
retrospective basis, subject to certain conditions. Please refer to Guideline 6 on page 
11 and page 12 of this Information Package for details. 
 
 
3. 
Documents and Information Required on Application for Course Accreditation 
 
(a) 
a detailed outline of what will be covered in the course and by whom;  
 
(b) 
a programme showing the sequence of speakers, the method(s) of teaching, 
e.g. lecture, participatory case study, role-play, discussion, question and 
answer, and the amount of time which each speaker will spend on each area; 
 
(c) 
an outline of the course materials which will be provided to participants; and 
 
(d) 
a brief up-to-date resume of each speaker's professional qualifications, legal 
background and any teaching experience which they each have.   
 
 
4. 
Honour-based CPD Scheme 
 
(a) 
Course providers should note the Society’s introduction of an honour-based 
CPD Scheme with effect from 1 November 2008 as set out on page 2 of this 
Information Package.  
 
(b) 
Under the honour-based CPD Scheme, the scanning system becomes optional. 
Unless the Society has made a specific request, course providers are no longer 
required to submit the attendance records of each accredited course to the 
Society within 7 days of the course. 
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Law Society of Hong Kong 
 
(June 2020) 
  64 
(c) 
Course providers are required to keep the attendance record of an accredited 
CPD course for 4 CPD practice years from the end of the CPD practice 
year during which the course is held. 
 
(d) 
The attendance record kept by a course provider may be in any form as 
decided by the course provider on condition that it is sufficiently clear to 
support the entitlement to the number of CPD point(s) claimed by a participant 
for his attendance.   
 
(e) 
A participant shall not be entitled to claim any CPD point(s) if he is absent 
from the course (excluding scheduled breaks) for more than 10 minutes for a 
course of less than 3 hours or for more than 30 minutes for a course of 3 hours 
or more.   
 
(f) 
By way of reference, the Society as a course provider will no longer record 
attendance by scanning. Instead, attendees will be required to register their 
attendance upon arrival at the venue by production of their Law Society 
membership card or Hong Kong identity card.   
 
5. 
Administrative Matters 
 
(a) 
Course providers should note the attendance policy and policy on segmented 
accreditation of CPD courses contained in pages 54 to 58 of this Information 
Package. 
 
The requirement for course providers to submit all computerised attendance 
records generated from a computerised scanning system in respect of an 
accredited course to the Assistant Director, Professional Development within 7 
days of the course in order for the participants to gain their CPD points 
applied until 31 October 2008.  Upon the implementation of the honour-based 
CPD Scheme on 1 November 2008, the scanning system has become optional. 
Unless the Society has made a specific request, course providers are no longer 
required to submit the attendance records of each accredited course to the 
Society within 7 days of the course.  
 
(b) 
All accredited courses must be evaluated by participants attending the course 
in a manner approved by the Society. 
 
(c) 
Course providers shall promptly submit a full set of course materials to the 
Society upon request by the Society at any time after application for 
accreditation has been submitted or within a reasonable period after the course 
is held. 
 
A summary of evaluation forms must be forwarded to the Assistant Director, 
Professional Development within 7 days of the course. 
 
(d) 
Course providers must carefully monitor the delivery of the course.  If the 
course finishes more than 30 minutes before its scheduled finish time, ½  CPD 
point will be deducted for every half hour.   
 
 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Law Society of Hong Kong 
 
(June 2020) 
  65 
 
By way of example, take the case of a course which started at 9:30 a.m., was 
scheduled to finish at 12:45 p.m. and was accredited with 3 CPD points: 
 
(i) 
If it finished at 12:30 p.m., i.e. 15 minutes before the scheduled finish 
time, no CPD points will be deducted. Participants who had not been 
late for more than 10 minutes and who stayed until the course ended at 
12:30 p.m. would be awarded with 3 CPD points. 
  
(ii) 
If it finished at 12 noon, i.e. 45 minutes before the scheduled finish 
time, on the basis of the shortened duration of the course, ½  CPD point 
will be deducted. 
 
(e) 
(i) 
Course providers are required to state clearly in their CPD course 
promotional materials: 
 
 
 the course objectives; 
 the course coverage; 
 the intended learning outcomes; 
 the target audience and the level of prior knowledge / experience 
assumed; and      
 a description of the presenters’ areas of practice. 
 
(ii) 
Course providers are required to ensure that presenters of the same 
course do communicate with each other to discuss how the course is to 
be conducted and that steps be taken to ensure that the course 
information on the promotional materials are accurate and reflect truly 
how the course is to be conducted. 
 
(f) 
A demerit points system is in place to promote quality control and efficient 
administration of CPD courses by accredited course providers.  (Please refer to 
pages 67 to 68 of this Information Package for details.)  The performance of 
course providers including any irregularities in the conduct of accredited 
courses will be taken into account when their accredited course provider status 
is reviewed annually.   
 
 (g) 
A course number will be generated and given to a course provider once a 
course has been accredited with CPD point(s).  Course providers should not 
assume that a course will be accredited with CPD point(s) unless and until 
they receive, from the Society, the respective course number and/or a 
confirmation of the number of CPD point(s) accredited to the course. 
 
 
6. 
Prescribed Fee  
 
A fee will be charged on course-by-course accreditation of CPD courses.  The rates 
vary for commercial and non-commercial providers. Course providers may be 
requested to produce a copy of their constitutional document to confirm the applicable 
rate of prescribed fee.

7. 
Provider Accreditation 
 
The Society is also implementing an accreditation scheme for organisations. In order 
to be considered for Provider Accreditation, it will be necessary for an organisation 
to: 
 
(a) 
have established a suitable track record of 
 
(i) 
obtaining individual course accreditation for CPD courses; 
 
(ii) 
providing a reasonable number of accredited courses over a reasonable 
period (usually at least 10 hours of courses over 12 months); and 
 
(iii) 
compliance 
with 
course-by-course 
accreditation 
criteria 
and 
conditions. 
 
(b) 
have a suitable training infrastructure; and 
 
(c) 
have a general favourable assessment of the accredited courses by the 
participants. 
 
The number of courses held by an accredited course provider is a factor which will be 
taken into account when considering an application for renewal of its accredited 
course provider status. The general guideline is that an accredited course provider 
should hold at least 10 hours of courses in a CPD practice year.         
 
 
8. 
Monitoring of Accredited Courses by the Society’s Representatives 
 
Course providers shall permit any person nominated by the Society to attend any CPD 
courses free of charge for the purpose of monitoring the CPD course to ensure the  
course provider’s compliance with the Guidelines and Rules as set out in this 
Information Package. 
 
 
Any enquiries on course accreditation should be directed to the Assistant Director, 
Professional Development on 2846-0521 or e-mail to adpd@hklawsoc.org.hk.

DEMERIT POINTS SYSTEM 
 
(Reference: Course and Provider Accreditation paragraph 5(f) on page 65) 
 
1. 
The Demerit Points System is aimed at promoting quality control and efficient 
administration of CPD courses by accredited course providers. 
 
2. 
Failure to comply with the terms and conditions of CPD course provider accreditation 
will attract Demerit Point(s). A list of items together with the Demerit Point(s) that 
they attract are set out on page 68.  The Society may include more items in the list 
from time to time.   
 
3. 
Upon discovery of any alleged non-compliance, the Society will inform the course 
provider the number of Demerit Point(s) incurred by the course provider for that item 
together with the number of Demerit Point(s) the course provider has incurred within 
the 12 months preceding the date of notification. If the total number of Demerit Points 
reaches 5 or more, the accredited course provider status may be suspended for a 
period to be determined by the CPD Accreditation Sub-Committee.  Any suspension 
shall not take effect until at least 3 months after written notification has been sent to 
the course provider.  A suspension of the accredited course provider status has the 
effect that all applications for accreditation of courses during the period of suspension 
will have to be submitted on a course-by-course basis at least 4 weeks in advance of 
the scheduled date of the course together with all supporting documents and the 
prescribed fee. 
 
4. 
All Demerit Points which result in a suspension of the accredited course provider 
status will be spent. 
 
5. 
The Demerit Points System shall operate without prejudice to the general power of 
the CPD Accreditation Sub-Committee to take into account all irregularities when it 
reviews the accredited course provider status of an accredited course provider. 
 
6. 
A course provider aggrieved by a decision of the CPD Accreditation Sub-Committee 
may apply in writing to the Standing Committee on Standards and Development for a 
review of the decision within one month of the date of notification of the decision.
