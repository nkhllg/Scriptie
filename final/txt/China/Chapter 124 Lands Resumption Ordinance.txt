Principles of assessment of compensation
(1)
When  any  property  is  resumed,  the  Lands  Tribunal  in
determining the compensation to be paid and in estimating the
value  of  the  land  resumed  and  of  any  buildings  thereon,
may —  (Amended 28 of 1911 s. 6(i); 50 of 1911; 1 of 1912
Schedule)
(a)
take into consideration the nature and existing condition
of  the  property,  and  the  probable  duration  of  the
buildings in their existing state, and the state of repair
thereof; and
(b)
decline to make any compensation for any addition to or
improvement of the property made after the date of the
publication in the Gazette of the notice under section
4(1) (unless such addition or improvement was necessary
for the maintenance of the property in a proper state of
repair): (Amended 27 of 1937 Schedule; 25 of 2023 s. 12)
Hong Kong e-Legislation - Print Selected Documents

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Provided that, in the case of any interest acquired after the date
of such publication, no separate estimate of the value of the
interest  is  to  be  made  so  as  to  increase  the  amount  of
compensation. (Amended 25 of 2023 s. 12)
(2)
The  Lands  Tribunal  may  also  receive  evidence  to
prove —  (Amended 28 of 1911 s. 6 (i))
(a)
that the rental of the buildings or premises was enhanced
by reason of the same being used as a brothel, or as a
gaming house, or for any illegal purpose; or
(b)
that the buildings or premises are in such a condition as
to be a nuisance within the meaning of any Ordinance
relating to buildings or to public health, or are not in
reasonably good repair; or (Amended 50 of 1911; 51 of
1911; 1 of 1912 Schedule; 2 of 1912 Schedule; 20 of 
1948 s. 4)
(c)
that  the  buildings  or  premises  are  unfit,  and  not
reasonably  capable  of  being  made  fit,  for  human
habitation. (Amended 51 of 1911; 2 of 1912 Schedule)
(3)
If the Lands Tribunal is satisfied by such evidence, then the
compensation—
(a)
shall, in the first case, so far as it is based on rental, be
based on the rental which would have been obtainable if
the building or premises had not been occupied as a
brothel, or as a gaming house, or for an illegal purpose;
and (Amended 51 of 1911; 2 of 1912 Schedule)
(b)
shall, in the second case, be the amount estimated as the
value of the building or premises if the nuisance had
been abated or if they had been put into reasonably good
repair, after deducting the estimated expense of abating
the nuisance or putting them into such repair, as the case
may be; and (Amended 50 of 1911; 51 of 1911; 1 of 1912
Schedule; 2 of 1912 Schedule)
(c)
shall, in the third case, be the value of the land and of the
materials of the buildings thereon.

no allowance shall be made on account of the resumption
being compulsory;
(aa)
no account shall be taken of the fact that the land lies
within or is affected by any area, zone or district reserved

The application must be made before the expiry of—
(a)
a period of 1 year from the date on which the resumed
land reverts to the Government under section 5; or
(b)
a further period allowed by the Chief Executive in a
particular case.
(3)
On  the  application,  the  Chief  Executive  may  order  the
resumption of the relevant land, whether or not the resumption
is required for a public purpose, if the Chief Executive is of
the opinion that—

the resumed land is reasonably necessary to the use and
enjoyment of the relevant land; and
(b)
it would be just and equitable to make an order for the
relevant land to be resumed.

without stating the particular purpose for which the land is required;
and a notice containing such statement is conclusive evidence that
the resumption is for a public purpose.
