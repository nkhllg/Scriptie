Chapter 314
Occupiers Liability Ordinance
20/09/2018
5.
Landlord’s liability in virtue of obligation to repair
(1)
Where premises are occupied by any person under a tenancy
which puts on the landlord an obligation to that person for the
maintenance or repair of the premises, the landlord shall owe
to all persons who or whose goods may from time to time be
lawfully on the premises the same duty, in respect of dangers
arising from any default by him in carrying out that obligation,
as if he were an occupier of the premises and those persons or
their goods were there by his invitation or permission (but
without any contract).
(2)
Where premises are occupied under a sub-tenancy, subsection
(1) shall apply to any landlord of the premises (whether the
immediate or a superior landlord) on whom an obligation to
the occupier for the maintenance or repair of the premises is
put by the sub-tenancy, and for that purpose any obligation to
the occupier which the sub-tenancy puts on a mesne landlord
of the premises, or is treated by virtue of this provision as
putting on a mesne landlord, shall be treated as put by it also
on any landlord on whom the mesne landlord’s tenancy puts
the like obligation towards the mesne landlord.
(3)
For the purposes of this section, where premises comprised in
a tenancy (whether occupied under that tenancy or under a
sub-tenancy) are put to a use not permitted by the tenancy, and
the landlord of whom they are held under the tenancy is not
debarred by his acquiescence or otherwise from objecting or
from enforcing his objection, then no persons or goods whose
presence on the premises is due solely to that use of the
premises shall be deemed to be lawfully on the premises as
regards that landlord or any superior landlord of the premises,
whether or not they are lawfully there as regards an inferior
landlord.
(4)
For  the  purposes  of  this  section,  a  landlord  shall  not  be
deemed to have made default in carrying out any obligation to
the occupier of the premises unless his default is such as to be
actionable at the suit of the occupier or, in the case of a
superior landlord whose actual obligation is to an inferior
landlord,  his  default  in  carrying  out  that  obligation  is
actionable at the suit of the inferior landlord.
(5)
This section shall not put a landlord of premises under a
greater duty than the occupier to persons who or whose goods
are lawfully on the premises by reason only of the exercise of
a right of way.
(6)
Nothing in this section shall relieve a landlord of any duty
which he is under apart from this section.
(7)
For the purposes of this section, obligations imposed by any
enactment in virtue of a tenancy shall be treated as imposed by
the tenancy, and tenancy (租) includes a statutory tenancy
which does not in law amount to a tenancy, and includes also
any contract conferring a right of occupation, and landlord (業
主) shall be construed accordingly.
(8)
This  section  applies  to  tenancies  created  before  the
commencement of this Ordinance, as well as to those created
after its commencement.
