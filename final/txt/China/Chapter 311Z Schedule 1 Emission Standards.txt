Interpretation
In this Schedule‚Äî
CO means carbon monoxide;
compression-ignition engine (Âºè) means an engine in
which the fuel is injected into the cylinders or combustion
space of the engine and is there ignited during normal running
solely by the heat of compression of the cylinder charge;
Council (ÁêÜ‰∫ã) means the Council of the European Communities
(now known as the Council of the European Union);
design weight (	
ÈáçÈáè), in relation to a particular motor vehicle,
means  the  maximum  design  loaded  vehicle  weight
recommended by its manufacturer for motor vehicles of the
same class or description as the particular vehicle; (L.N. 173 of
2018)
direct-injection type (Âô¥Âûã), in relation to an engine, means a
type of engine in which the fuel is injected directly into the
combustion space above the piston crown; (L.N. 173 of 2018)
g/kWh (ÂÖã/ÂçÉ‚Ω°‚º©ÊôÇ) means gram per kilowatt-hour;
HC means hydrocarbons;
indirect-injection type (Âô¥Âûã), in relation to an engine, means a
type of engine in which the fuel is not injected directly into the
combustion space above the piston crown; (L.N. 173 of 2018)
kW means kilowatt;
NMHC means non-methane hydrocarbons;
NOx means oxides of nitrogen;
PM means particulate matter;
positive-ignition engine  (  Âà∂  Âºè  )  means  an  engine
operating on the Otto cycle in which a mixture of fuel and air
is  drawn  into  cylinders  and  ignited  after  compression  by
means  of  an  electric  spark  applied  at  a  known  and  pre-
determined moment of the cycle;
ppm means parts per million;
smoke () means smoke level expressed in percentage opacity.
