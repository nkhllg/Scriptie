(a) carries out any development of the land in contravention of
section 12(1); or
(b) carries out any works within a conservation area on the

the owner of the land is taken to have permitted the carrying out of the
development, or permitted the carrying out of those works, as the case
may be, in contravention of the same provision.
[7/2017]
(2) However, it is a defence in proceedings against an owner of any
land for an offence under section 12(4) for such a contravention if it is

defendant —

all
reasonable
precautions

prevent
the

the contravention by the tenant or contractor.
