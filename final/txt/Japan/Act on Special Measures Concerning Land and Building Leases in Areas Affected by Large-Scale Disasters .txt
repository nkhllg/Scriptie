right (meaning the land leasehold right as defined in Article 2, item (i) of the 
Act on Land and Building Leases; the same applies hereinafter) has been lost 
due to a specified large-scale disaster (excluding the cases referred to in Article 
8, paragraph (1) of that Act), the land leasehold right holder may request the

for the permission.

the relationship between the land sublease right holder (meaning the land 
sublease right holder as defined in Article 2, item (v) of the Act on Land and 
Building Leases; the same applies in the following Article) and the lessor if a 
land sublease right (meaning the land sublease right as defined in item (iv) of 
that Article) has been established; provided, however, that when the lessor

right holder must be obtained.
