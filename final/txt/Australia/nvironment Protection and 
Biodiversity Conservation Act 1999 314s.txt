EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 
This Heritage Management Plan (HMP) for West Block and the Dugout (generally referred to here as 
West Block) at Block 3, Section 23 Parkes (part), Canberra was commissioned by the Geocon Group.  The 
company signed a 99-year Crown Lease for the property on 20 November 2017.  It plans to adapt the 
redundant three and four-level office building at the site as a hotel. 
West Block is included in the Commonwealth Heritage List (CHL place ID 105428), which is established 
under the Environment Protection Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act).  This HMP has been 
prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A of the Commonwealth Environment Protection Biodiversity 
Conservation Regulations, 2000: ‘Management Plans for Commonwealth Heritage Places’.  The 
overarching objective of Schedule 7A of the EPBC Act is to provide frameworks to inform the future 
conservation and management of the cultural heritage values of places included in the Commonwealth 
and National heritage lists.  This document also follows the principles and processes set out in heritage 
best practice guidelines, including the Burra Charter (2013).   
Overview of the asset 
West Block was designed in 1925, built in 1926-27 and was in use from August 1927.  It formed part of 
the Parliament House Secretariat group, which also includes East Block and the Provisional Parliament 
House.   
West Block comprises a series of four three-storey wings (or blocks) of varying footprint connected on a 
north-south axis.  It was designed in the interwar Stripped Classical style (also referred to as Modern 
Renaissance).  Distinguishing characteristics of the architectural language include horizontal massing, 
symmetrical façades divided into vertical bays, classical proportions and a general absence of applied 
detail.  It was a pragmatic and well-resolved solution to the challenge of accommodating a variety of 
official uses and operations within a tight timeframe.  The building has been subject to incremental 
change since 1937-38, when the first major works were carried out, including infilling of the original 
corner verandahs and balconies.  The last phase of external alterations was completed in 1948.  
There is a triangular at-grade car park to the west of the building, which is contemporary with the site’s 
establishment and is within Block 3, Section 23 Parkes (part).  A larger car park to the east of West Block, 
which dates from the late-1950s and is located on higher ground, is not within the site boundary.  There 
is a service road to the west of the West Block, separating the building from the triangular integral car 
park.   
An embankment to the east of the office building dates to 1925-26, when the site was partially levelled.  
The Dugout, a 1942 air raid shelter, is built into the embankment.  At the beginning of 1943, the shelter 
was adapted to accommodate a Typex cypher machine, used for coding and decoding cables.  The Typex 
machine enabled Prime Minister John Curtin to communicate directly with British Prime Minister 
Winston Churchill and American President Franklin Roosevelt during World War II.  The building has 
been in use as a substation since 1945.   
The landscape treatment to the north and west of West Block, including around the triangular car park, 
was established in the 1920s, as part of the broader landscaping for the south end of the Parliamentary 
Triangle.  Remnants of the formal 1920s landscape treatment, including mature deciduous trees and 
some hedges, are extant both within the subject site and addressing both sides of Queen Victoria 
Terrace.  The native plantings to the south and south-east of West Block are generally more recent.   
The site includes no significant objects or items of moveable heritage.

Findings 
The assessment of significance undertaken for this HMP has found that West Block satisfies the CHL 
threshold for: Criterion A (historical significance), Criterion D (principal characteristics), Criterion E 
(aesthetic significance), Criterion F (creative/technical significance) and Criterion H (significant 
associations).   
West Block is of historical significance to Australia for its association with Federation.  The building is a 
component of the Parliament House Secretariat group, the first premises purpose-built for Australia’s 
democratic government.  The principal component of the group is the Provisional Parliament House 
itself, as reflected in its siting on the Land Axis, and its visual prominence within the national capital.  
West and East blocks were supporting elements.  The primary role of these multi-purpose buildings was 
office accommodation.  The buildings within the Parliament House Secretariat group were conceived as 
temporary, pending the construction of a permanent Parliament House, completed in 1988.   
The Dugout is of historical significance as the building from which Prime Minister Curtin communicated 
with Australia’s allies during World War II, using a Typex cypher machine.  The building is also significant 
as a remnant of the World War II defences introduced within the Parliamentary Zone during World War 
II.   
West Block is significant for demonstrating the principal characteristics of the Federal Capital style, an 
interpretation of interwar Stripped Classicism which is now strongly associated with Canberra’s 
establishment phase.  Internal evidence of the building’s original/early character and layout is generally 
limited.   
The buildings that make up the Parliament House Secretariat group are symmetrically positioned within 
a large-scale landscape (the Parliamentary Triangle, south of King Edward Terrace) that was conceived in 
the 1920s as the centrepiece of the Federal Capital.  The landscape of the Parliamentary Triangle, 
although much altered, is of aesthetic significance.  The formality of the planned landscape provides an 
appropriately distinguished setting for the Provisional Parliament House.  It also contributed to the 
establishment of Canberra’s ‘Garden City’ identity.   
The Parliament House Secretariat group is located at the southern end of the Land Axis (Parliament 
House Vista), a key symbolic and planning component of Walter Burley Griffin’s concept for the National 
Capital.  The three buildings were designed by the office of J S Murdoch, Chief Architect of the 
Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways, and were sited to reinforce the formal qualities of 
the Land Axis.  The landscape treatment was designed and planted by Thomas Weston, with input from 
Murdoch.  Collectively, the planning and presentation of the Parliament House Secretariat group as a 
key component of Land Axis is a work of creative (technical) significance.    
West Block is significant for its associations with Walter Burley Griffin, J S Murdoch and Charles Weston, 
each of whom, variously, contributed to the planning, design and setting for the building.   
Recommendations 
The core recommendations of this HMP are summarised below:  
Conservation 
Conservation objectives for West Block include: 
 
Maintaining the external presentation of West Block as a free-standing structure with a general 
consistency of character and details expressive of the Federal Capital style. 
 
Conserving original/early (pre-1950) internal features and fabric specifically: the north-south 
axis that connects the four blocks on each level; the two staircases in B Block; timber ceiling

xvii 
panels where extant in A, B and C blocks, including a section that is known to survive on the 
ground floor of B Block; and timber structural framing on levels 1 and 2, which provide an 
insight into the ‘temporary’ (provisional) nature of the building. 
 
Conserving the Dugout, to the extent of fabric dating to the 1940s, and exploring opportunities 
to enhance an understanding of the building’s historical significance. 
 
Maintaining key structural landscape elements, including the original integral car park and the 
service road to the west of West Block, including a mixed plantation of exotic specimens to the 
north and west of West Block and native plantings to the east and south-east. 
 
Maintaining landscape characteristics as established in the 1920s. 
 
Maintaining trees dating to the 1920s. 
Management  
 
Geocon should comply with all applicable legislation in the management of West Block’s 
Commonwealth heritage values, including the EPBC Act.  
 
Programs of priority maintenance, remedial works and cyclical maintenance should form the 
basis for on-going care of the significant built fabric at West Block. 
 
The heritage curtilage for West Block should be understood as extending beyond the 
boundaries of Block 3, Section 23 Parkes (part) to include elements that connect West Block to 
the broader planned landscape,  
 
Future uses of West Block, including adaptation as a hotel, should be compatible with the 
assessed values of the place so that its cultural significance is maintained and conserved.  These 
values are both tangible (built fabric and landscape setting) and intangible (historical 
significance).  The values that relate to tangible elements can be maintained through 
conservation works and on-going management.  The historical values can be maintained 
through conservation of the original/early (pre-1950) building fabric and landscape elements, 
supplemented by on-site interpretation.   
 
Alterations to the Dugout to reveal its original form should be encouraged, supported by in-situ 
interpretation (see also final bullet point below).   
 
The extent of change at West Block since 1927 is such that reconstruction to an earlier or 
original form would be neither viable nor appropriate – the building’s evolved form should be 
understood as part of its historical significance.  There is, however, potential for that process of 
evolution to continue, subject to the recommendations of this HMP.   
 
The introduction of new buildings at the subject site should be sensitive to the heritage values 
of the place, including the presentation of West Block and its siting in relation to the Land Axis.  
 
Small-scale additions to support a viable and sustainable new use for West Block, such as 
pergolas or a porte-cochère, should be of generally light weight construction and set clear from 
the historic building fabric.   
 
The cultural heritage values of West Block and the Dugout should be actively promoted 
through a comprehensive package of heritage interpretation.  
The character and presentation of Commonwealth Avenue has been subject to almost wholesale 
change, with the removal of trees to the median strip and to both sides.  In response, the NCA has 
initiated a proposal to re-establish aspects of its original and early character. 6

INTRODUCTION 
This Heritage Management Plan (HMP) has been prepared for the Geocon Group, lease holder of West 
Block and the Dugout at Block 3, Section 23 Parkes (part).  NG Landholdings Hotel Pty Ltd signed a 99-
year Crown Lease for West Block on 20 November 2017 and plans to adapt the existing three and four-
level office building at the site as a hotel.  The site is owned by the West Block Trust (WBT), a 
discretionary trust the beneficiaries of which are Nick Georgalis, founder and managing director of 
Geocon, and associated entities/persons.  The trustee of WBT is West Block Pty Ltd.  Nick Georgalis is 
the sole director, member and office holder of West Block Pty Ltd.  
West Block and the Dugout (generally referred to here as West Block) is included in the Commonwealth 
Heritage List (CHL) as Place ID: 105428 (see Appendix A for citation).  As noted in the CHL citation for the 
property, West Block satisfies the following criteria Commonwealth Heritage criteria: ‘A, Processes’, ‘B, 
Rarity’, ‘D, Characteristic values’, ‘E, Aesthetic characteristics’, ‘F, Technical achievement’ and ‘H, 
Significant people’.   
1.1 
Background and brief 
This HMP has been prepared to satisfy Clause 2 ‘e’ part (ii) (a) which requires that the lessee must: 
… not later than the day which is 12 months after the date of commencement of 
the Lease, carry out and provide to the Department of the Environment and Energy 
a final version of the Heritage Management Plan for its review and approval … 
It is consistent with the requirements of Schedules 7A and 7B of the Commonwealth Environment 
Protection Biodiversity Conservation Regulations, 2000, respectively ‘Management Plans for 
Commonwealth Heritage Places’ and ‘Commonwealth Heritage management principles’ (see also 
Section 1.4).   
This document supersedes an HMP dated 2014 (but substantially drafted in 2010) for West Block 
prepared by Eric Martin and Associates Architects.   
The primary objectives of this HMP are to: 
 
Confirm the cultural heritage significance of West Block and the Dugout;  
 
Provide policies for the conservation of the place, taking into account the care of significant 
fabric, the appropriate management of hazardous materials and the use and management of 
the site; and 
 
Provide a heritage framework to inform future management of the place, including guidance on 
new works and development.  
1.2 
Identification of the place  
West Block is located to the south-west of the Provisional Parliament House at the southern apex of the 
Parliamentary Triangle (Figure 1).  The office building was constructed in 1926-27 and in use from 
August 1927 as part of the Parliament House Secretariat group.  East Block and the provisional 
Parliament House itself are the other components of the group.  The three buildings were designed by 
John Smith Murdoch, Chief Architect of the Commonwealth.  West Block, which was originally known as 
Secretariat No. 2, has been subject to incremental change and evolution over the past 90 years.  Its 
current extent is shown at Figure 2.   
The Dugout is a small, single-storey electrical substation to the east of the West Block (Figure 3).  It was 
built in 1942 as an air raid shelter.  The building’s significance derives from its adaptation in 1943 to 
accommodate a Typex cypher machine which enabled secure coded communication between Prime

Minister John Curtin and the leaders of Australia’s key allies, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill 
and American President Franklin Roosevelt.  
An approximately triangular at-grade carpark is located to the west of Block 3, Section 23 Parkes, and 
there are remnants of the original 1920s landscaping treatment to all sides of West Block, as well as 
more recent native plantings to the east and south-east.  The subject site covers an area of 1.689ha and 
includes three easements (see Figure 3).   
1.2.1 
Note regarding orientation 
The axis connecting the four blocks that comprise West Block is oriented on a diagonal to true north – 
technically north-northeast to south-southwest.  For ease of understanding, the elevation facing Queen 
Victoria Terrace is referred to in this report as north; the elevation oriented to Commonwealth Avenue 
as west; the elevation facing the embankment and the large car park south-east of the Provisional 
Parliament House is east; and the elevation oriented towards the New Parliament House is south.

Parliamentary Zone 
The term Parliamentary Zone in this document, consistent with the Parliament Act 1974 and as 
amended by the Parliamentary Precincts Act 1988 (Schedule 2, Section 3), captures: 
… the area of land bounded by a line commencing at a point where the eastern 
boundary of Commonwealth Avenue intersects the inner boundary of State Circle 
and proceeding thence in a northerly direction along the eastern boundary of 
Commonwealth Avenue until it intersects the southern shore of Lake Burley Griffin, 
thence in a generally easterly direction along that shore until it intersects the 
western boundary of Kings Avenue, thence in a south westerly direction along that 
boundary until it intersects the inner boundary of State Circle, and thence 
clockwise around that inner boundary to the point of commencement.7 
This area is illustrated at Figure 4.

Methodology and document structure  
This HMP broadly follows the principles and processes set out in the Burra Charter: The Australia 
ICOMOS Charter for Places of Cultural Significance, 2013 (The Burra Charter) and its Practice Notes.  The 
Burra Charter establishes a standard of practice for those involved in assessing, managing and 
undertaking works to places of cultural significance. 
Specifically, the report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 7A of the Commonwealth 
Environment Protection Biodiversity Conservation Regulations, 2000: ‘Management Plans for 
Commonwealth Heritage Places’.  As a Commonwealth Heritage place, an HMP for West Block must 
address a range of issues identified in the Regulations to the EPBC Act, at Schedules 7A and 7B.  The 
purpose of these issues is to ensure that the place meets the Commonwealth Heritage Management 
Principles set out in the Regulations.    
Table 1 below sets out the EPBC Act Regulations requirements for management plans and provides a 
comment about how the requirements are satisfied in the present HMP.

Statutory heritage controls 
1.5.1 
Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 
West Block and the Dugout is included in the Australian Heritage Council’s CHL as a Listed Place (Place 
ID: 105428).  It has been assessed as satisfying the following criteria: ‘A, Processes’, ‘B, Rarity’, ‘D, 
Characteristic values’, ‘E, Aesthetic characteristics’, ‘F, Technical achievement’ and ‘H, Significant 
people’.  The citation is included at Appendix A.

Non-statutory heritage listings and classifications  
1.6.1 
National Trust of Australia (ACT) 
West Block is included in the National Trust of Australia’s (ACT) Register of Classified Places.  The citation 
is included at Appendix A.   
1.6.2 
Register of the National Estate 
West Block and the Dugout were included in the Register of the National Estate in August 1987 (RNE 
100476).  Following amendments to the Australian Heritage Council Act 2003, the RNE was frozen on 19 
February 2007, which means that no new places can be added, or removed.  Since 2012 the RNE has 
been maintained on a non-statutory basis as a publicly available archive.  The citation is included at 
Appendix A.  
1.6.3 
Register of Significant Twentieth Century Architecture 
‘West Block Government Offices’ is included in the Register of Significant Twentieth Century 
Architecture (RSTCA), maintained by the Australian Institute of Architects (RSTCA, place no. R067).  It 
was included in the RSTCA in December 1983 as a place of national significance.  The citation is included 
at Appendix A.  
1.7 
Consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people  
The outcomes of consultation with Representative Aboriginal Organisations (RAO) undertaken in 
December 2013 have been relied upon for this HMP.  The consultation process followed at that time 
included a meeting on site attended by: Dr Peter Dowling, a consultant engaged in the preparation of an 
HMP for West Block on behalf of the Department of Finance; Wally Bell of Buru Ngunawal Aboriginal 
Corporation; and James Mundy of Ngarigu Currawong Clan.  A site walk was preceded by discussion of 
traditional land use and the site’s history generally.  
As recorded in the HMP (2014) for West Block: 
The consensus of opinion was that there were no concerns regarding Aboriginal 
cultural heritage for the area.  But a need was agreed that the use of the area as a 
pathway from Black Mountain to the site occupied by New Parliament House 
should be acknowledged.8 
Had the outcomes of the 2013 consultation process yielded outcomes that were contested or otherwise 
contentious, Lovell Chen would have initiated report-specific consultation with RAOs.   
1.8 
Social values  
No formal appraisal of social values, as might be informed by a community consultation process, was 
undertaken in the course of this HMP.  It is, however, contended that neither West Block nor the Dugout 
satisfy the CHL threshold for social value.  See further discussion at Chapter 3, Section 3.3.

Limitations 
The Dugout is in use as an electrical substation by ActewAGL.  During research for this HMP it was not 
possible to gain access to the building.   
As a consequence, it has not been possible to establish the extent to which the building interior has the 
ability to demonstrate its World War II-era use for coding/decoding messages from key allies.   
Commentary regarding the building’s condition in this report is based on external visual inspection.

UNDERSTANDING THE PLACE  
The following presents a chronological history of key events in the conception, construction, use and 
development of West Block, with a particular emphasis on the built fabric and landscape setting.  
Consistent with the Burra Charter, the aim is to gather information about the place sufficient to 
understand significance.9   
Architectural drawings relating to the various phases of development are at Appendix B.  
2.1 
Pre-European settlement 
Canberra is located on underlying sedimentary and volcanic rock formed over the past 450 million years.  
Considerable evidence exists in the region of Indigenous occupation, primarily dating to the mid-late 
Holocence.  The Australian Capital Territory is located within the traditional boundary of the Kamberri, a 
Walgalu-speaking group who occupied the Murrumbidgee west and south west of Lake George at the 
time of European arrival in the region in the 1820s.10 
At the time of European settlement, the site of the national capital was native grassland with eucalypt 
forest on the surrounding hills.  With the introduction of pastoral activities in the early nineteenth 
century, the natural vegetation was largely destroyed by overstocking and clearing of the forests which 
caused extensive soil erosion.  By the time the site was selected for the new capital (discussed below) 
the land had become degraded and some of the surrounding hills had been largely denuded of tree 
cover. 
2.2 
The Griffin plan for Canberra  
Even before Australia became a federated nation, the need for a national capital for the colonies was 
apparent.  A direction to hold land for a capital was included within the Australian Constitution (1901), 
and in 1908 the area of Yass-Canberra was named as the site of the federal capital.  After an extensive 
survey, the current location of Canberra was selected. 
In April 1911 the Minister for Home Affairs, on behalf of the Commonwealth Government, initiated an 
international competition for designs for the layout of the federal capital.  The 137 entries were judged 
by a three-man panel comprising James Alexander Smith (engineer), John Kirkpatrick (architect) and 
John Montgomery Coane (licensed surveyor).  On 14 May 1912, two of the panel members, (Smith and 
Kirkpatrick) selected Walter Burley Griffin's entry as the winner, and on 23 May 1912 the Minister for 
Home Affairs concurred with the majority decision and Griffin was awarded first prize.  Entries by Eliel 
Saarinen (Helsinki) and Alfred Agache (Paris) placed second and third respectively.   
It was not the Government’s intention to fully implement the winning design.  Rather, the terms of the 
competition were that, ‘the premiated designs shall become the property of the Government for its 
unrestricted use, either in whole or in part.’11  Accordingly, the three winning entries, as well as the 
scheme placed first by Coane (prepared by Sydney practice Griffiths, Coulter and Caswell) were 
purchased by the Government.   
The Griffin scheme – planned by Walter and rendered by his wife Marion Mahony Griffin – was 
distinguished by an intimate relationship with the landscape.  The central component of the proposal 
was an equilateral triangle (the National Triangle) whose corners were aligned on topographic outcrops 
or elevated land, specifically Mount Vernon in the north-west, Mount Kurrajong in the south, and the 
saddle between Russell Hill and Mount Pleasant in the north-east.  The sides of the triangle formed the 
major avenues connecting the three primary centres of activity in the new city: the national government 
at the apex, and the municipal and market centres at the east and west of the base respectively.  
A series of axes provided a further organisational underpinning for the plan, specifically the Land Axis, 
Water Axis and the Municipal Axis.  The Land Axis formed the central alignment of the plan.  The line

L O V EL L  C H EN 
extended from Mount Ainslie to distant Mount Bimberi via Mount Kurrajong, bisecting the central 
triangle and tying the city to its site.  The formality and definition of this broad central axis was 
reinforced by the symmetrical siting of buildings at major intersections.   
Griffin’s plan for Canberra envisaged the government complex as a symmetrical group of buildings 
overlooked by Parliament House on Camp Hill at the south (Figure 5).  Historian Paul Reid has described 
the composition: 
Griffin’s concept for government is simple: Parliament at the head, courts of justice 
at the foot and departments on the flanks.  The geometric response to topography 
[however] causes a response.  The keyhole-shaped government site has two parts: 
one dominant (the Kurrajong circle), and the other subordinate (the triangle 
including Camp Hill).  With the axial layout of the Griffin plan, Kurrajong became 
absolutely dominating.  It is the climax of the whole city design, the obvious site for 
Parliament …12 
Griffin located Parliament House on the Land Axis, with the Senate and the House of Representatives 
clearly expressed to east and west of the building mass.  Ornamental ponds extended along the balance 
of the Land Axis to the lake, giving Parliament House a degree of prominence in the city (Figure 6).  
Capitol Hill (Mount Kurrajong) was terminus of the ensemble, with accommodation for the Governor-
General and the Prime Minister either side of a central administration building.13

2.3 
Early planning for Canberra (1912-1925) 
Between 1912 and 1925, when the layout of the city of Canberra and its environs was gazetted, the plan 
for the federal capital was the subject of numerous modifications and revisions.  The first of these, in 
November 1912, was a plan prepared by the Departmental Board, a body charged with implementing 
the city structure (Figure 7).  The Board’s plan, which was approved in 1913, retained Griffin’s Land Axis 
and the axial siting of Parliament house, but generally incorporated very little of Griffin’s scheme, which 
was deemed extravagant, costly and impractical.   
The first peg of the city was driven on 20 February 1913, six months before the Griffins arrived in 
Australia (18 August 1913), at the invitation of William Kelly who followed King O’Malley as minister 
responsible for the national capital following a change of government.

2.3.1 
Walter Burley Griffin, Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction (1913-20) 
On 26 August 1913, the Departmental Board met with Walter Burley Griffin in Melbourne and expressed 
a number of fundamental concerns about the proposal, including its scale and siting.14  Griffin revised 
his scheme later that year, seeking to address a number of the matters raised by the Board, but the 
distance between the architect’s vision and that proposed by the government officials remained 
significant.  The working relationship between the two was also increasingly dysfunctional.  Forced to 
choose between the two, Minister Kelly disbanded the Board in October 1913 and appointed Griffin as 
Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction on a three-year contract (the contract eventually 
expired at the end of 1920).  Also in 1913, Kelly revoked the approval of the Board plan and formally 
sanctioned support for Griffin’s revised plan.  As noted by heritage consultant Duncan Marshall: 
This plan now became the basic planning document, informing all of the Griffins’ 
later revisions, including the final version of the design prepared in 1918.  The final 
version served, in turn, as the model for the official gazetted plan of 1925 which 
was to have a long-lasting effect.15 
In the revised scheme Griffin’s original vision for the central National Triangle was re-established, as was 
the symmetrical composition of the Government Group to either side of the Land Axis.

Griffin’s tenure as Federal Capital Director of Design was mired by tensions between government 
officials and departments and hampered by changes in government.  In addition, the Great War of 1914-
18 was a significant distraction and drain on resources.   
The tensions between Griffin and government officials were addressed in a Royal Commission on 
Federal Capital Administration (1916-17), which found that Griffin had been obstructed.16  Following the 
Royal Commission, responsibility for the national capital shifted from the Department of Home Affairs to 
a new branch within the Department of Home and Territories under Griffin’s control, allowing him a 
freer rein in his remaining years as the Federal Capital Director of Design.17 
The pace of development in Canberra between 1913 and the mid-1920s was slow.  In the period to 
1924, a total of £3.4 million was invested in the construction of the city,18 and in 1916 and 1917 annual 
expenditure on capital works was only £8,000.19  By 1920 development in the city included the Power 
House complex at Kingston (1916), the brickworks at Yarralumla (1913), Cotter Dam (1912), sewerage 
works and transmission lines.  As noted by Reid, by the time Griffin left Canberra at the end 1920, ‘[his] 
design was apparent only in some road forming and finishing east of [Mount] Vernon and west of 
Kurrajong’.20  
2.3.2 
The Federal Capital Advisory Committee (1921-24) 
The Federal Capital Advisory Committee (FCAC) was established in January 1921 to advise the 
Government on the development of Canberra.  The Committee recommended a three-phase approach:  
 
The transfer of Parliament and essential departments to Canberra;  
 
The development of rail connections, engineering works and the establishment of the central 
administration of other government departments; and 
 
The damming of the Molonglo River and construction of major architectural projects.21   
The FCAC’s role was primarily advisory.  Works were undertaken by the executive officers of the 
Departments of Home & Territories and Works & Railways, and subsequently by the Federal Capital 
Commission (FCC, Section 2.3.3).   
Planning for the transfer of Parliament commenced in 1921.  From the outset, there was broad 
acceptance that the new Parliament House would be temporary.  Construction of a permanent structure 
would be both costly (a pertinent consideration in the context of managing post-war debt) and time-
consuming, potentially delaying the transfer of Parliament for many years.  Options canvassed in 1921 
and 1922 included construction of a Conference Hall that could be augmented for use as a Parliament 
House when required, and a building of demonstrably temporary character – perhaps built of 
corrugated sheet metal, fibro-cement of weatherboard – that might serve for 10-20 years before 
replacement.22  Discussion also focused on whether the city would evolve around the temporary 
building, or whether the location of the permanent structure would be the key determinant for the 
city’s evolution.  This question required consideration of how temporary the provisional Parliament 
House would be.  That is to say, would it be removed or repurposed when the permanent structure was 
completed?   
In February-March 1923, a Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works considered the issue and 
interviewed approximately 50 witnesses.  The outcome was a report in July 1923 with two options: a 
nucleus of permanent buildings for Parliamentary use located on Camp Hill, to be expanded as required; 
and a provisional structure on the north-facing slope of Camp Hill.  In August 1923 the Government, 
anxious to expedite the relocation of Parliament, selected the provisional option, for which a design was 
already underway (see 2.4).23  The first sod was turned on 28 August 1923.24

Federal Capital Commission (1925-30) 
The Government established the Federal Capital Commission (FCC) under the Seat of Government 
(Administration) Act of 1924.  The FFC’s immediate task was to oversee the relocation of Parliament 
from Melbourne to Canberra.  The FCC was also responsible for the gazettal of the Griffin plan of 1918.   
Griffin’s plan was, in the main, ignored by the FCC, as was his recommended pattern of settlement.  The 
FCC chose to focus on the delivery of isolated buildings; Griffin’s intent had been to concentrate 
development around the Municipal Axis (Constitution Avenue).  The FCC promoted the development of 
an ‘Initial City’ to the south of the Molonglo River flood plain, close to the Civic Centre indicated on the 
Departmental Board plan of 1913; Griffin had recommended that the core of the city be located around 
Mount Vernon, the Civic Centre indicated on his original competition entry.   
The FCC was a dynamic, fast-acting agency which oversaw the first concerted wave of development at 
Canberra.  By the time it was wound up in 1930 development delivered by the FCC south of the 
Molonglo River valley included, but was not limited to:  
 
The ‘Initial City’, including the present suburbs of Kingston, Griffith, Barton and Forrest 
 
The Provisional Parliament House and two Secretariat buildings (East and West blocks), 
collectively the Parliament House Secretariat group (see Section 2.4) 
 
Albert Hall 


The Parliament House Secretariat group (1922-28) 
The 1923 decision to relocate Parliament from Melbourne to Canberra was the catalyst for an enormous 
logistical exercise of bureaucracy and construction.  Within the space of only four years Canberra was 
transformed from two nascent communities (or villages) either side of the Molonglo River valley into the 
seat of national government with facilities and amenities to support the population influx.    
The provision of office space to accommodate Government departments was considered from early 
1923.  An early option, put forward by the FCAC, was for the construction of 18 temporary buildings 
connected by walk-ways and with a central refectory on a site to the north-west of the provisional 
Parliament House.25  The proposal was not supported by the Public Works Committee (PWC) which in 
July 1923 recommended to Parliament the construction of two two-storey buildings to the south of the 
provisional Parliament House.  The PWC’s advice was for:  
… two units of two-storied brick or concrete buildings on the east and west of the 
two blocks to the north of the proposed Parliament House … If this is to be done 
[the Committee considered that] two units of permanent buildings [would] be 
available approximately 1,000 feet [c. 350 metres] apart, and a similar distance 
from the permanent Parliament House site on Camp Hill, and in positions allocated 
for office purposes on the accepted plan.26   
The FCAC did not support the PWC’s recommendation, and instead drafted competition terms for one 
permanent administration building, on a site to the north-east of the provisional Parliament House.  A 
design competition for this building was held in 1924 and was won by Sydney architect George Sydney 
Jones.27  His design was modified extensively after his sudden death in 1927.28  The Administrative 
Building, now known as the John Gorton Building, was not completed until after World War II and was 
the largest office building in Australia at the time.29

As the new permanent Administration Building could not be completed before the first session of 
Parliament a ‘Secretariat Scheme’ was put forward as an alternative.  This would see a nucleus of each 
Department temporarily relocated to Canberra to assist with Parliamentary work.30  Although it was 
recognised that this arrangement may cause some additional administrative burden for the 
departments, it was considered the best way to balance the requirement for space and the conflicting 
views about permanence of new buildings.31  
This scheme was approved by the Minister and the recommendations made by the PWC in 1923 were 
ultimately implemented – although the buildings as completed were primarily of three levels, not two.   
2.4.1 
Design and construction 
As noted, the Parliament House Secretariat group is comprised of: the provisional Parliament House, 
East Block and West Block.  Each was designed by the Public Works Department under the leadership of 
Commonwealth Architect John Smith Murdoch and built between 1922 and 1928 (see Section 2.4.2).  
They were the first buildings completed in the Parliamentary Triangle.  
The decision to construct a provisional Parliament House on the Land Axis below (to the north of) Camp 
Hill, leaving Camp Hill itself for a permanent Parliament building, had a bearing on the height and 
massing of the temporary structure; views along the Land Axis were to be unimpeded by the temporary 
building.  It also influenced the character and massing of East and West blocks.

In 1924, Murdoch described the Secretariat buildings to the Parliamentary Standing Committee for 
Public Works: 
The two buildings will remain a symmetrical balance with the Provisional 
Parliament House.  While being architecturally sympathetic with the Provisional 
Parliament House their size will be subordinated to the larger structure.  The style 
is Modern Renaissance, to which the British and Americans are now working.  It is a 
style which depends on proportions and lines rather than details.32 
Additional information about the design approach was provided by Colonel P T Owen, Director General 
of Works and Railways in evidence to the Standing Committee: 
The general idea is to avoid the domestic in favour of the Official style so far as may 
be compatible with reasonable expenditure …. A tiled roof for an official building 
would be regarded as ‘fussy’ although it would be quite correct for hotels and 
residences … I believe the flat roofs of the Secretariat buildings can be made very 
beautiful in this way.33 
Of the two, the building now known as East Block, was completed first, in 1927.  ‘Secretariat No. 1’ 
provided 2,579 square metres (27,760 square feet) of floor space and accommodated a telephone 
exchange, post office and space for 150 staff.  It was anticipated that the building might eventually be 
used as offices for Members of Parliament.34  Today it houses the National Archives of Australia.  
In January 1925 the FCC Architects Branch reported that the construction of West Block had 
commenced: 
Steady progress has been made by the contractors, Messrs Hutcherson Bros, in the 
erection of West Block (Secretariat No. 2), and the completion of the central blocks 
and south block should be affected by the end of July.  In order to give proper 
divisions for the various Departments who will be occupying this building, a large 
amount of coke breeze partitions [a light concrete building block made with cinder 
aggregate] have been erected and Ministerial Office(s) have been panelled.  The 
various mechanical services covering lifts, heating, electrical installation, and fire 
alarm system, are well advanced, and in some cases are now completed.35 
It is assumed that construction would have been preceded by excavation works to level the sloping site, 
creating the embankment that remains to the east of West Block.  
Although there was a preference for the two Secretariat buildings to be completed in time for the 
official opening of Parliament in May 1927, only East Block was ready in time.36  The fit-out of West 
Block was at least partially completed in August 1927, as reported in the ‘Canberra News’ section The 
Week periodical.37 
Distinguishing characteristics of the architectural language adopted by Murdoch for the two buildings 
included the following (see Figure 9 and 1926 drawings at Appendix A): 
 
Horizontal massing 
 
Symmetrical façade divided into vertical bays 
 
Classical proportions 
 
Plinths and ground level treatments of face brickwork, with the upper levels rendered and 
painted white  
 
Corner balconies and verandahs  
 
A general absence of applied details, an exception being the Greek-pattern metal railings to the 
balconies and verandahs  
 
Screened courtyards 
 
Flat roof areas concealed by parapets

The design response was a pragmatic and well-resolved solution to the challenge of accommodating a 
variety of uses quickly.  The buildings are architecturally unpretentious, adopting a neutral, or official 
character; by the mid-twentieth century, the two buildings were recognised as early and influential 
examples of the Federal Capital style. See Section 3.2.1 for discussion of the Federal Capital style in 
Chapter 3). 
While the two buildings were not mirror images in plan – possibly relating to their original uses, which 
were quite distinct (see discussion of West Block’s original occupants at Section 2.5) – both East Block 
and West Block are arranged on a north-south axis with main entrances on the east-west axis, 
perpendicular to the Land Axis, from which they are equidistant (Figure 10).  The arrangement of blocks 
of varying sizes on an axial alignment provided for a degree of flexibility, enabling change and 
alterations without abstracting the formal presentation and architectural character of the building 
complexes.

2.4.2 
John Smith Murdoch (1862-1945) 
The majority of buildings for Canberra’s establishment phase (1920s) were designed by Public Works 
Department (PWD) staff based in Melbourne and Melbourne-based architectural practices.  Among 
them, the principal voice was John Smith Murdoch, a Scottish architect who migrated to Victoria in 
1885.  Murdoch joined the Commonwealth Department of Home Affairs in 1904, as a senior clerk in the 
Public Works Branch.  Ten years later he was promoted to the title of Commonwealth Architect, and in 
1919 he became Chief Architect of the Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways.38   
Murdoch and his department were prolific during the early decades of the twentieth century, designing 
Commonwealth facilities across the country in a variety of styles.  Murdoch’s design for the 
Commonwealth Offices in Treasury Place, Melbourne – the first purpose-built premises of the 
Commonwealth Treasury and Cabinet departments – was inspired by the Edwardian Baroque.  
Murdoch, as the senior Commonwealth architect, was also closely involved in planning for the federal 
capital.   
His work in Canberra adopted a quite distinct idiom, a synthesis of revivalist and overseas styles 
including neo-Georgian, Colonial Revival, Spanish Mission and the Prairie Style.  This synthesis has come 
to be known as the Federal Capital style.   
Works attributed to Murdoch in Canberra, aside from the provisional Parliament House and the two 
Secretariat buildings, include: the Canberra and Kurrajong hotels (1924 and 1926 respectively), to 
accommodate public servants required to relocate to the Canberra; the Kingston Power House (1916); 
and the first buildings at the Mount Stromlo Observatory.  The residential suburbs of Reid, Ainslie, 
Forrest and Barton also evolved from the same cycle of construction.39   
2.4.3 
Landscaped setting  
The original landscaping treatments to the west, north and north-east of West Block were among the 
earliest in Canberra.  The works were arranged and planted by Charles Weston, officer-in-charge of 
afforestation at the national capital, with support and advice from others (see Section 2.4.4).   
A key reference for the following section is a 1928 plan of ‘permanent plantings’ within the 
‘Government Group’ at Appendix A (see also detail at Figure 11).  Photographs c. 1928 confirm that 
West Block’s setting was initially planted to a layout which accords with what is shown in the 1928 plan. 
A discussion of existing landscape conditions at, within and around West Block is at Section 2.10.4.  
Commonwealth Avenue  
Plantings to either side of Commonwealth Avenue were established from the beginning of 1922.  The 
median strip was planted with two rows of Himalayan cedar (Cedrus deodara) with a single row of 
Atlantic cedar (Cedrus atlantica) in the centre.  Further rows of Himalayan cedar were planted to the 
east and west sides of the Avenue with rows of Chinese elms (Ulmus chinensis) behind.  The outcome 
was both a formal avenue and a wind break to protect the Parliamentary Administrative Area (Figure 
12).  Weston also introduced shrubs and ground covers, including roses in the area.40   The 1920s 
planting treatment and landscape character of Commonwealth Avenue has been all but lost over time.   
The Parliamentary Triangle, including West Block 
The FCAC considered the landscape treatment of the south end of the Parliamentary Triangle (also 
referred to as the Parliamentary Gardens), including West and East blocks, as the centrepiece of the 
Federal Capital.41  The approximately 35-hectare area bounded by Kings and Commonwealth avenues, 
State Circle and King Edward Terrace was almost entirely denuded, with the exception of some native

vegetation on Mount Kurrajong and Camp Hill (discussed below).  Beautification was required to provide 
a suitably distinguished setting for Parliamentary proceedings, and to manage the prevailing winds.  
As noted by John Gray in this doctoral thesis on Charles Weston, ‘[By 1924] the Federal Capital Advisory 
Committee decided the design of the gardens should reflect the formality of the Provisional Parliament 
House [then under construction], be on … strictly formal lines and include a body of ornamental 
water’.42  Plantings were used to framed vistas and create ‘outdoor rooms’ (Figure 13).  
The selection of plantings and their final arrangement was the work of Weston, with input from 
Murdoch, who had instructed the use of poplars to define the Land Axis, key entrances to the 
Parliamentary Triangle and intersections within it.43  Murdoch’s preference was for the balance of the 
trees to be lower than the poplars and widely-spaced, ‘… the idea being that the comparatively flat 
buildings will not be unduly dwarfed or views of them too much obscured by trees’.44 
The poplars were introduced between June and August 1925, with the balance of planting assumed to 
have been completed by November 1926, when Weston retired.  Planted in pairs or fours to address 
major axial pathways and intersections, each poplar was situated in a square or roughly squared 
enclosure, edged with low privet hedges.45   
The selection of poplars as a primary species effectively denied any potential for the gardens to develop 
a distinctly Australian character, as had been contemplated by the FCAC and others.  Native trees and 
shrubs were, however, selected for new plantings in the vicinity of Camp Hill and Mount Kurrajong (see 
discussion below), and were employed by Weston in tertiary roles within the Parliamentary Triangle’s 
tree plantings.  
While Weston’s selection of specimen conifers for many of the structural plantings within the 
Parliamentary Triangle landscape, including Deodar cedar (Cedrus deodara) and Atlantic cedar (Cedrus 
atlantica), was at odds with Murdoch’s preference for low-growing specimens, it was consistent with his 
own vision for the city.  As noted at Section 2.4.4, Weston had anticipated that cedars would form the 
chief arboreal feature of the city in 1917.46  Another variation to Murdoch’s preferred outcome was the 
density of plantings, with rows of closely-planted trees sometimes four deep.  John Gray suggests that, 
‘[Weston’s deliberate over-planting] had in mind a quick effect and possible species performance 
difficulties.  He may have assumed a thinning in about 20 years’.47 
The landscape treatments around East and West blocks were critical to the overall composition of the 
Parliamentary Gardens landscape.  As described by Eric Martin et al, ‘[They form] symmetrical anchors 
behind and either side of the 1927 Provisional Parliament House … the longitudinal axis of each block is 
extrapolated further with each northern pavilion [A Block at West Block] addressing an extended axial 
vista’ (Figure 14).48  Each block was situated to relate to the Provisional Parliament House and to its 
corresponding formal axis, while being largely invisible from each other as a consequence of the 
topography of the Camp Hill situated between them. 
At West Block, fast-growing Lombardy poplars (Populus nigra ‘Italica’, described in the 1928 Plan of 
Permanent Planting as Populus pyramidalis) were planted in accordance with Murdoch’s instruction, in 
small square planting beds, serving to mark and extend the axial vista, and to frame views of the 
building’s north elevation.  The pairing at the north end of West Block mirrored an identical planting 
already established across Queen Victoria Terrace to the north.  To the west, similar pairs of Lombardy 
Poplars, also planted earlier, addressed the intersection of the Terrace with Commonwealth Avenue.  
One of the original Lombardy poplars marking the northern axis survives within the West Block curtilage, 
although the pair of square landscape enclosures have been removed.  On the north side of Queen 
Victoria Terrace, the corresponding pair of trees has been replaced in their original locations with new 
Poplar specimens, and the square enclosures have been maintained with the low hedging as originally

conceived.  The pair of Lombardy poplars once located at the north end of the West Block car park, 
aligned with Commonwealth Avenue, have not survived. 
Along both sides of Queen Victoria Terrace, between these landmarks and extending to the east, mixed 
avenue plantings of White poplar (Populus alba), Pin oak (Quercus palustris) and Lawson’s cypress 
(Chamaecyparis lawsoniana) reinforced the precinct’s formality.  Some of these avenue trees appear to 
have survived to the present day; others have been replaced. 
Around West Block itself, a variety of poplars, elms and cypress trees were planted, and eucalypts 
(Eucalyptus globulus) were introduced in the courtyards to the east and west of B Block.  
The other key feature of the West Block precinct was the integral car park to the west.  This triangular 
space was surrounded by a pedestrian walkway.  Beginning at the centre of this triangular space, an 
inner ring of shade trees was planted within the periphery of the car park surface, consisting of 
alternating American elms (Ulmus americana) and Black ash (Fraxinus nigra, then described as Fraxinus 
sambucifolia).  Beyond this ring, the perimeter beds located between the car park and the pedestrian 
walkways were planted with two distinctive treatments.  The north and east sides of the car park were 
closely planted with Pin oaks, developing a visual screen to reduce the prominence of the car park in 
views from the landscape west of Parliament House and from West Block itself.  Meanwhile, the south-
west side of the car park triangle was completed with a broadly spaced row of alternating Atlantic cedar 
and Giant redwood (Sequiadendron giganteum, then described as Sequoia gigantea), continuing a more 
extensive double row of these trees which was planted on the next landscaped block along 
Commonwealth Avenue to the northwest.  This broadly-spaced treatment, in contrast to the density of 
plantings on the sides of the car park proximate to Queen Victoria Terrace, provided a degree of visual 
permeability to drivers on Commonwealth Avenue during their final approach to the Parliamentary 
Triangle.  
An additional row of American Elms was established on the western boulevard of the service road, 
directly opposite West Block, interplanted with mixed pairs of Mountain Ash (Sorbus aucuparia, then 
described as Pyrus acuparia) and Mexican Cypress (Cupressus lusitanica, then described as Cupressus 
knightiana). 
The aerial photographic record indicates that a reconfiguration of the car park layout occurred at some 
stage after 1985.  Despite this, portions of the original car park planting layout have been retained to 
the present day, either in the form of original trees planted in the late 1920s, or as sympathetic 
replacements established somewhat later in the place of deceased original stock.  These retentions 
include much of the Pin Oak screen on the Queen Victoria Terrace side of the car park (likely comprising 
a mix of original and replacement stock), as well as a small number of mature Elm trees on the western 
boulevard of the service road which appear to represent the original American Elm planting.  The inner 
ring planting of elms and ash within the original triangular car park has been retained in a fragmentary 
form after the recent reconfiguration, represented by a small number of Elm trees located on the 
perimeter of the paved area and in island beds within it.  Some of these trees are certainly later 
replacement plantings some may be original American Elms.

The 1920s planting treatment was generally extant in 1950, as shown in aerial view at Figure 16.  Today, 
a fraction of the original plantings survive.  As is the case elsewhere within the Parliamentary Gardens, 
the extant plantation is conspicuously thinner and also less diverse, having consolidated from the 
original experimental plantation to those trees which have proven most hardy to the local climate and 
planting conditions.  
As in other places in Australia, certain trees have proved to have generally shorter lifespans than in their 
indigenous conditions, including the Giant redwoods which the photographic record shows were initially 
successful in the West Block planting.  As a consequence of either their planting position or of the 
impact of climate stressors and periods of drought, these trees have been lost within the West Block 
planting, excepting a single specimen which may be a somewhat younger replacement planting for a 
failure in the original stock.49  In a similar fashion, the formal plantings of Lombardy poplar have 
performed to their typical lifespan as a fast-growing species in Australia, and deceased trees in the 
formal arrangement have in some places within the Parliamentary Triangle been appropriately replaced 
with new stock (as has been done on Queen Victoria Terrace opposite West Block).

Despite these challenges, a number of original specimens have been retained within the planted 
landscape integral to West Block.  In addition to the single Lombardy poplar, the four surrounding 
Arizona cypresses are original trees which maintain the formal setting of the building in relation to the 
formal axis.  Atlantic cedars retained adjacent to Commonwealth Drive similarly maintain a sense of the 
original treatment of this face of the site, along with the single Giant redwood survivor.  Although the 
car park has been altered relatively recently, retained or replanted specimens and groups of Pin Oak and 
Elm continue to serve as the amenity and screening planting for which they were originally conceived.  
Camp Hill and Mount Kurrajong  
In contrast to the Beaux Arts-inspired formality of the Parliamentary Administrative Area, the FCAC 
adopted the principle of retaining the existing open landscape of indigenous trees on Mount Kurrajong 
and Camp Hill, respectively located to the south-east and east of West Block (see Figure 13),50 and 
reinforcing this with further plantings of native trees, shrubs and groundcovers.  The front edge of Camp 
Hill, facing the provisional Parliament House, may have been mass planted with the ‘Mixed Acacias’ 
labelled on the 1928 plan; a massed planting in this location is certainly visible in c. 1928 views across 
the precinct (Figure 13) and was later extended to the embankment immediately east of West Block51 
before gradual attrition and loss to subsequent developments and changing land management 
practices. 
Despite the construction of the new Parliament House and the Federation Mall land bridge connecting 
the old and new Parliament Houses, and a modern car park to the immediate east of West Block, this 
landscape character and its rationale endures. 
2.4.4 
Charles Weston (1866-1935) 
During the early 1920s, the character of Canberra as a city in the landscape was given form by 
horticulturalist Thomas Charles George Weston (generally known as Charles).  Weston was officer-in-
charge of Afforestation (later Parks and Gardens) at the national capital from 1913 to 1926.  He was an 
island of continuity during a period of rapid change in the management and administration of the 
emerging city.   
Weston’s challenge, as noted in the Australian Dictionary of Biography, was: 
… to create an urban landscape [at the remote, infertile, windy and rabbit infested 
location] consonant with the capital city to be built at Canberra.  He was also 
expected to establish a local forestry industry.  Weston set down on paper his four 
objectives: to establish a first-class nursery, to raise stocks of plants likely to prove 
suitable, to reserve all local hilltops and improve their tree cover, and to seek out 
and procure useful seeds.52 
His work in Canberra fell into two phases.  The first, from 1913 to 1920, was focussed on the 
establishment of nurseries and plant propagation.  The second, from 1920 to 1926, was focussed on 
planting and landscape development.53   
In general, Weston favoured conifers as a key structure planting.  In 1917 he stated that three cedars, 
Deodar, Atlantic and Lebanon (Cedrus deodara, Cedrus atlantica and Cedrus libani) would be useful as 
the chief arboreal feature of the city.54  He also pioneered the use of several eucalypts such as Brittle 
Gum (Eucalyptus mannifera) and Argyle Apple (Eucalyptus cinerea).   
Weston’s approach to formal avenue plantings was to use one predominant species, often adding a 
smaller scale tree that would give seasonal colour, such as an avenue of Blue Gum (Eucalyptus bicostata) 
with Flowering Cherry Plum (Prunus cerasifera ‘Nigra’).  A variation on this approach was to use a

conifer, such as a cypress, cedar or pine, as the major planting.  In some instances a Kurrajong 
(Brachychiton populneus) was used as the smaller tree.55 
Weston planted parks and reserves in a less formal manner.  The style of planting employed in these 
reserves followed the Garden City style and was a notable departure from Griffin’s intentions for the 
city.56  In this regard. Weston is likely to have been influenced by John Sulman (1849-1934), an architect 
who was prominent in shaping ideas on town planning in Australia during the period leading to 
Canberra’s inception.  He served as chairman of the FCAC from 1921 to 1924.  As noted by the late 
landscape architect Peter Harrison, author of Walter Burley Griffin: Landscape Architect (1995) Sulman, 
‘required that Griffin's conception of the capital as a city of monumental buildings be modified, that it 
should be regarded in the early period of its existence more as a Garden Town, the erection of the 
permanent buildings being deferred … until economic conditions might be more favourable’.57

West Block, 1927-38 
The first departments transferred from Melbourne to West Block were the Prime Minister’s 
Department, the Department of Home and Territories, the Department of the Treasury, the Attorney 
General’s Department and the Official Secretary to the Governor-General (Figure 17).  The National 
Library was accommodated in A Block, at the north end of the building.58  The inclusion of office space 
for the Prime Minister’s Department was due to the distance of Yarralumla House from Canberra’s 
administrative centre.   
Although the first Cabinet meeting in Canberra was held at Yarralumla on 30 January 1924, the first 
Cabinet meetings after the Provisional Parliament House was opened in May 1927 were held in West 
Block.59  The use of West Block for Cabinet meetings outside sitting weeks – when the Cabinet Room in 
Parliament House was used for its convenient location adjacent to the Prime Minister’s office – 
persisted until 1932, when the Lyons’ Government transferred it permanently.60  The location of the 
space at West Block that hosted Cabinet meetings between 1928 and 1932 is not annotated on historic 
drawings and has not been identified during research for this HMP.  
The relocation of the National Library from Melbourne to Canberra coincided with the transfer of 
Parliament to the Provisional Parliament House.  The first incarnation of the national library was the 
Commonwealth Parliamentary Library in 1902, which was attached to the Victorian Parliamentary 
Library in Melbourne.61  The Victorian parliamentary librarian acted as a ‘librarian on loan’ to the 
Commonwealth government until the library was relocated to Canberra in 1927.62  
From 1927 to 1936 the National Library was housed in A Block at the north end of West Block, and 
occupied all levels (Figure 18).  At the time, it was primarily a parliamentary library, rather than a 
national cultural institution.63    
The ‘sparse and restricted services of the National Library’ were criticised in a 1934 report on libraries in 
Australia. 64  The following year, the Prime Minister’s Department provided supplementary funding to 
the library, and in 1936, the library relocated.  Purpose-built premises for the National Library were 
completed, enabling the co-location of all collections and staff within one building in the Parliamentary 
Triangle.

Alterations, 1927-38 
Major alterations to West Block were required to accommodate the new External Affairs Department 
and for the relocation of the Auditor-General’s department, which was to be moved to Canberra from 
Melbourne.65   
Works undertaken in 1927-38 included:  
 
Enclosure of the corner balconies and verandas to create additional office space66  
 
An additional level on top of the two-storey wings to A and C Blocks, bringing the whole building 
to the same level.  This change resulted in the removal of original windows 
 
The closure of the open links between the central block (B Block) and A and C blocks 
See plans, elevations and sections of changes at West Block in 1927-38 at Appendix B. 
Floor plans illustrating the incremental development of West Block are at Figure 26, Figure 27, Figure 28 
and Figure 29.

World War II, 1940-45 
The most radical alterations to Murdoch’s original design occurred as a consequence of World War II, 
which triggered a significant influx of civil servants to Canberra.  A key implication for West Block was 
the expansion of the Cables Branch.  
In January 1943, Prime Minister Curtin wrote to the Minister of the Interior, J S Collins, expressing 
concern at overcrowded working conditions in West Block.  The increase in the number of staff in the 
Cables Branch was highlighted as particular problem.67  It was also noted that the increased number of 
female employees during wartime meant that the toilet facilities had become inadequate.   
A Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works report in 1943 noted that while small additions 
had been made, with the conversion of corridors and balconies into offices, more space was required.  
Several solutions were proposed, including enclosing the courtyards to the east and west of A Block, 
adding an additional story to the building; extending West Block to the north; and the erection of a new 
temporary building for the cables section (Figure 19).68  By June 1943, Cabinet decided that a brick 
addition to the south-west of the building should be considered, ‘comprising first, second and part of 
third floor, level with an in architectural harmony with the existing building’.69  This directive was 
delivered in the form of D Block (1944), a new wing at the south end of the longitudinal axis designed in 
the same architectural style as the original building (Figure 20).  The original occupant of D Block was the 
Department of External Affairs.   
With the construction of D Block, the pneumatic tube connections that were installed in 1940-41 to 
connect the Provisional Parliament House with the Secretariat buildings were moved to the wing. The 
original sending and receiving terminal was located on the first-floor east corner of B Block, connecting 
underground to the first floor of East Block. 70   A second pneumatic tube service then connected East 
Block to Parliament House.  The connection was altered in 1944 to connect to the second floor of the 
east corner of D Block (see drawings in Appendix B).  It is possible that the underground tubes, or 
sections of them, survive, but no investigation has been undertaken.  
In 1945, the courtyard entrance to the east of B Block was enclosed and an automatic telephone 
exchange installed.  The alteration created the present configuration of a light well between the new 
office space and the central lobby in B Block.  In 1946, the open courtyard to the west of B Block was 
similarly enclosed to create a new cruciform lobby and entrance to the building (Figure 21).  This change 
resulted in the present configuration, although the signage on the western elevation has since changed 
from ‘Commonwealth Offices West Block’ to simply ‘West Block’ (Figure 22).

The Dugout 
Air raid shelters and trenches were introduced within the Parliamentary Triangle in 1942, following the 
fall of Singapore (February 1942).  Early in 1943, one of the air raid shelters, dug into the embankment 
east of West Block, was adapted to accommodate a Typex cypher machine, used for coding and 
decoding cables (Figure 23).  The Typex machine enabled Prime Minister John Curtin to communicate 
directly with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and American President Franklin Roosevelt.  It was 
accommodated in a freestanding structure because of the highly sensitive nature of the cables.  In 1944, 
a metal staircase was added to the rear (east) elevation of West Block, to enable direct transfer of 
cables between the two buildings (Figure 24).  
In 1945, no longer required to accommodate secret cables or provide shelter during an air attack, the 
former air raid shelter was adapted for use as an electrical substation in 1945, a use that it still serves.

Post-World War II 1946-60s 
After the end of the war, the building was still undergoing expansion.  Despite the creation of additional 
office space in the enclosing of the courtyards in B Block, the building required further expansion.  The 
major change was extensions made to A Block in 1948.  The eastern and western sides were extended 
out to match the massing of the newly constructed D Block (Figure 25).   
After the major renovations in the 1940s, only small changes were made to the building in the 1950s 
and 1960s.  A private telephone exchange was installed in 1949, and in 1951, tenders were called for the 
installation of automatic gear to modernise the building’s lifts.71  
In 1961, the balcony areas were further modified and in 1968, a top flight of stairs was removed from B

Refurbishment, 1970s-80s 
By the 1970s, the building was in need of refurbishment.  In the mid-1970s a Cabinet budget submission 
for $5 million was made for the construction of an office block annex to West Block, to provide 
additional accommodation for the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet.72  It was ultimately 
withdrawn and replaced by another submission, however the supporting documents describe the space 
pressures of West Block occupants.  At this time, the Department occupied approximately 7,250 square 
metres, in addition to another 1,020 square metres at three other locations in Canberra.  Another 930 
square metres of West Block were also occupied by the Commonwealth Actuary and the Royal 
Commission on Security and Intelligence.73  The submission outlined the Prime Minister’s proposal to 
make West Block the permanent location of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet and a desire 
to undertake a large-scale refurbishment of the building.  
West Block was vacant from late 1977 until 1979, after an appraisal found that the office 
accommodation was substandard, with poor fire protection and electrical services.74  During this period, 
the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet was moved to the Edmund Barton Building.  West Block’s 
location near both the provisional Parliament House and the proposed location of the new permanent 
Parliament House ensured that it continued to be used as government administration building.  
A Cabinet Paper in 1978 furthered the proposal from the first budget submission and ultimately resulted 
in the 1980s refurbishment of West Block.  This refurbishment was the second major period of change 
for the building and was undertaken for the Department of Administrative Services by architects, Fowell, 
Mansfield, Jarvis and Maclurcan.  The original steel windows and the later wooden frames on balcony 
infill windows, were replaced with low profile aluminium frame windows.  A National Trust assessment 
of the building in 1986 noted that the introduction of single pane windows dramatically altered the 
external appearance of the building.75   
The enclosed courts of B Block were covered by glazed tubular steel framed hipped roofs and is entry 
lobby was rearranged.  Balcony areas were again modified, and office space converted to open plan.  
Internal joinery was changed to updated to more closely match the original stained timber and brass 
fittings.  The first and second floors over the east link to the north building were infilled and the building 
was upgraded to include fire doors.  In the mid-1980s, the building was occupied by the Department of 
the Special Minister of State and the Economic Planning Advisory Council.

Recent history, 1988-present  
After the permanent Parliament House was opened in 1988, the requirement for West Block to provide 
accommodation for the departments was superseded by the purpose-built accommodation in the new 
building.  The close proximity to the provisional Parliament House was no longer a central feature of the

location of West Block.  Equally, the size of government and its supporting administration had also 
outgrown the extent of the West Block and has continued to expand.   
A review of the Parliamentary Zone by the National Capital Authority in 2000 predicted that the working 
population of Parliament House was probably close to twenty-five percent higher than it was predicted 
to be in the 1980s.76  It highlighted the possibility of using the carparks of East and West Block on either 
side of Federation Mall to accommodate the required growth, predicting the need for three storey 
buildings, with multilevel basement car parking desirable.77  
When the National Capital Plan was updated in 2016, the first comprehensive review since 1991, the use 
of the carparks was reaffirmed.78   The proposed amendments included a recommendation to change 
the zoning of the land within the Parliamentary Triangle, specifically of West Block and East Block, to 
allow for commercial uses such as hotels and offices.79  
In 2015, a scoping study was undertaken by the Federal Government, which considered the future of six 
government-owned buildings within the Parliamentary Triangle.  The possibility of private ownership of 
the six buildings – the John Gorton building, Treasury building, ANZAC Park East, ANZAC Park West and 
the two former Secretariat buildings – was considered in the review.80   The study recommended that 
four of the six buildings could be considered for private ownership – the two ANZAC Park buildings and 
East and West Block.81   
The proposal to sell the four public buildings was met with some concern from the community, 
particularly relating to the two former Secretariat buildings.  Historical societies and heritage groups 
expressed concern about the change of the buildings within the Parliamentary Triangle to private 
ownership, with the Griffin Society questioning whether the integrity of the Parliamentary Triangle was 
threatened by the sale.82  Territory politicians also questioned the sale and in September 2017, the ACT 
Government passed a motion to work with Federal Government to explore alternatives to the outright 
sale of the buildings.83   
Despite the community concern, West Block was the first building to sell, with Geocon purchasing the 
property for $6.25 million in September 2017.  The two ANZAC Park buildings and East Block were sold 
in December 2017, for a combined $122.5 million, including a development site on Constitution Ave.84   
In 2018, the new owners Geocon, were presented with a $100,000 sculpture of Winston Churchill 
honouring the historic links between West Block and the secret communications during World War II.85

Existing conditions  
The following provides a description of West Block, the Dugout and their setting as they existed in 
May/June 2018.   
2.10.1 
Site overview  
West Block is an office building that comprises a series of four three-storey wings (or blocks) of varying 
footprint connected on a north-south axis. – A Block is at the north, with D Block at the south.  There is a 
triangular at-grade car park to the west of the building, which is contemporary with the site’s 
establishment and is within Block 3, Section 23 Parkes (part).  A larger car park to the east of West Block, 
which dates from the late-1950s and is located on higher ground, is not within the site boundary.  
An embankment (c. 3m high) to the east of the main building dates to c. 1926, when the site was 
partially levelled.  The Dugout, a 1942 air raid shelter that has been in use as a substation since 1945, is 
built into the embankment, as is a gas main screened by a brick enclosure (built in the 1980s).  The 
asymmetrical site slopes approximately five metres down from east to west, following the gradient of 
Camp Hill.    
The immediate interfaces of the subject site are as follows:  
 
To the north of the site is Queen Victoria Terrace (originally Kingston Street), with the enclosed 
rose garden of the Provisional Parliament House to the north-east.  The north elevation of A 
Block is set back approximately 15 metres from Queen Victoria Terrace; 
 
A modern slip road giving access to State Circle from Commonwealth Avenue is to the south, 
with a very shallow set-back from D Block (approximately three metres at its closest point); 
 
To the east, at the top of the embankment, is the c. late-1950s car park, which was extended to 
its present dimensions in the 1980s; and 
 
Commonwealth Avenue is to the west, with Embassies and High Commissions on the west side 
of the Avenue.   
There is a service road to the west of the West Block, separating the building from the triangular car 
park.  This has been a cul-de-sac since the late-1980s, but originally extended to Commonwealth 
Avenue.  Access to the rear (east) of West Block is via a sealed laneway to the north of A Block.  
Remnants of the formal 1920s landscape treatment, including mature deciduous trees and some 
hedges, are evident to the north and east of the subject site, addressing both sides of Queen Victoria 
Terrace and surrounding the triangular car park.  The native plantings to the south and south-east of 
West Block are generally more recent.   
The site includes no significant objects or items of moveable heritage.   
2.10.2 
West Block 
West Block is raised on a brick plinth, to bring the parapet up to approximately the same height (AHD 
581.1) as East Block, which is located 450 metres to the east.  The top of the parapet is approximately 
13.5 metres above ground level.  Small basement areas and rooftop plant are located to B and D Blocks, 
and a residence for the caretaker is centrally positioned on the roof of B Block.   
The building is constructed of load bearing brick.  The ground level is face brickwork, and the upper 
levels are finished in painted render surmounted by a prominent projecting cornice.  As built, the 
parapet concealed the roof.  Alterations carried out in the 1980s have resulted in the roof form being 
partly visible at the north end of the building (A Block).

While West Block was designed to be seen ‘in the round’, with each elevation maintaining the same 
language and proportions, in practice the west elevation is the building’s principal address, with 
services, outbuildings and the Dugout located to the rear. 
Blocks A, B and C (built in 1926-27) are carried on a reinforced concrete slab with reinforced concrete 
beams and columns – A, B and C Blocks are planned on a seven square foot grid (2.13m x 2.13m).   The 
upper levels are timber post and beam, with timber floor boards.  The extensive use of timber in the 
building was consistent with the temporary (or provisional) nature of the building.86  D Block, which was 
built in 1944, is all concrete. 
The entrances, the corner verandahs (enclosed in 1937-38) and the internal elevations of the full-height 
light wells are formed with semicircular brick arches.  This approach originally extended to the forecourt 
screens to either side of B Block, removed in the 1940s.  Openings on the upper levels are rectangular 
and have flat brick lintels.  Verandah railings featured simple Greek-inspired patterns  
Changes to the building over time have generally sought to create more office space while minimising 
impacts on the external appearance.  This approach was generally compatible with Murdoch’s analysis 
of the Modern Renaissance style, which he considered to be reliant on ‘proportions and lines rather 
than details’ (see Section 2.4.1).  Key formal characteristics of the evolved building exterior include: 
symmetrical massing, division into vertical bays and an overall sense of visual coherence derived from a 
consistency of materials and a uniform parapet line.  
Changes dating to the 1930s and 1940s were generally reverential to the original design.  Later changes, 
including works to the interior, were driven by functional requirements and budgetary prudence.  The 
original finishes have either been removed or concealed by the 1981/82 fit out.  A Block was originally 
open plan, to accommodate the National Library.  B and C Blocks were fitted out as office space.  
Mechanical, hydraulic and electrical services have been updated over time.   
A summary of key alterations to the exterior of West Block is at Table 2, and details of original elements 
and fabric to the building interior are at Table 3.

was inverted in the 1940s, 
when the recessed loggia was 
replaced with a three-level 
infill projecting from the main 
building line.  These works 
also resulted in the loss of the 
original screen wall, with 
three punched arch-headed 
openings.  The original 
external elevation of the 
central bay is extant within 
the enclosed courtyard.   
The introduction of sun 
shading to the west elevation 
was an early change, and 
there have been at least two 
iterations of pull down 
awnings in boxed casings at 
the building over time (since 
removed).  Penetrations and

these awnings are evident

with aluminium frames 
throughout (1980s). 
The gradient of the land to

operation of the east 
elevation as the rear (or

In terms of loss of fabric, the

comparable to the west 
elevation, with the principal 
change being the replacement

The Dugout 
A single-storey brick air raid shelter was constructed in the embankment to the east of West Block in 
1941/42, almost aligned to the central east-west axis of B Block.  It was part of the World War II era 
defences introduced within the Parliamentary Zone. 
At the beginning of 1943, the shelter was adapted to accommodate a Typex cypher machine, used for 
coding and decoding cables.  Documentation dated 30 December 1942 indicates that a small brick 
addition was constructed to the rear to accommodate ventilation and heating plant (Figure 23).  The 
Typex machine enabled Prime Minister John Curtin to communicate directly with British Prime Minister 
Winston Churchill and American President Franklin Roosevelt.  It was accommodated in a freestanding 
structure because of the highly sensitive nature of the cables.

The building was adapted as a sub-substation in 1945 and all equipment associated with its war-time 
use is assumed to have been removed.  Today the single-storey building includes two 500kVa 
transformers.87 
A brick screen wall mimicking the composition of the original screen walls to B Block was constructed to 
the west of the Dugout in the early 1980s, and bike storage provided behind the screen.  The substation 
was also extended, to the south, at that time (Figure 31 and Figure 32).   
The building has been re-roofed (metal sheeting) and over-painted.  In its present form, it conveys 
nothing of its war time origins or uses.

Landscaped setting  
The following provides a summary of key landscape attributes at West Block, specifically those dating to 
the 1920s treatment for West Block and its setting.  A summary of plantings surviving from the 1920s 
landscape treatment is at Table 4. 
Structural elements  
The pathways around West Block, indicated on the 1928 landscape plan, have been subject to change 
over time, in terms of their extent and alignment.  However, a number of key structural elements of the 
landscape are extant, including:  
 
The integral car park between Commonwealth Avenue and West Block – although an original 
entry to the car park from Queen Victoria Terrace has been closed  
 
The service road between West Block and the car park – this road originally returned to 
Commonwealth Avenue, and was modified to a cul-de-sac in the 1980s 
 
The tree-lined vista extending north of the subject site on axis with the north elevation of A 
Block (Figure 33) 
Landscape character 
North and west of West Block: There is a mixed plantation of exotic specimens to the north and west of 
West Block, including around the integral car park, which is now enclosed by a hedge.  There have been 
notable changes to the density and diversity of the plantings.  However, as described in Section 2.4.3, 
there is a clear correlation between the existing elements and the 1928 plan of permanent plantings 
(see Figure 11 and Appendix B), as well as with the photographic record of a maturing planted landscape 
as captured in archival photography available from the National Archives of Australia.  Surviving and 
reconstituted plantings maintain the spatial arrangements established in the plantings specified and laid 
out by Charles Weston. 
East and south-east of West Block: Remnants of the indigenous woodland were retained on Mount 
Kurrajong and Camp Hill in the 1920s, supplemented by the planting of new native trees, shrubs and 
groundcovers.  Despite significant changes in this area over time, including the addition of the new 
Parliament House and the land bridge connecting the old and new Parliament houses across Camp Hill, 
this rationale endures (Figure 34).  
West of West Block: The original plantings to the median strip and to either side of Commonwealth 
Avenue have been removed, relating to the major road works completed in the late-1980s.  However, 
retained Atlantic cedar trees and a Giant redwood within the inner band of planting adjacent to the car 
park are suggestive of the original treatment of the larger avenue.

Views and visual relationships  
The planned relationship between East and West blocks and the Provisional Parliament House is best 
appreciated from the air.  As experienced at ground level, the distance between East and West blocks, 
as well as the tree plantings and the natural camber of the land (originally Camp Hill and now Federation 
Mall, the land bridge between the Provisional and permanent parliament houses), means that East Block 
is essentially imperceptible from West Block (Figure 35).  The rear of the Provisional Parliament House 
is, however, visible to the north-east.  
The clearest views of West Block today are from Commonwealth Avenue (Figure 36 and Figure 37).   
The north elevation of West Block also remains the southern terminal view for the formal axial pathway 
which extends through the Parliamentary Gardens north of Queen Victoria Terrace (Figure 38).

ASSESSMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE  
This chapter provides an assessment of the cultural heritage values associated with West Block against 
the Commonwealth Heritage criteria.  It draws on evidence presented in Chapter 2 ‘Understanding the 
Place’.  An assessment of the place against the CHL criteria is at Section 3.4, and the CHL ‘Summary 
Statement of Significance’ and ‘Official Values’ for West Block and the Dugout are reviewed at Section 
3.5.1.  
The assessment has regard for the definitions of values in the ‘Understanding and assessing cultural 
significance’ Practice Note to the Burra Charter 2013.  Of the five values identified in the Burra Charter 
(historic, aesthetic, social, spiritual and scientific) it is considered that historic and aesthetic values are of 
greatest relevance to West Block, as discussed below.  
3.1 
Assessment of historic value  
The ‘Understanding and assessing cultural significance’ Practice Note to the Burra Charter 2013 provides 
the following definition of historic value: 
Historic value is intended to encompass all aspects of history – for example, the 
history of aesthetics, art and architecture, science, spirituality and society.  It 
therefore often underlies other values.  A place may have historic value because it 
has influenced, or has been influenced by, an historic event, phase, movement or 
activity, person or group of people.  It may be the site of an important event.  For 
any place the significance will be greater where the evidence of the association or 
event survives at the place, or where the setting is substantially intact, than where 
it has been changed or evidence does not survive.  However, some events or 
associations may be so important that the place retains significance regardless of 
such change or absence of evidence. 
To help understand the historic value of a place, ask: 
> 
Is the place associated with an important event or theme in history? 
> 
Is the place important in showing patterns in the development of history 
locally, in a region, or on a state-wide, or national or global basis?  
> 
Does the place show a high degree of creative or technical achievement for a 
particular period?   
> 
Is the place associated with a particular person or cultural group important in 
the history of the local area, state, nationally or globally? 
Historic value as related to West Block includes consideration of: 
 
The association between West Block, and the Parliament House Secretariat group generally, 
with the Federation of the Australian colonies;  
 
The association between the Parliament House Secretariat group and the establishment of 
Canberra as the national capital; 
 
The Dugout as evidence of a strategic means of communication between Australia and her allies 
during World War II; and  
 
Associations between West Block and individuals and organisations who have made notable 
contributions both to the establishment of Canberra and to processes of Government.

3.1.1 
The Commonwealth of Australia  
Even before Australia became a federated nation, the requirement for a national capital was apparent in 
the colonies.  Political steps were to be taken to choose the capital using grand ideas of democracy.  The 
intent was to create a federal capital free from the political or commercial domination of any single 
state or colony.88 
The Australasian Federation Conference (Melbourne, 1890) and National Australasian Convention 
(Sydney, 1891) were held to determine how the colonies should federate, but were fraught with inter-
colonial rivalry.  The location of the future national capital was the source of heated debate during the 
1890s, but the ultimate decision was left to the future parliament following federation.   
The coastal locations of all of the colony’s capital cities was considered a potential security risk, so an 
inland location was suggested.  By the time of the National Australasian conventions in 1897-98, there 
was consideration that the selected site should be ‘central, accessible, defensible and healthy’.89 
Although there are twentieth century capital cities around the world that are comparable to Canberra in 
terms of expressing progressive and nationally-specific urban planning principles, the creation of 
Canberra is unique in that it was the first example ‘[in the] history of the world when one nation has 
owned a whole continent and has been able to create a city of its own will for the purpose of a 
capital’.90  
Further, the design and planning of Canberra as the administrative and political centre of the country 
embodied aspirations as a national showcase.  The city was intended to represent Australian design in 
the twentieth century, and to be understood as a ‘model city’ made by the people of Australia to show 
the world.  
The Parliament House Secretariat group, including West Block, provides tangible evidence of federation.  
The group was purpose-built to facilitate the operation of the Commonwealth Government following 
the decision to relocate the operations of government from Melbourne to Canberra.   
While West Block, East Block and the Provisional Parliament House have been subject to incremental 
change over time, related in the main to changes of use and occupants, the buildings and their planned, 
historical and architectural relationships remain unchanged. 
3.1.2 
Canberra as the National Capital 
By 1925, when the FCC assumed responsibility for relocating Parliament to Canberra, the ‘bush capital’ 
had become a small country town.  As noted at Chapter 2, the FCC was charged with – among other 
tasks – relocating departments and public servants from the capital cities of Australia (primarily 
Melbourne and Sydney) to the infant capital.  The next two years saw a flurry of activity and decision-
making, and the federal Parliament officially opened in Canberra on 9 May 1927, 26 years to the day 
after the opening of the first federal Parliament in Melbourne. 
In its planning and composition, the Parliament House Secretariat group provides evidence of this 
intense period of development in the new capital.  In many respects, the completion of the grouping 
represented the culmination of Canberra’s ‘establishment’ (or ‘inaugural’) phase’.  Further, the scale of 
West Block and East Block provides an insight into the times.  For a period of more than 50 years, these 
two buildings were the epicentre of Australian Parliamentary bureaucracy and were fundamental to the 
administration of Federal political power.   
The Parliament House Secretariat group were also the first buildings completed in the Parliamentary 
Triangle, the central feature of the Griffin’s plan for the city.  While Griffin’s plan was not implemented 
as per his vision, some characteristics were delivered including: the siting of Old Parliament House on

the Land Axis with expansive views to the north, and the symmetrical positioning of departmental 
offices to either side of the Land Axis.   
The construction of a group of buildings for the administration of a territory, region or State in Australia 
is uncommon.  A more typical sequence is for the construction of a principal parliament (or equivalent) 
building, with support facilities delivered incrementally over a period of time as required.  An exception 
to this pattern is the Commonwealth and State offices group in Brisbane, also planned and designed by J 
S Murdoch.  The context in Canberra was, of course, unique with Canberra being the only Australian city 
designed and constructed to function as the political and governmental centre of the nation. 
3.1.3 
The Dugout 
In 1942, following the Japanese attacks on Darwin, trenches were dug within the Provisional Parliament 
House precinct, including to the south-east of West Block.  Air raid shelters were also provided, 
including one in the embankment to the east of West Block.  The embankment was partially dug out to 
enable construction and, presumably, to provide some degree of blast protection.   
The air raid shelter was of standard design and construction, with a narrow central chamber and flanked 
at either end by deeper entries (see Figure 28).   
At the beginning of 1943, the air raid shelter was adapted to accommodate a Typex cypher machine, 
used for coding and decoding cables – the Cables Department was based at West Block.  The machine 
enabled Prime Minister John Curtin to communicate directly with British Prime Minister Winston 
Churchill and American President Franklin Roosevelt.  It was accommodated in a freestanding structure 
because of the highly sensitive nature of the cables.

The building was adapted as a substation in 1945, following World War II.   
The Dugout provides tangible evidence of a strategic means of communication between Australia and 
her allies during World War II.  It also provides evidence of the defence measures that were introduced 
in Canberra during World War II.  The building as it presents today conveys nothing of its war time uses.  
3.1.4 
Associations 
In reflecting on historical value, the Burra Charter Practice Note encourages consideration of a site’s 
association with a people or groups that are ‘important in the history of the local area, state, nationally 
or globally’.   
West Block is associated with: 
 
J S Murdoch, Chief Architect of the Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways.  
Murdoch’s Department was responsible for the three buildings within the group, as well as a 
great many others in Canberra in the period leading up the end of the 1920s.  Murdoch has been 
credited with the development of the Federal Capital style, of which West Block, East Block and 
the Provisional Parliament House were early examples (see also Section 3.2.1).  Murdoch also 
expressed strong views about the landscape treatment for the Parliamentary precinct and is 
credited with the selection of poplars for the principal intersections and boundaries.   
 
Charles Weston, officer-in-charge of Afforestation (later Parks and Gardens) at the national 
capital from 1913 to 1926.  Weston established nurseries and propagated plants suited to the 
conditions in Canberra.  He also oversaw the planting and landscape development of the city.  
His varied concepts and approaches are expressed in the divergent characters of the landscape 
to all sides of West Block. See Section 2.4.4 in Chapter 2).  
 
Walter Burley Griffin, winner of the international competition for the design of the federal 
capital and Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction from 1913 to 1920.  As noted, 
Griffin’s plans for the Parliament House group were implemented to the extent that he 
envisaged the Parliamentary Triangle as the seat of government, and for buildings within the 
triangle to be sited symmetrically on either side of the Land Axis.   
3.2 
Assessment of aesthetic value 
The ‘Understanding and assessing cultural significance’ Practice Note to the Burra Charter 2013 provides 
the following definition of aesthetic value: 
Aesthetic value refers to the sensory and perceptual experience of a place—that is, 
how we respond to visual and non-visual aspects such as sounds, smells and other 
factors having a strong impact on human thoughts, feelings and attitudes.  
Aesthetic qualities may include the concept of beauty and formal aesthetic ideals.  
Expressions of aesthetics are culturally influenced. 
In considering aesthetic value, ask: 
> Does the place have special compositional or uncommonly attractive qualities 
involving combinations of colour, textures, spaces, massing, detail, movement, 
unity, sounds, scents? 
> Is the place distinctive within the setting or a prominent visual landmark? 
> Does the place have qualities which are inspirational or which evoke strong 
feelings or special meanings? 
Authorised Version F2022L00620 registered 20/04/2022

ASSESSMENT 
L O V EL L  C H EN

> Is the place symbolic for its aesthetic qualities: for example, does it inspire 
artistic or cultural response, is it represented in art, photography, literature, 
folk art, folk lore, mythology or other imagery or cultural arts? 
> Does the place display particular aesthetic characteristics of an identified style 
or fashion? 
> Does the place show a high degree of creative or technical achievement? 
In the case of West Block, the aesthetic values of the place are considered to be: 
 
Architectural, deriving from the design qualities of West Block itself, as well as its formal 
relationship with East Block and the Provisional Parliament House; and  
 
Aesthetic, relating to the landscaped setting.  
3.2.1 
The Federal Capital style 
Alongside East Block and the Provisional Parliament house, West Block is an early example of the 
Federal Capital style, a term used to describe early Canberra architecture (the period from 1913 to 
World War II).  The name derives from the Federal Capital Commission, the government agency 
responsible for the construction and administration of Canberra from 1 January 1925 to 1 May 1930, 
when it was disbanded.   
Buildings overseen by the FCC during its first two years of operation (1925-1927) included the 
Provisional Parliament house, East Block and West Block (designed by the Commonwealth Department 
of Works and Railways, of which John Smith Murdoch was Chief Architect), the Lodge (Oakley and 
Parkes), Albert Hall (J Hunter Kirkpatrick), Mount Stromlo Observatory (Murdoch, Figure 40), the 
Forestry School (Kirkpatrick) and the Melbourne and Sydney buildings (John Sulman, Figure 42).   
Federal Capital architecture was generally conservative in character; the flamboyance of the Federation 
era was not seen to be appropriate to the federal capital.  It was also delivered in a climate of financial 
constraint, where the private sector had little interest in the construction of the ‘bush capital’.   
As noted by Ken Charlton, author of Federal Capital Architecture, Canberra 1911-1939, the Federal 
Capital style was a synthesis of revivalist styles (neo-Georgian, Colonial Revival and later Tudor Revival), 
interwar stripped classicism and overseas influences (including Spanish Mission, the Prairie Style, 
Stripped Classicism and Art Deco).91  Major figures in the development of the Federal Capital included: 
 
Sir John Sulman (1849-1934), an architect active in the Arts and Crafts movement in England 
before emigrating to Australia in 1885.  He was influential in shaping ideas on town planning in 
Australian the years leading to Canberra’s inception.  He served as chairman of the Federal 
Capital Advisory Committee (predecessor to the FCC) from 1921 to 1924; 
 
Leslie Wilkinson (1882-1973), Australia’s first Professor of Architecture and a noted advocate of 
climate responsive design; 
 
William Hardy Wilson (1881-1955), an influential architect and writer who was a proponent of 
Colonial Revival architecture.  His seminal work, Colonial architecture in New South Wales and 
Tasmania was published in 1924; 
 
Walter Burley Griffin (1876-1937), an exponent of Prairie style design principles; and  
 
John Smith Murdoch (1862-1945), Australia’s first Commonwealth Government Architect, and 
designer of a number of key works in Canberra’s Inaugural Phase (1911-1927) 
While not the earliest examples of buildings in the Federal Capital style, the Parliament House 
Secretariat group performed a significant role in refining and consolidating the style.  This arose as a

consequence of the buildings being the seat of government and being the first buildings in the 
Parliamentary Triangle.   
Further, as a pragmatic and well-resolved solution to the challenge of accommodating a variety of 
official uses and operations quickly, West Block (and East Block) can be seen as representative of the 
times.  The buildings are architecturally unpretentious and designed in a style that could accommodate 
change and alterations without detrimental impact on its formal presentation.

3.2.2 
Landscaped setting  
As noted by Professor Ken Taylor, a former professor of landscape architecture at Canberra University 
and author of Canberra, City in the Landscape (2006), the years leading up to the development of 
Canberra saw the, ‘birth of the town and country planning movement as the forerunner of modern 
urban planning’.92  During this period two planning principles dominated: the City Beautiful movement 
and the Garden City movement.  Although distinct in emphasis and expression the two shared common 
objectives, specifically a rejection of the squalid and unhealthy living conditions created by unplanned 
and opportunistic urban development that proliferated during the Industrial Revolution. 
The City Beautiful movement, informed by Renaissance planning principles, was concerned with urban 
aesthetics and order.  It is characterised by axes and vistas lined with monumental civic buildings 
connecting gardens and public spaces.  A leading proponent of City Beautiful principles at the end of the 
nineteenth century was American architect and urban planner Daniel Burnham.  The influence of 
Burnham’s plan for the 1893 World Columbian Exposition in Chicago on a young Walter Burley Griffin 
has been well documented.93  The Exposition plan was distinguished by a strong sense of geometry, 
tree-lined boulevards, axes lined with classical buildings and a central water court.  Burnham 
subsequently worked on the McMillan Commission (1901), which resulted in the completion of the 
National Mall in Washington DC and in 1909 he prepared a comprehensive city plan for Chicago, 
described by Professor Taylor as having, ‘an emphasis on civic design, a system of highways and 
avenues, public transport and a great park system’.94 
The emphasis of the Garden City movement, as promoted by English reformer Ebenezer Howard from 
the late 1890s, was on achieving a balance between contemporary urban forms and traditional patterns 
of rural settlement.  Hygiene and cleanliness were dominant precepts, and locations on the urban fringe 
were identified as ideal locations to demonstrate the benefits of Garden City principles. 
The centre point of Howard’s ideal garden city was a large circular public park.  Avenues radiating from 
the park were linked by concentric streets, lined with residential development.  The central ring (Grand 
Avenue) was a broad linear green space (Figure 43).  Throughout the city, public open spaces and 
private gardens contributed to the health and welfare of residents.  The underpinning principle was of 
urban planning as an instrument of social reform.  Further underpinning the urban planning philosophy 
was an ideal to introduce ‘nature’ into the new city.  With both the British Garden City and the City 
Beautiful (particularly as interpreted in Europe), a key component in the successful implementation of 
the planning model was landscape architecture.  In the case of Canberra, on the treeless Limestone 
Plains, the design and planting of the landscape was critical.

Charles Weston 
Charles Weston was appointed Horticulturalist Superintendent of Parks, Gardens and Afforestation in 
Canberra (later Superintendent Parks and Gardens) at the national capital.  He was simultaneously 
Director of City Planning from 1921-1926.  As noted, his work in Canberra can be divided into two 
phases: testing and propagation in the distinct conditions of the Limestone Plains; and planting. 
Tree trials were conducted at the Acton Nursery (now submerged by Lake Burley Griffin) over a period 
of several years.  Other trial sites which remain as a record of Weston’s approach include Westbourne 
Woods and Yarralumla Nursery.  In the trial plantings, Weston tested both exotic and native species   At 
Westbourne Woods one section was, ‘an exclusive area for the cultivation of our Australian trees etc, 
and to demonstrate the tractability of such to cultivation and not leave such object lessons to South 
Africa and California’.95  The second was for, ‘trees that create the glorious Spring and Autumn effects 
for which the cool temperate countries of the world are justly noted’.96  The third was, ‘to bring 
together a magnificent collection of trees and sub-trees which are included under the name of conifers 
or cone bearers’.97 
Weston sought to define the new city through plantings, rather than through buildings.  It was 
recognised that planting could define the ground plane of the city much more quickly that the building 
program could, particularly given the financial constraints of the period.  Expenditure on capital works in 
Canberra was cut from £101,533 in 1916-17 to £8,000 over the next three years,98 and in the years to 
1924, Australia invested only £3.4million in the development of Canberra.99 ‘ 
In general, Weston favoured conifers as a key structure planting.  In 1917 he stated that three cedars, 
Deodar, Atlas and Lebanon (Cedrus deodara, C. atlantica and C. libani) would be useful as the chief 
arboreal feature of the city.100  He also pioneered the use of several eucalypts such as Brittle Gum 
(Eucalyptus mannifera) and Argyle Apple (Eucalyptus cinerea); 36 species of eucalypts were trialled at 
Yarralumla in 1917. 
The landscape treatment delivered by Weston at the Parliamentary precinct established the template 
for Canberra’s interpretation of ‘Garden City’ principles.  The treatment was formal and used plantings 
to frame vistas, define boundaries and create ‘outdoor rooms’.  The treatments around East and West 
blocks operated on two levels: as self-contained landscape settings for the buildings in their own right, 
including triangular car parks as landscaped buffers from the main axes; and as components of the 
larger landscape setting, to which they are connected in terms of symmetry and by means of the tree-
lined vistas extending from their northern-most blocks.

Assessment of social value 
The ‘Understanding and assessing cultural significance’ Practice Note to the Burra Charter 2013 provides 
the following definition of scientific value: 
Social value refers to the associations that a place has for a particular community or 
cultural group and the social or cultural meanings that it holds for them.101 
The social value of a heritage place has been described as, ‘the special meanings attached to places by 
groups of people (rather than by individuals)’.102  A critical consideration in establishing the social 
significance of a place is its value to the present community.  This sense of communal attachment is 
typically associated with places that are publicly accessible, or have otherwise been, ‘appropriated into 
the daily lives of people’.103  Places recognised as having social value include those that: 
 
Provide a spiritual or traditional connection between past and present 
 
Tie the past affectionately to the present 
 
Help give a disempowered group back its history 
 
Provide an essential reference point in a community’s identity or sense of itself 
 
Loom large in the daily comings and goings of life 
 
Provide an essential community function that over time develops into a deeper attachment 
that is more than utility value 
 
Have shaped some aspect of community behaviour or attitudes 
 
Are distinctive – the old clock tower in a town or an architectural folly – features that lift a 
place above the crowd, making it likely that special meanings have been attached to that place

 
Are accessible to the public and offer the possibility of repeated use to build up associations 
and value to the community of users 
 
Places where people gather and act as a community, for example places of public ritual, public 
meeting or congregation, and informal gathering places104 
Indications of a community’s attachment to a place might be reflected in a history of communal action 
to protect the place from development; inclusion in local walking tours; and representation in postcards 
or websites for the area.   
Social significance or value is typically established through community consultation, sometimes in the 
form of survey questionnaires, interviews with members of the relevant communities or public 
discussion workshops.  Opinion pieces in the local print media, and views expressed in talk-back radio 
shows can also be forums for the expression of community sentiment.  Community consultation is rarely 
a ‘scientific’ process, although it is generally the case that the broader the cross-section of the 
community invited to express opinions, the greater the certainty about the outcomes.   
As noted at Chapter 1, no formal appraisal of social values was undertaken in the course of this HMP.  
Such a process has the potential to indicate that a community or group has some degree of social 
attachment to the building.  However, that is not considered to be sufficiently probable to warrant the 
undertaking.  Places or work (like an office) and utility (like a supermarket) are not typically considered 
to be places of social value.  In general terms, they do not relate to or express a ritual or ceremonial 
function that stimulates a strong sense of attachment.   
Further, in the context of the Parliament House Secretariat group (which includes the Provisional 
Parliament House, East Block and West Block), it is considered the communal attachment associated 
with the ceremonial functions of the governance of the nation is more likely to reside in the Provisional 
Parliament House than either East or West Block, which provided a supporting role for the operations of 
Parliament.  
3.4 
Assessment against Commonwealth Heritage criteria 
Having regard to the above analysis, the following assessment against the Commonwealth Heritage 
criteria.  
(a) the place has significant heritage value because of the place's importance in the course, or 
pattern, of Australia's natural or cultural history 
West Block (designed in 1925, built in 1926-27 and in use from August 1927) is of historical significance 
to Australia for its association with Federation.  The building is a component of the Parliament House 
Secretariat group, the first premises purpose-built for Australia’s democratic government.  The principal 
component of the group is the Provisional Parliament House itself, as reflected in its siting on the Land 
Axis and its visual prominence within the national capital.  West and East blocks (originally Secretariats 
no. 2 and 1 respectively) were supporting elements.  The primary role of these multi-purpose buildings 
was office accommodation.  The buildings within the Parliament House Secretariat group were the first 
to be constructed within the Parliamentary Triangle.  All were conceived as temporary, pending the 
construction of a permanent Parliament House, completed in 1988. 
The Dugout (built 1942, adapted in 1943 and 1945) is of historical significance as the building from 
which Prime Minister Curtin communicated with Australia’s allies during World War II, using a Typex 
cypher machine.  The building is also significant as a remnant of the World War II defences introduced 
within the Parliamentary Zone during World War II.

(b) the place has significant heritage value because of the place's possession of uncommon, rare or 
endangered aspects of Australia's natural or cultural history 
The construction of a group of buildings for the administration of a territory, region or State in Australia 
is uncommon.  The contextual rationale for this approach is of historical significance to Australia (see 
Criterion A above).   
The origins and evolution of Canberra as a purpose-built capital city in an isolated bush setting is a 
singular phenomenon in Australia, and demanded an uncommon (unique) response to its planning, 
construction and development, including the construction of a group of buildings for the practice and 
operation of government.  A more typical sequence is for the construction of a principal parliament 
building, with support facilities delivered incrementally over a period of time as required.  An exception 
to this pattern is the Commonwealth and State offices group in Adelaide Street, Brisbane (completed in 
1936), also planned and designed by J S Murdoch.   
(c) the place has significant heritage value because of the place's potential to yield information 
that will contribute to an understanding of Australia's natural or cultural history 
The subject site is not considered to satisfy this criterion.   
Block 3, Section 23 Parkes (part) was partially excavated in the mid-1920s, to establish a level site for the 
construction of West Block.  This activity, as well as grading works for the establishment of the integral 
car park and the landscape setting generally, means, there is limited potential for subsurface artefacts 
relating to earlier occupation and/or land use at the site.  Exceptions may relate to subsurface evidence 
of pneumatic tubes that connected the buildings of the Parliament House group during the 1940s, and 
evidence of World War II-era defences (i.e. trenches).  In the event that archaeological remains are 
discovered at the site, the relevant authorities should be informed before proceeding with work (see 
also Chapter 5, Policy 22).  
(d) the place has significant heritage value because of the place's importance in demonstrating the 
principal characteristics of: 
(1) a class of Australia's natural or cultural places; or 
(2) a class of Australia's natural or cultural environments; 
West Block is significant for demonstrating the principal characteristics of the Federal Capital style, a 
generally conservative and unpretentious synthesis of revivalist styles and overseas influences, including 
Stripped Classicism, which is now strongly associated with Canberra’s establishment phase.  
Distinguishing characteristics of the style evident in West Block today include: horizontal massing; 
symmetrical façades divided into vertical bays; and a simple, unpretentious architectural expression, 
with limited use of decorative elements.  Internal evidence of the building’s original/early (pre-1950s) 
character and layout is very limited.  Extant elements  and attributes include: the north-south axis that 
connects the four blocks on each level; the two staircases in B Block; timber ceiling panels where extant 
in A, B and C Blocks; and timber structural framing on levels 1 and 2, which provide an insight into the 
‘temporary’ (provisional) nature of the building.  
(e) the place has significant heritage value because of the place's importance in exhibiting 
particular aesthetic characteristics valued by a community or cultural group 
The setting of West Block, as part of the formal landscape for the Parliamentary Triangle, is of aesthetic 
significance to Australia.  The buildings that make up the Parliament House Secretariat group are 
symmetrically positioned within a large-scale landscape (the Parliamentary Triangle, south of King 
Edward Terrace) that was conceived in the 1920s as the centrepiece of the Federal Capital.  The 
landscape of the Parliamentary Triangle, although much altered, is of aesthetic significance.  The

formality of the planned landscape provides an appropriately distinguished setting for the Provisional 
Parliament House.  It also contributed to the establishment of Canberra’s ‘Garden City’ identity.   
(f) the place has significant heritage value because of the place's importance in demonstrating a 
high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period 
The planning and presentation of the Parliament House Secretariat group within the formal landscape of 
the Parliamentary precinct is of creative (technical) significance to Australia.   
The Secretariat group is located at the southern end of the Land Axis (Parliament House Vista), a key 
symbolic and planning component of Walter Burley Griffin’s concept for Australia’s federal capital.  The 
three buildings were designed by the office of J S Murdoch, Chief Architect of the Commonwealth 
Department of Works and Railways, and were sited to reinforce the formal qualities of the Land Axis.  
The landscape treatment was designed and planted by Thomas Weston, with input from Murdoch.  
Collectively, this composition is of creative significance.   
(g) the place has significant heritage value because of the place's strong or special association with 
a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons 
No evidence to indicate that West Block is of value to a particular community or cultural group came to 
light during research for this HMP.  Further, research revealed no evidence that would indicate that 
analysis of the potential for the building to be of social value to a particular community or cultural group 
is required.  This is consistent with the use of the building (office accommodation).  Places of work and 
utility are not typically considered to be of social value.  In general terms, they do not relate to or 
express a ritual or ceremonial function that stimulates a strong sense of attachment.  In the event that 
evidence indicating that West Block may be of social value to a particular community or cultural group 
were to be revealed this approach may be reviewed.   
(h) the place has significant heritage value because of the place's special association with the life or 
works of a person, or group of persons, of importance in Australia's natural or cultural history 
West Block is significant for its association with Walter Burley Griffin, J S Murdoch and Charles Weston.  
These figures made significant contributions to the planning, design and setting for the building.   
Griffin’s plan for Canberra established the city’s core structure and zoning.  His plans for the Parliament 
House group were implemented to the extent that he envisaged the Parliamentary Triangle as the seat 
of government, and for buildings within the triangle to be sited symmetrically on either side of the Land 
Axis.   
J S Murdoch, Chief Architect of the Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways, was responsible 
for the three buildings within the Parliament House Secretariat group.  Murdoch also expressed strong 
views about the landscape treatment for the Parliamentary precinct and is credited with the selection of 
poplars for the principal intersections and boundaries.   
Charles Weston, officer-in-charge of Afforestation (later Parks and Gardens) at the national capital, 
established nurseries and propagated plants suited to the conditions in Canberra.  He also oversaw the 
planting and landscape development of the city.  His varied concepts and approaches are expressed in 
the divergent characters of the landscape to all sides of West Block.    
(i) the place has significant heritage value because of the place's importance as part of Indigenous 
tradition. 
West Block does not satisfy this criterion.

Statement of significance 
For the purposes of this HMP, the existing CHL entry for West Block is accepted, including the gazetted 
Statement of Significance (transcribed below) and the ‘official’ values. 
3.5.1 
Summary Statement of Significance 
West Block is a significant component of the Parliament House Secretariat group, 
which also includes East Block and the Provisional Parliament House.  The group is 
located at the southern end of the Parliamentary Triangle and is an integral 
component of the significant Parliamentary Triangle landscape, exhibiting the 
skilful handling of planning and architectural forms within a designed landscape of 
related buildings and spaces.  The group forms essential and important axial 
planning elements with the Parliamentary Triangle.  The planning principles of the 
group are as established by Walter Burley Griffin, and the architectural resolution 
of the group is as established within the office of John Smith Murdoch, Director-
General of Works. (Criterion F1)  
West Block is important for its association with Federation, being part of the 
Provisional Parliament House group, which formed the essential Government 
facilities in the early development of Canberra as the Nation's Capital.  The 
Secretariats are a remnant of the relocation phase of the Federal Capital when they 
formed the seat of Federal and political power. (Criterion A4) Australian Historic 
Themes: 4.3, Developing Institutions, 7.4 Federating Australia.  
The Dugout is significant as a purpose-built World War II bomb shelter.  Along with 
West Block it is important for accommodating strategic international 
communication functions of Australia's war time activities. (Criterion 4) Australian 
Historic Themes 7.7 Defending Australia).  
The building is a fine example of Federal Capital Architecture, a version of Inter-
War Stripped Classical style.  It exhibits classical style proportions and features of 
arcaded entrance screens and courtyard arrival points. (Criterion D2) 
The unpretentious style of the building with its low horizontal massing, the role of 
the building as part of a group linked by architectural style and function, and the 
contribution of the building group as a feature of the designed landscape of the 
Parliamentary Triangle, are significant aesthetic qualities now greatly valued. 
(Criterion E1)  
The group of government buildings is uncommon.  Only one other similar formal 
grouping exists in Australia, and that is the Commonwealth and State offices group 
in Brisbane, also designed by John Smith Murdoch. (Criterion B2)  
West Block has associations with the formative days of the National Library, the 
relocation phase of the Federal Capital, the planning and architecture of John Smith 
Murdoch and Walter Burley Griffin, and the evolution of Federal Government 
administration in Canberra. (Criterion H1) 
3.5.2 
Comment  
In addition to the Statement of Significance, the following observations – informed by research and 
analysis undertaken for this HMP – are considered relevant to an appreciation of West Block’s cultural 
heritage significance.

 
The contribution of Charles Weston in establishing the landscape setting for West Block and 
the broader Parliamentary Gardens precinct should be acknowledged (Criterion E, ‘aesthetic 
significance’ and Criterion H ‘associations’).  
 
The physical evolution of West Block should be acknowledged, notably the significant 
iterative changes to the building’s external appearance and massing carried out between 
1937 and 1948.  While the building is demonstrative of key aspects of the Federal Capital 
Architecture, it is not an intact example.  There is also very limited internal evidence of 
original/early (pre-1950s) fabric/attributes.  
 
It would be appropriate to place greater weight on the contribution of West Block to the 
planned landscape of Parliamentary Zone.  That is to say, West Block was planned with its 
own landscape setting, which was connected to a broader landscape setting for the 
Parliamentary Zone through common plantings and circulation networks.

OPPORTUNITIES AND CONSTRAINTS  
The following establishes a framework for the conservation and management policies at Chapter 5.  It 
addresses issues arising from: 
 
The statutory recognition of West Block and the Dugout for heritage reasons;   
 
The application of planning and building regulations and controls;  
 
The aspirations of the lease-holder and building operator;  
 
The interests of stakeholders; 
 
The condition of the building fabric (West Block and Dugout); and 
 
The condition of the landscape setting and its constituent elements. 
The intent is to provide a context for the development of policies (Chapter 5), which address the 
conservation of the place, while equally recognising that the future of West Block depends upon having 
a sustainable and viable future use. 
4.1 
Implications arising from significance 
The Statement of Significance at Chapter 3 confirms that West Block (designed in 1925, built in 1926-27 
and in use from August 1927) is of historical significance to Australia for its association with Federation.  
The building is a component of the Parliament House Secretariat group, the first premises purpose-built 
for Australia’s democratic government.  The principal component of the group is the Provisional 
Parliament House itself, as reflected in its siting on the Land Axis, and its visual prominence within the 
national capital.  West and East blocks were supporting elements.  The primary role of these multi-
purpose buildings was office accommodation.  The buildings within the Parliament House Secretariat 
group were conceived as temporary, pending the construction of a permanent Parliament House, 
completed in 1988.  (CHL criterion A) 
The Dugout (built 1942 and adapted in 1943 and 1945) is of historical significance as the building from 
which Prime Minister Curtin communicated with Australia’s allies during World War II, using a Typex 
cypher machine.  The building is also significant as a remnant of the World War II defences introduced 
within the Parliamentary Zone during World War II.  (CHL criterion A) 
West Block is significant for demonstrating the principal characteristics of the Federal Capital style, an 
interpretation of interwar Stripped Classicism which is now strongly associated with Canberra’s 
establishment phase.  Distinguishing characteristics of the style evident in the building exterior today 
include: horizontal massing; symmetrical façades divided into vertical bays; and a simple, unpretentious 
architectural expression, with limited use of decorative elements.  (CHL criterion D).  Internal evidence 
of the building’s original/early character and layout is very limited and includes: the north-south axis 
that connects the four blocks; the two staircases within B Block; strong rooms in B Block; and a section 
of timber ceiling panelling in B Block, and potentially other sections of ceiling panels that have been 
concealed above dropped ceilings within A, B and C Blocks (all levels).   
The buildings that make up the Parliament House Secretariat group are symmetrically positioned within 
a large-scale landscape (the Parliamentary Triangle, south of King Edward Terrace) that was conceived in 
the 1920s as the centrepiece of the Federal Capital.  The landscape of the Parliamentary Triangle, 
although much altered, is of aesthetic significance (CHL criterion E).  The formality of the planned 
landscape provides an appropriately distinguished setting for the Provisional Parliament House.  It also 
contributed to the establishment of Canberra’s ‘Garden City’ identity.   
The Parliament House Secretariat group is located at the southern end of the Land Axis (Parliament 
House Vista), a key symbolic and planning component of Walter Burley Griffin’s concept for the National 
Capital.  The three buildings were designed by the office of J S Murdoch, Chief Architect of the 
Commonwealth Department of Works and Railways, and were sited to reinforce the formal qualities of

the Land Axis.  The landscape treatment was designed and planted by Thomas Weston, with input from 
Murdoch.  Collectively, the planning and presentation of the Parliament House Secretariat group as a 
key component of Land Axis is a work of creative (technical) significance to Australia (CHL Criterion F).    
West Block is significant for its associations with Walter Burley Griffin, J S Murdoch and Charles Weston, 
each of whom made significant contributions to the planning, design and setting for the building (CHL 
Criterion H).   
Implications arising from this assessment are that key aspects of the place should be conserved to retain 
this significance.  The key features requiring conservation include: 
 
The external presentation of West Block, as a free-standing structure with a general consistency 
of character and details demonstrative of the Federal Capital style 
 
Original/early (pre-1950) internal features and fabric specifically: the north-south axis that 
connects the four blocks on each level; the two staircases in B Block; timber ceiling panels where 
extant in A, B and C Blocks, including a section that is known to survive on the ground floor of B 
Block; and timber structural framing on levels 1 and 2 (see Chapter 2) 
 
Structural landscape elements, including the integral car park between Commonwealth Avenue 
and West Block, the service road between West Block and the car park and the tree-lined vista 
extending north on axis with the north elevation of A Block 
 
Trees and landscape characteristics dating to the 1920s, including trees around the integral car 
park to the west of West Block 
 
The Dugout, to the extent of fabric dating to the 1940s 
 
The broadly symmetrical relationship with East Block located to the east side of the Land Axis  
4.2 
Legislation 
4.2.1 
Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Australia) 
EPBC Act provides a legal framework to protect and manage nationally and internationally important 
flora, fauna, ecological communities and heritage places.105  It is the principal legislation that applies to 
the management of West Block.   
Under the Act, the owner or operator of the site is required to ensure that its Commonwealth Heritage 
values are protected.  An action that will have or is likely to have a significant impact on the 
environment requires approval from the Minister for the Environment and Energy. 
Significant impact is defined as follows: 
A ‘significant impact’ is an impact which is important, notable, or of consequence, 
having regard to its context or intensity.  Whether or not an action is likely to have 
a significant impact depends upon the sensitivity, value, and quality of the 
environment which is impacted, and upon the intensity, duration, magnitude and 
geographic extent of the impacts.  You should consider all of these factors when 
determining whether an action is likely to have a significant impact on matters of 
national environmental significance.106 
An action may be: 
 
a project 
 
a development 
 
an undertaking 


If a proposed action at West Block is likely to have a significant impact on the environment a referral 
must be made under Section 68 of the EPBC Act.  The Minister for the Environment and Energy will then 
decide whether there is a requirement for the action to be approved under the Act (Section 75 of the 
EPBC Act).  
4.2.2 
Commonwealth Heritage List  
West Block and the Dugout at Block 3, Section 23 Parkes (part) is included in the CHL (ID 105428).  The 
citation for this listing is included in Appendix A and reproduced at Chapter 3.  As well as the site-specific 
values attributed to West Block, the citation acknowledges the significance of ‘the location and 
appearance of West Block in relation to East Block, Old Parliament House and [the] Parliamentary 
Triangle and the Land Axis’.108  In this regard, there is alignment between the CHL entry for West Block 
and the Dugout and the CHL entry for the Parliament House Vista (ID 105466).   
West Block forms part of the Parliament House Vista, a large area extending from the Australian War 
Memorial to the new Parliament House (Griffin’s Land Axis), that forms the spine of the national capital 
and has been assessed as a place of historical, aesthetic and social significance to Australia.  As noted in 
the citation for the Vista: 
The spatial setting of the buildings as features in the landscape reflects Beaux Arts 
planning concepts and the building masses and their careful location complement 
the significance of the overall landscape pattern.  Across the Parliamentary 
Triangle, the buildings of Old Parliament House, and East and West Blocks provide a 
distinctive Stripped Classical architectural patterned horizontal band, that 
contributes to the symmetrical overall patterning of the landscape.109 
The HMP for the Parliament House Vista includes policies of relevance to West Block including, but not 
limited to, the following: 
New Development  
Policy 49 General provisions relating to new development  
The following general provisions will be implemented: 
 
new permanent development will not impact on the heritage values of the 
area nor on important spatial relationships between individual buildings and 
open spaces (eg. the relationship between the High Court and National Gallery, 
or between the Gallery and Sculpture Garden); 
 
new permanent development in the area will be part of a planned approach 
which is in keeping with the values of the area.  Ad hoc development will be 
avoided … 110 
4.2.3 
Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act, 1988 (Commonwealth) 
The Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 establishes the National 
Capital Authority (NCA) and requires the NCA to establish and administer a National Capital Plan (NCP).  
The NCP, first gazetted in 1990, identifies and defines Designated Areas.  These are areas of the ACT that 
have been identified as having the special characteristics of the National Capital.  Policies for land use 
and conditions of planning, design and development within Designated Areas are set out in the NCP.  
Approval from the NCA is required for all works proposed within a Designated Area.   
National Capital Plan 
The Parliamentary Zone is a Designated Area as identified in the NCP (Figure 44).  The following is an 
extract from Section 4.2.1 ‘The Parliamentary Zone and its Setting’ of the NCP:

The National Capital and Seat of Government is the legislative, judicial, 
administrative, executive, ceremonial and symbolic centre of the nation.  
The role of Canberra as the National Capital warrants high environmental and 
aesthetic standards for development generally.  It also requires that national 
functions are located where they may operate effectively and efficiently.  
Areas that clearly exhibit the special characteristics of the National Capital primarily 
have the Parliamentary Zone and its setting as their focus.  They embrace the main 
National Capital uses and national institutions, and other centrally located areas of 
National Land, diplomatic areas, and nearby lands where planning, design and 
development are critical.   
The core of those areas is the Parliamentary Zone – the physical manifestation of 
Australian democratic government and the home of the nation’s most important 
cultural and judicial institutions and symbols.  
The area ensures that the essential relationships between Parliament and its 
setting are planned, developed and conserved in an integrated way, with the 
Commonwealth providing the requisite leadership of design and ensuring that 
construction and maintenance operations are carried out to the highest 
standards.111 
Conditions of planning, design and development in the Parliamentary Zone of particular relevance to the 
proposed adaptation of West Block as a hotel are set out in the NCP (Section 4.1.2) and summarised at 
Table 6.

Conditions of planning, design and development (NCP Section 4.1.2) 
Land use  
Land uses will comprise: 
Parliamentary Uses and National Capital Uses, including national legislative, 
judicial and executive functions, and Commonwealth cultural institutions 
 
such other uses, including a limited range of commercial uses and tourism 
facilities that complement and enhance the function and character of the 
area. 
 
Special consideration will be given to community, cultural, residential, tourism, 
entertainment and leisure uses which complement and enhance the function 
and character of the Designated Area. 
Urban design  
The urban design of the area is to achieve an integrated design of the highest 
quality by managing building height and bulk, and by encouraging building 
forms and layouts on consistent building alignments which enhance the 
structure of the Griffins’ plans. 
Development  
Development must be guided by the principles, policies and Indicative 
Development Plan for the Parliamentary Zone set out in the Parliamentary 
Zone Precinct Code [see discussion below, Parliamentary Zone Precinct Code]. 
 
New development should seek to respect the design and character of adjacent 
buildings in terms of scale, colour, materials, massing and frontage alignment. 
 
Individual development proposals will be assessed on their merits in respect to 
sunlight penetration, amenity, pedestrian and vehicle access. No buildings 
taller than RL617 will be permitted in the Designated Area, but the general 
building height will be 3-4 storeys except where the National Capital Authority 
determines otherwise. 
 
Buildings in the area must show an appropriate quality of architectural design 
consistent with their location in this area of special national importance 
Landscape  
Landscaping is to enhance the visual setting of the Designated Area and 
integrate the buildings with their landscape setting.  This will be carried out in 
accordance with a landscape masterplan to be prepared by the National 
Capital Authority which particularly emphasises the following landscape 
themes:  
a. the formal and consistent landscaping of Main Avenues and mall spaces  
b. the combination of formal and informal landscaping which occurs 
around the Lake’s edge and is the setting for Parliament House and its 
adjacent area. 
[Note: During research for this HMP a landscape masterplan for the 
Parliamentary Zone prepared by the NCA was not located.]

Parliamentary Zone Precinct Code 
With regards to the Parliamentary Zone, core ambitions of the NCP are to give the area, ‘meaning as the 
place of the people, accessible to all Australians so that they can more fully understand and appreciate 
the collective experience and rich diversity of this country’.112  Development and planning within the 
Parliamentary Zone will be guided by: 
 
Balancing politics and culture 
 
Welcoming people 
 
Celebrating Australian history and society 
 
Representing Australian excellence 
 
Emphasising the importance of the public realm 
 
Making access easy and open 
 
Reinforcing the integrity of the visual structure 
 
Strengthening the relationship between buildings and the landscape 
 
Creating a variety of urban spaces 
 
Establishing comprehensive design management policies for the future.113 
The NCP promotes the identification of campuses (or precincts) within the Parliamentary Zone.  The 
intent is for existing buildings to act as ‘anchors’ for new development that serves a ‘compatible 
function’.114  Landscaped courts, or campus squares, are proposed to provide a focus for each campus.  
The NCP identifies five campuses.  West Block is located within the ‘Parliamentary Executive Campus’, 
Campus A (Figure 45 and Figure 46) – the anticipated functions of the Parliamentary Executive Campus 
are not expanded upon in the NCP.  Within this area, large new building masses equidistant from the 
Land Axis are proposed to the east of West Block and the west of East Block.  As is the case for East and 
West blocks, the footprints of the new buildings are not identical.  A landscaped court, located on the 
Land Axis, connects the two new building forms.   
The Precinct Code for the Parliamentary Zone also places emphasis on the delivery of tree planting 
within the area, to enhance an appreciation and understanding of Canberra’s ‘enduring design concept’ 
and the character and structure of the city.115 
4.2.4 
Parliament Act, 1974 (Commonwealth) 
All works proposed within the Parliamentary Zone require the approval of both Houses of Federal 
Parliament.  Development proposals may be either reported or referred to the Joint Standing 
Committee on the National Capital and External Territories.  The Committee is appointed to inquire into 
and report on:  
… matters coming within the terms of section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974 [see 
discussion below] as may be referred to it by: 
(i) either House of the Parliament; or 
(ii) the Minister responsible for administering the Parliament Act 1974, or

Maintenance and/or minor works are typically reported to the Committee.  Where proposals are of a 
greater order of magnitude, either House of the Parliament or a Minister may make a referral to the 
Committee.  In these situations, the Committee may make recommendations for approval.  
Section 5 of the Parliament Act 1974 is as follows:  
1. No building or other work is to be erected on land within the Parliamentary Zone unless the 
Minister has caused a proposal for the control of erection of the building or work to be laid 
before each House of the Parliamentary. 
2. Sub-section (1) does not prevent the carrying out of work by way of maintenance or repair of 
buildings or works situated on land within the Parliamentary zone, or byway of internal 
alterations to those buildings or works.  
3. Sub-section (1) does not apply to buildings and works which have reached the documentation 
stage by 1 December 1974.117 
4.2.5 
Utilities Act 2000 (ACT) 
The provisions of the Utilities Act 2000 (ACT) apply to the substation at West Block.  The substation is 
accommodated in the Dugout, a former air raid shelter that is included in the CHL (ID 105428).   
The Act requires that ActewAGL personnel have unimpeded and unrestricted access to the building 
without notice at all times.  The principal point of access to the substation is at the south end of the 
building, west elevation.   
Consistent with ActewAGL’s protocols, there must be no built form within five metres of a freestanding 
substation chamber, as is the case at West Block.  Further, the existing easement to the Dugout must be 
maintained, with no structure or fence built over it.   
4.2.6 
National Construction Code (BCA) compliance  
The intent of the National Construction Code (BCA) is to achieve national standards in the areas of 
safety, health and amenity.  Compliance with the NCC is required for all new works and works to an 
existing building. 
The NCC addresses all building compliance requirements as related to specified classes of buildings.  In 
its formulation and reference to relevant construction standards, the Code has been developed for new 
construction.  In this regard application wholesale to the refurbishment or redevelopment of a heritage 
building has the potential to have significant impacts, particularly if a ‘full compliance’ with the code is 
triggered.  
In cases of existing buildings undergoing alterations and/or additions, some discretion may be available 
with regard to upgrading the existing part of the building to meet the NCC.  
4.2.7 
Disability Discrimination Act, 1992 
On 1 May 2011, the Disability (Access to Premises – Buildings) Standards (Premises Standards) took 
effect under the Disability Discrimination Act 1992.  These standards align with the relevant provisions 
of the NCC. 
Access for people with a disability as relevant to future works to West Block are addressed under the 
Disability Discrimination Act (DDA), 1992, and also under the NCC and the Australian Human Rights 
Commission ‘Premises Standards’.  While the DDA sets out compliance requirements it is a document 
which also provisions for complaints where these requirements are not met.  In the case of the NCC, the 
requirements under Part D3 are express requirements which must be met under the Deemed to Satisfy 
provisions or by way of a Performance Solution.  Additionally, the Premises Standards provide guidance 
on both new works and works to existing buildings to meet access requirements.

Having regard to these documents, bringing heritage buildings into compliance typically requires a 
carefully resolved design response which frequently requires a balancing of access and heritage 
outcomes.  Given the absolute need to provide equitable access design solutions to upgrading and reuse 
need to be developed in a manner which optimises access points and paths of travel to avoid multiple 
interventions. 
A key issue at West Block is the management of the level change at the main west entry to the building.   
4.3 
Crown Lease 
NG Landholdings Hotel Pty Ltd (Nick Georgalis, sole director) signed a 99-year Crown Lease for West 
Block on 20 November 2017.  The new owner has an interest in adapting the redundant office building 
as a hotel.   
Matters in the lease with implications for the management of the building from a heritage perspective 
include the following.   
 
Clause 3(c): The lessee must not take an action that will have an adverse impact on the 
Commonwealth Heritage Values without prior written consent of DoEE.  
 
Clause 3(d).  In the event that West Block is removed from the Commonwealth Heritage List the 
lessee must nominate the place for inclusion in the ACT Heritage Register.  
 
Clause 3 (e): The lessee must prepare an HMP to protect and conserve the Commonwealth 
Heritage values of the place.  This should be lodged with the DoEE for review and approval 
within 12 months of first signing the lease (by 16 November 2018) and updated at least once 
every five years.   
 
Clause 3 (e): The lessee is responsible for reviewing and updating the HMP in accordance with 
the EPBC Act.   
 
Clause 3 (e) The lessee is required to conserve and manage the place in a proper, safe and sound 
standard of repair and condition in accordance with the HMP and Commonwealth Heritage 
values  
 
Clause 3 (h) The lessee must not display any advertising sign or hoarding without the written 
consent of the NCA 
 
Clause 3 (i) The lessee must screen and keep screened all service areas to the satisfaction of the 
NCA and shall ensure that all plant machinery be contained within the premises is suitably 
screened from public view.  
 
Clause 3 (j) The lessee is required to seek prior approval from the NCA to erect any building on 
the land or make any external structural alterations.   
 
While not explicitly a heritage consideration, it is noted that Clause 3(b) of the Crown Lease requires 
that the aggregate total Gross Floor Area of any building or buildings on the land must not exceed 
10,034 [square] metres.   
4.4 
Stakeholders 
At a general level, stakeholders as related to West Block fall into two categories: statutory and/or

committed to promoting an understanding and appreciation Canberra as the National Capital.   
4.4.3 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people 
Consultation with Representative Aboriginal Organisations (RAO) was undertaken on site at West Block 
in December 2013 (see Section 1.7).  At that time, the consensus of attendees at the site walk and 
meeting considered that, ‘there were no concerns regarding Aboriginal cultural heritage for the area.’118   
It was, however, agreed that the use of the area occupied by West Block as a pathway between Black 
Mountain and Mount Kurrajong (New Parliament House) should be acknowledged.  This issue is 
addressed at Policy 23 ‘Interpretation’ in Chapter 5. 
4.4.4 
Associations and special interest groups  
A number of professional associations/groups have an interest in West Block, both in its own right and 
as part of the Parliament House Secretariat group.  These include associations/groups whose principal 
areas of interest relate to heritage, landscape design or architecture, consistent with the heritage 
significance of West Block and its setting.   
It can be anticipated that the WBGS would be concerned with issues related to the legibility of the 
Griffin Plan for Canberra associated with any proposal for change or works at West Block; the NT and 
AIA are likely to have a particular interest in the formal architectural qualities and characteristics of 
West Block itself; while AILA will have regard for the management of the landscape setting.  
In 2018, the Winston Churchill Memorial Trust (England) presented a sculpture of Winston Churchill to 
Geocon on permanent loan, in commemoration of Prime Minister Churchill’s coded correspondence 
with Prime Minister Curtin during World War II from the Dugout.119  The Foundation will have an 
interest in works with the potential to affect an understanding of the association between West Block 
and Winston Churchill.  
4.4.5 
General public 
West Block is a long-standing feature of the Parliamentary Triangle landscape.  Since the removal of the 
1920s plantings to Commonwealth Avenue in the 1980s, it has also been a particularly prominent 
feature in its location at a major point of entry to the Parliamentary Zone.

As reflected in the public debate about the Government’s decision to sell West Block, as well as other 
assets within the Parliamentary Triangle (see Chapter 2), it can be anticipated that there will be a high 
degree of public interest in proposals for change, new works and adaptive re-use of West Block.  
4.5 
Condition and presentation of built fabric  
The external presentation of West Block has not changed significantly since the extensions to A Block in 
1948.  The various alterations and additions carried out between 1937 and 1948 were generally 
reverential to the original design intent and architectural language, and despite its much-changed 
massing, the building still reads as a coherent example of early Federal Capital style design.  Major 
interventions since the mid-twentieth century have generally been internal, including the works 
completed in the early 1980s.   
The building is in sound condition externally, and there are no known impediments to the on-going use 
of the building or its adaptation as a consequence of structural integrity.  One issue of note is structural 
cracking to D Block, which may be related to the construction of the slip road to State Circle in the 
1980s.   
An Intrusive Hazardous Material Survey and Management Plan (IHSMP) for West Block was completed 
by Robson Environment in July 2014.  Bonded Asbestos, lead paint, synthetic mineral fibre and Ozone 
Depleting Substances were all detected during the inspection of the building.  The IHSMP made a 
number of recommendations including: removal of hazardous materials; management of hazardous 
materials in situ; monitoring and further inspection.  These recommendations should be observed, 
subject to the recommendations of Policy 13 ‘Hazardous materials’.    
4.6 
Condition and presentation of setting  
At West Block, a landscape was delivered with the construction of the building which was both 
responsive to the function and presentation of the office site, and integrated into the formal systems of 
the broader Parliamentary Triangle landscape.  The strategy deployed by Charles Weston leaned heavily 
on dense tree plantings deployed on formal lines to achieve an immediate visual and environmental 
impact, with some expectation that these initial plantings would be thinned over time through attrition 
and active management.  
Within that formal structure, the original plantings were highly diverse, including a variety of exotic 
deciduous and coniferous trees which, when used in alternation and opposition, contributed a rhythm 
and texture to the large-scale urban reforesting effort that was being undertaken.  The species diversity 
also responded to the experimental nature of the project that was being undertaken, testing the 
suitability of a variety of available exotic trees to the local climate and ground conditions at Canberra.  
Some failure and redundancy within the plant selections and the planting organisation was anticipated.  
Partly as a consequence of those design decisions, the original planting treatment at West Block, while 
altered and reduced, remains discernible.  While throughout the site there is a need for regeneration 
and repair, aspects of the formal planting system remain, including some of the formal arrangements of 
trees defining vistas and intersections, and the rows of mixed specimen trees defining boundaries and 
edges.  Where trees have been replaced and new plantings added, these have generally been selected 
sympathetically and located within the structural parameters set in the original planting.  The 
introduction of new native plantings to the east of West Block in the 1980s is also consistent with 
Weston’s 1920s vision for Camp Hill.   
There are 81 trees within Block 3, Section 23 Parkes (part).  As assessed in June 2018, a number of the 
trees which constitute the formal landscape of Zone 1 are in poor health and demonstrate symptoms of 
stress and decline.120  This is not unexpected for exotic trees approaching 80-100 years of age in an 
urban environment and subject to the climate conditions and variations prevalent in Canberra.  Trees

around the integral car park at the west of Block 3, Section 23 Parkes (part) have also been identified as 
exhibiting issues consistent with the consequences of soil compaction.121  
This is an aging landscape which, despite previous modifications and the loss of a substantial fraction of 
its original tree plantings, retains much of its original planted structure and intended character.  The 
West Block plantings also remain important to the continuity of the formal landscape of the 
Parliamentary Triangle.

and attributes 
 
The retention and conservation of significant elements and attributes in accordance with the 
policies and recommendations in this HMP; and  
 
A sensitive and respectful approach to adaptation, new works and future development where 
significant fabric and elements may be affected. 
If alterations or changes are proposed which support an appropriate and viable use for the building 
(including its operation as a hotel), the works should be undertaken in a manner which has minimal 
impact on significant fabric and attributes.  
Policy 2 
Adoption of the Burra Charter 
The conservation and management of West Block should be carried out in accordance with the principles 
of the Burra Charter (2013).  
When assessing the suitability of proposed works to significant elements and attributes at West Block, 
the principles of the Burra Charter and its practice notes should be referenced.  These principles provide 
guidance on the conservation and adaptation of places and elements identified as being of cultural 
heritage significance. 
Policy 3 
Adoption of policies 
The policies included in this HMP should be endorsed and adopted by the present and future owners, or 
managers, of West Block and should form the primary guide for its management. 
This HMP should inform on-going management and future development of West Block.  The present and 
future owners of the site should adopt and implement the policies of the HMP as the key guiding 
reference in terms of managing change and future development within the site.   
Policy 4 
Specialist advice and skills 
Advice from qualified heritage practitioners should be sought before any action is proposed or 
undertaken that could have an impact on the Commonwealth Heritage values of West Block.  
Where works to significant elements or attributes are proposed, or where technical advice is needed, it 
is important to select consultants and contractors with proven experience in the relevant field.  This 
applies to the development of strategic approaches to undertaking works, as well as to the delivery of

Policy 5 
Compliance with legislation 
Geocon should develop and implement protocols for compliance with all applicable legislation, including 
the EPBC Act.  
The development of protocols to ensure compliance with all applicable legislation should include 
triggers to ensure compliance with the EPBC Act, being the key piece of legislation that applies directly 
to management of West Block’s heritage values.   
In the event that actions with the potential to have a significant impact on the Commonwealth Heritage 
values of West Block are contemplated, Geocon should consult with the Minister for the Environment.  
Policy 6 
Stakeholder liaison 
Geocon should consult with all stakeholders identified at Chapter 4 (Section 4.4) and other 
parties/individuals as relevant, on matters affecting the heritage values of West Block. 
Individuals and organisations (stakeholders) with a particular interest in West Block and the Dugout 
should be advised of any proposals with the potential to impact on the identified values of the place and 
provided with opportunities to comment.  This may be conducted via public advertising (general public) 
or direct contact.  
Policy 7 
Managing sensitive information 
In the event that sensitive information relating to West Block comes to light, Geocon should ensure that 
it has protocols in place to manage that information appropriately.  
As required by the EPBC Act Regulations, 2000, Schedule 7a (h) (v), Geocon should ensure that it has 
protocols in place to manage information of a sensitive relating to the heritage place appropriately.  
Policy 8 
Review of the HMP 
Consistent with best practice, and the requirements of the EPBC Act, this HMP should be reviewed and 
updated every five years (by 2023). 
Relevant considerations in undertaking a review of this HMP are to incorporate any new information 
that comes to light, particularly where there is the potential for the new information to result in a 
reassessment of values.  Major physical change to the place would be a trigger for a review of this HMP.  
Other triggers include instances where: major change occurs as a result of an accident or misadventure 
(i.e. vandalism or fire); or the HMP is found to be out of date with regard to significance.

The service road between West Block and its integral car park (as truncated in the 1980s) 
> 
The axial walkway extending the northern formal axis from across Queen Victoria Terrace to 
the north face of West Block. 
Trees dating to the 1920s (Figure 47), specifically:  
> 
Lombardy poplar (Populus nigra ‘Italica’) to the north of West Block, associated with the 
axial walkway and a paired poplar planting on the other side of Queen Victoria Terrace 
> 
Arizona cypresses (Cupressus Arizonica) (x4) to the north of West Block, two either side of

Possible specimens of American elm (Ulmus Americana) (up to x6) around the integral car 
park 
 
Landscape features and characteristics as established in the 1920s, specifically: 
> 
Formal termination of the northern axial walkway at the north face of West Block, by way of 
a pair of Lombardy Poplars (one survives) located within a surrounding setting of four 
Arizona cypress specimens. 
> 
A mixed plantation of exotic specimens to the north and west of West Block, including 
around the car park (‘Zone 1’ at Figure 47) and service road, including multiple bands of 
structural planting as defined in the 1928 planting plan.  Each band of trees was selected 
and grouped to provide formal structure, amenity shade and visual screening responsive to 
their respective position relative to the surrounding road network and parliamentary 
buildings.  
> 
The presence of an informal sector of native landscape to the east and south-east of West 
Block, referencing the interwar landscape treatment of Camp Hill (‘Zone 2’ at Figure 47).  
The existing specimens are generally recently planted, and there are no specimens of 
individual significance.   
Implementation of this policy will require recognition of and respect for the attributes and elements 
identified above on the part of building occupants and managers, and adherence to Policy 4, which

recommends engaging the services of professional heritage consultants in planning and designing 
outcomes that are compatible with West Block’s heritage values.  Consistent with the Burra Charter, 
conservation means all the processes of looking after a place so as to retain its cultural significance, and 
may include maintenance, preservation and restoration.

Policy 10 
Heritage curtilage 
The heritage curtilage for West Block should be defined as Block 3, Section 23 Parkes (part). 
The ‘heritage curtilage’ for a building, complex or site has been defined as, ‘the area of land (including 
land covered by water) surrounding an item or area of heritage significance which is essential for 
retaining and interpreting its heritage significance’.122  A heritage curtilage should include all significant 
elements and establish an area which is managed to ensure the maintenance of heritage significance.  
Identification of land to be included within a heritage curtilage does not preclude change within this 
area.  Land within a heritage curtilage does, however, need to be managed so as not to adversely impact 
on setting, presentation or significance of a heritage place. 
West Block was planned with its own landscape setting, which was connected to a broader landscape 
setting for the Parliamentary Zone through common plantings and circulation networks, including the 
tree-lined vista on axis with West Block’s north elevation and the lozenge-shaped form of Magna Carta 
Place.  These structural elements are balanced on the east side of the Parliamentary and form part of 
the setting for East Block.   
The heritage curtilage for West Block should extend beyond the boundaries of Block 3, Section 23 Parkes 
(part) to include elements that connect West Block to the broader planned landscape.

Policy 11 
Views and visual relationships 
Views and visual relationships that support an understanding of the site’s historical and aesthetic 
significance should be maintained.  
West Block is a component of the Parliament House Secretariat group that is sited within the 
Parliamentary Triangle.  The area is characterised by generously-spaced buildings within a formal 
landscape setting.  Buildings are not the dominant features of this significant cultural landscape.   
West Block shares a planning relationship with East Block; both are equidistant from the Land Axis.  The 
distance between the two buildings, and the topography of the area in between (Camp Hill) is such that 
there is little or no visual relationship between the two buildings as experienced on the ground.  There 
is, however, a line of sight between West Block and the rear of Old Parliament House, which should be 
maintained, at least in part.  
As existing, key views of West Block are from Commonwealth Avenue, to the west.  This is a relatively 
recent condition: the dense wind-row plantings to the Avenue introduced by Charles Weston in the 
1920s were removed in the 1980s.  West Block’s west elevation, visible from Commonwealth Avenue, is 
the building’s principal façade.  While West Block was designed to be seen in the round, and has the 
same architectural presentation to all sides, the west elevation has always been its principal address.  
The view to West Block from the north, as established and framed by an axial walkway and avenue 
planting through the Parliamentary Gardens, also remains a key formal view to the building.  Visual 
continuity to the north elevation of West Block should be maintained from the axial walkway north of 
Queen Victoria Terrace. 
Policy 12 
Cyclical maintenance and remedial works to significant built fabric  
Programs of priority maintenance, remedial works and cyclical maintenance should form the basis for 
on-going care of the significant built fabric at West Block, including the Dugout.  
The fabric of historic buildings and fabric will deteriorate over time due to the effects of age, weather 
and use.  Poor maintenance can hasten the decline and decay of fabric, which can be expensive to 
rectify if not promptly addressed.  It may also result in the loss of significant heritage fabric which can in 
turn impact on the heritage values of the place. 
The establishment of a cyclical maintenance programme will help to retard deterioration and, following 
any refurbishment works, to prevent future deterioration of restored original or introduced new 
material.  Broadly, the approach to maintenance should firstly be to maintain and ensure that the 
significant original and early fabric does not deteriorate further and secondly to maintain all existing 
fabric.  Ad hoc repairs or patch ups should be avoided. 
Regular inspections of the building’s fabric should occur, with an emphasis on susceptible areas such as 
guttering and downpipes, door and window openings.  Generally, day-to-day maintenance work can be 
carried out in accordance with the conservation policies and without reference to a conservation 
specialist.  However, major maintenance works should be undertaken under the direction of an 
appropriately qualified conservation practitioner.  
The primary aim of repair work should be to retain as much of the historic material as possible.  In most 
cases involving repairs to significant fabric, the advice of a heritage practitioner will be required prior to 
undertaking the works, to ensure the significant fabric is treated appropriately.

Maintenance 
Maintenance addresses all existing components of the place, including fabric and setting.  Introducing 
new elements (such as new structures) or changing and adapting the existing building are not matters of 
maintenance, and are addressed in policies and recommendations included elsewhere in this HMP.   
Typical maintenance works at West Block and the Dugout include: 
 
Cleaning out drainage systems and other water storage and drainage areas 
 
Maintaining and securing external wall fabric, glazing and joinery in an appropriate and 
sympathetic manner (may require specialist input) 
 
Maintaining building equipment and services  
 
Replacing or upgrading services (may require specialist input for substantial works) 
 
Maintaining existing power or pipelines or other services where this involves no alteration to the 
fabric of the place 
Regular monitoring of the condition of significant fabric is an important aspect of maintenance.  It will 
also assist in satisfying Schedule 7a (h)(ix) of the EPBC Act Regulations, which requires monitoring of the 
West Block’s Commonwealth Heritage values.  As summarised at Section 3.6, Table 5 of this report, 
building fabric is a critical attribute of the majority of the site’s CHL values, including: 
 
External fabric dating to the period 1926-48  
 
Early/original internal features and fabric specifically: the north-south axis that connects the 
four blocks on each level; the two staircases in B Block; timber ceiling panels where extant in A, 
B and C Blocks; and timber structural framing on levels 1 and 2 
 
The planned relationship between West Block and the other components of the Parliament 
House Secretariat group (East Block and the Provisional Parliament House) 
 
All of the original form and fabric of the Dugout 
The condition of these physical elements should be monitored and recorded as part of the on-going 
maintenance regime for West Block and the Dugout.  See also Policy 14 ‘Landscape maintenance’ and 
Policy 21 ‘Recording’.   
With regard to the recommended cyclical inspection and maintenance programme, the following sets 
out a desirable minimum program for cyclical maintenance. 
Annual:  
Roof cladding, gutters, downpipes, drains and surface drainage, bird-proofing, 
roof space, security and fire precautions, plumbing, electrical and data cables 
and appliances, windows and doors and general safety.  Ceilings, floors, stairs, 
joinery, fixtures and fittings, tiling and building services. 
4–5 years:  
External walls, external joinery other than for windows and doors and lighting. 
Repairs 
From a heritage perspective it is generally recommended that repairs of significant buildings and 
structures should involve replacing ‘like with like,’ i.e. the replacement of material (missing, deteriorated 
or broken) with fabric to match the existing.  Accepting this principle, it is also important to determine if 
the material proposed for replacement is appropriate (it may not be original).  The advice of a qualified 
heritage practitioner should be sought on this.  Wherever possible, only actual decayed fabric of a 
heritage structure should be replaced, instead of the whole host element.   
Repairs to significant structures should also, in preference, be carried out by appropriately skilled staff 
or contractors, and may require in some cases prior analysis of the composition of the fabric to be 
repaired/replaced.

Specialist input may also be required for the identification and eradication of any damage caused by 
pest infestations.  Rectification may involve repair to, or replacement of, damaged fabric.  
Policy 13 
Hazardous materials  
Removal of hazardous materials from West Block should seek to minimise physical impacts on significant 
values and attributes. 
Where hazardous materials are removed, the key consideration from a heritage perspective will be to 
conduct their removal with minimal physical impacts on the presentation and character of West Block.  
This includes recording evidence of early decorative treatments where there is a requirement to remove 
paint.  
Policy 14 
Landscape maintenance  
Original and early tree plantings, and evidence of landscape character areas, should be retained and 
enhanced.  
Plantings dating to the 1920s should be conserved using appropriate arboricultural methods, to prolong 
their viability and contribution to the visual legibility and amenity of the landscape integral to West 
Block.  Arboricultural assessment and maintenance should be undertaken by a qualified arborist with 
documented experience in assessing and maintaining heritage-significant exotic trees.  
While arboricultural works should be undertaken in general conformance with the appropriate 
Australian Standard, pruning of heritage significant trees is to be conservative in ambition except where 
required for the protection of public safety or to address other emergency conditions.  Excessive 
thinning and weight reduction is to be avoided, and these types of actions are only to be undertaken 
with respect to heritage significant trees based on sound arboricultural advice and planning. 
However, pruning of new and replacement trees should be undertaken during establishment and as 
required thereafter to optimise structural form and aesthetic quality and to correctly integrate new 
trees into the established canopy.  
Aging trees frequently enter a period of deterioration (known as senescence) prior to death, during 
which structural issues with the tree may multiply to the extent that the tree becomes hazardous to an 
extent that cannot be mitigated by arboricultural works.  Where retention of a given tree is assessed as 
no longer feasible, the tree should be removed in its entirety and appropriate replacement trees should 
be established within the existing structure of the planting scheme.  As far as possible, trees should be 
replaced with the same species and in comparable position, with reference to both existing conditions 
and the 1928 planting plan.  Where variation is required, it should be sympathetic to the original 
planting intent.  
A mixed plantation of exotic tree specimens, generally comprised of group plantings in linear rows and 
perimetric rings, should be maintained to the north and west of West Block, defining the borders and 
formal landscape arrangements of the place.  Rows and groupings should be arranged using 
monocultural or alternating species plantings, as appropriate to the intention and established in the 
1928 plan of permanent plantings.   
The plantation should continue to be comprised of species nominated in the 1928 plan, except where 
these species are not feasibly employed for reasons of commercial availability, climate suitability or 
because they are now considered noxious or environmental weeds in the ACT. All new and replacement 
plantings should be managed as appropriate to ensure successful establishment.  Where it is not 
feasible for the above reasons to replace an existing tree with the original species when required (i.e. 
Giant Redwood), an alternate species should be selected which is sympathetic to the original form and

design intent of the 1928 planting and responsive to current conditions.  
Native plantings should be maintained to the east and south-east of West Block, consistent with the 
original treatment of Camp Hill.  As noted at Policy 9, the existing native trees to the south-east of West 
Block are not of individual significance and can be contemplated for removal if required.  A key 
consideration will be to maintain the informal native character of the area, which dates to the interwar 
period.   
Car park management and tree conservation 
Changes should be undertaken to the layout, physical kerbing and/or functional arrangement of the 
integral car park in order to end the practice of parking on grass areas, and to remediate existing soil 
compaction.  Remediation of soil compaction is to be undertaken under the direction of qualified 
arborists and soil scientists, and in a manner which conserves existing trees. 
At such time as substantial tree replacement works are required, it would be appropriate to implement 
additional measures to remediate and improve the condition of the existing soil, reduce compaction 
impacts and provide additional rooting volume for surrounding trees.  
Further landscape changes to the car park should maintain a surrounding ring of structural and amenity 
tree plantings consistent with the original and extant character of this landscape, and conserve existing 
trees to the extent feasible. Improvements to the functional design of the west car park should in all 
cases be balanced with the conservation of the significant landscape features, including original trees 
where present. 
Shrub and groundcover plantings 
Shrub plantings, hedges and groundcovers should be laid out and specified so that these plantings 
support and are subservient to the structural tree plantings as originally conceived. Plant selection and 
bed layouts for groundcover and shrub/hedge layers should be sympathetic to the exotic tree palette 
employed throughout Zone 1.  
Plantings in areas immediately proximate to the building should complement and reinforce the aesthetic 
values of the architecture. These plantings should generally be designed to be sympathetic to the exotic 
palette established within Zone 1, except where planting beds are directly proximate to the informal 
native landscape in Zone 2 and should be complementary to the existing character of that area. 
Where the opportunity arises to reduce or remove the existing (non-original) perimeter hedges 
surrounding the car park and the northern elevation of West Block, this action is encouraged.  
All staff and contractors who are engaged in the maintenance of West Block’s planted and structural 
landscape should be inducted as to the heritage values of the place and relevant conservation and 
management policies (see also Policy 23). 
Monitoring 
Regular monitoring of the condition of West Block’s landscape setting, both in its own right and as part 
of the Parliamentary Triangle setting, is required in order to satisfy Schedule 7a (h)(ix) of the EPBC Act 
Regulations.  As noted at Section 3.6, Table 5 of this report, the landscape setting and landscape context 
are intrinsic to West Block’s ability to satisfy CHL criterion ‘F’.  The condition of these landscape 
elements/attributes should be monitored and recorded as part of the on-going maintenance regime for 
West Block.  See also Policy 12 ‘Cyclical maintenance and remedial works to significant built fabric’ and 
Policy 21 ‘Recording’.

Use, adaptation and change  
Policy 15 
Use 
Future uses of West Block should be compatible with the assessed values of the place so that its cultural 
significance is maintained and conserved. 
West Block was designed for office use, to support a variety of Parliamentary and bureaucratic 
functions.  These functions varied over time and are not overtly expressed in the physical fabric, which 
was consciously neutral, or ‘official’ to use J S Murdoch’s term.  
Continued use of West Block as an office would be compatible with the building’s historic values.  It is, 
however, acknowledged that the building does not meet contemporary needs or expectations as office 
space, and that this is not a realistic prospect.  The building’s location within the Parliamentary Zone, 
and close to the diplomatic precinct makes a commercial use more likely.  This is consistent with the 
NCP, which supports ‘a limited range of commercial uses and tourism facilities [within the Parliamentary 
Zone] that complement and enhance the function and character of the area’.   
A key consideration in an adaptive re-use will be to ensure that the assessed values of West Block are 
maintained.  These values are both tangible (built fabric and landscape setting) and intangible (historical 
significance).  The values that relate to tangible elements can be maintained through conservation 
works and on-going management.  The historical values can be maintained through conservation of the 
original/early building fabric and landscape elements, supplemented by on-site interpretation (Policy 
23).   
Policy 16 
Contextual presentation 
The contribution of West Block as a prominent and distinctive anchor at a key point of entry to the 
Parliamentary Zone should be retained and enhanced. 
In anticipation of significant change to West Block and its setting as a result of adaptation to a new use, 
emphasis should be placed on reinforcing the visual prominence and landscaped setting of the historic 
building in views to the Parliamentary Zone and within it.  This is important for the continued 
interpretation and appreciation of the site. 
See also Policy 11 ‘Views and visual relationships’ and Policy 19 ‘Reestablishment of original landscape 
character and features’.   
Policy 17 
Changes to buildings and fabric 
Physical alterations to significant fabric should be limited to works that do not diminish the cultural 
heritage values of West Block and the Dugout.  
West Block has long history of adaptation and alteration in response to the requirements of its varied 
occupants.  The first significant alterations occurred within a decade of the building’s completion, and 
the most recent major works were completed in the early 1980s.  Further physical and functional 
change at the building is anticipated.  From a heritage perspective this can reasonably be contemplated, 
providing that the works do not diminish the cultural heritage significance of the place overall. 
The Dugout is a physically unprepossessing structure that has been modified, extended and repurposed 
on two occasions since its construction in 1942.  Alterations to the building to reveal its original form 
should be encouraged, supported by in-situ interpretation to communicate the nature of the building’s 
historical significance.

General principles 
The future use of West Block is likely to require physical change in the form of alterations, internal 
demolition and new works (note, new development is addressed at Policy 18).  Where this occurs, the 
overriding objectives are firstly to retain and conserve significant fabric, and secondly to plan and 
undertake works in a manner that is sensitive to the valued form and presentation of significant fabric 
and elements.  All alternative approaches should be investigated before significant fabric and elements 
are removed   
The extent of change at West Block since 1927 is such that reconstruction to an earlier or original form 
would be neither viable nor appropriate – the building’s evolved form should be understood as part of 
its historical significance.  There is, however, potential for that process of evolution to continue, subject 
to the recommendations of this HMP.  Where actions are proposed that reveal or uncover original or 
early features of the building, these actions can be contemplated in the context of this evolutionary 
process.  Any reinstatement works should be delivered accurately, based on the comprehensive 
documentary record for the site.   
General principles are that the building’s external form and fabric should be retained; there is very 
limited potential for permanent additions physically attached to the building.  There is greater potential 
for change to the interior, which has been the subject of multiple configurations over time (internal 
subdivision) and includes limited evidence of original/early details and finishes.  More detailed guidance 
on future change at West Block is included at Table 7, exterior and Table 8, interior.  Guidance on future 
change at the Dugout is at Table 9.

Building envelope 
 The building envelope should be retained, including the roof form, to 
maintain an understanding of the building’s original form and scale.  This 
includes the 1926-27 fabric to the light courts at B Block, which were 
originally external walls.  
 Rooftop additions should not be contemplated.   
 The building’s existing presentation should be maintained.  There is no 
potential for over painting face brickwork or removing render, and the 
introduction of applied details should be avoided.   
 Opportunities to return modified openings to their original form should be 
explored (see also ‘Corner verandahs and balconies’ below).  
 New openings and alterations to existing openings should be kept to the 
minimum required to support a viable and sustainable use.   
 The rhythm of arch-headed openings on the ground level and flat lintels on 
the upper levels should be maintained.   
 The ground plane should not be raised to the extent that the brick plinth is 
concealed.   
West elevation 
 The existing entry to the west elevation of B Block should be retained as the 
principal point of arrival to the building.   
 The introduction of sun-shading to the west elevation can be contemplated, 
if required.  There have been at least two iterations of sun shading systems 
at the building over time (Figure 49 and Figure 50).  The approach adopted 
should be as visually unobtrusive as possible and minimise physical impacts.

Link elements 
 The link elements between the blocks have been modified over time and can 
be modified again to support a new use.  Built fabric should be recessive to 
the main building line, to enable an ongoing appreciation of the original 
planning.   
 Where change to the link elements is proposed, a preference is for change to 
the focussed on the rear (east) elevation.  
Corner verandahs 
and balconies 
 Corner verandahs and balconies were distinctive features of the building as 
designed.  Opportunities for their reinstatement should be explored, based 
on documentary evidence.   
Fenestration 
 The existing aluminium windows were introduced in the 1980s.  These 
frames can be retained or replaced as required.  If replaced, a preference 
from a heritage perspective is for the introduction of a frame that 
references the character and proportions of the original.

Principles to guide future change 
Image 
 
 
Policy 18 
New development 
The introduction of new buildings at the subject site should be sensitive to the heritage values of the 
place, including the presentation of West Block and its siting in relation to the Land Axis.  
The subject site has been subject to incremental change since the 1930s.  Change has focussed on the 
main building mass, in the form of small additions and larger works (D Block).  With the exception of the 
Dugout, there is no precedent for the introduction of new freestanding elements/buildings.  However, 
recognising that change is imminent, it is considered that new works within the site is an action that can 
reasonably be contemplated.   
With regards to new development, there is a balance to be struck between the site’s heritage values and 
attributes, and the objectives of the NCP.  The NCP contemplates development on the car park site to 
the east of West Block; a building of broadly equivalent footprint is also anticipated to the west of East 
Block.  The NCP also promotes a campus-style approach to development relating to Old Parliament 
House, East Block and West Block.  At the time the NCP was amended to include the campus model, the 
three buildings were in common ownership.  Since the disposal of East Block and West Block in 2017, 
that is no longer the case, a reality with consequences for the delivery of a co-ordinated approach to the 
use and operation of the three buildings.   
Having regard to the above, a preferred approach to new development is one which: 
 
Does not obscure key views and visual relationships, as identified in this conservation policy – 
i.e. Commonwealth Avenue;  
 
Delivers a new built form (or forms) that does not rise above the parapet of West Block (AHD 
581.10);  
 
Keeps the footprint of a new building (or buildings) to the minimum required, recognising 
West Block’s contribution to the symmetry of the Parliament House Vista;  
 
Delivers a package of conservation works to the retained significant fabric and elements; and  
 
Includes on-site interpretation to promote an understanding of the site’s history and cultural 
heritage significance (see also Policy 24 ‘Interpretation’) 
A preferred location for new works is to the rear (east) of West Block, set away from Queen Victoria 
Terrace (and Old Parliament House) and set into the embankment to minimise its presence in key views 
of the building (Figure 51).  
The appearance of new works, and the palette of materials, can contrast with West Block, but not in an 
obtrusive way.  The new building elevations should desirably be treated so as to visually ‘recede’ in 
views from the public realm.  A simple façade treatment, such as one with extensive glazing or a limited 
palette of materials, or simple detailing, would achieve this.  Consideration may be given to the use of

timber cladding, a subtle reference to the ‘temporary’ nature of West Block in the 1920s, and the use of 
timber for the framing of the upper levels.

Source: www.nearmap.com  
Small-scale additions 
If small-scale additions are required to support a viable and sustainable new use for West Block, such as 
pergolas or a porte-cochère, they should be of generally light weight construction and set clear from the 
historic building fabric.   
Naming signage 
West Block was designed without signage applied to the building exterior.  Bronze serif lettering was 
mounted over the main entry in the early post-World War II period, reading ‘Commonwealth Offices 
West Block’ (Figure 52).   By the 1980s this had been simplified to ‘West Block’.  Over time, signage 
denoting the use of the building has also been mounted to D Block, south elevation and to the rear 
(east) elevation of B Block.  If signage is required as related to a new use for West Block, this should be 
kept to the minimum required and in preference limited to the west elevation (B Block) and south 
elevation (D Block).

Policy 19 
Re-establishment of original landscape features 
Missing or diminished aspects of the original landscape treatment should be re-established.  
The original formal planting arrangement to the north of West Block should, in preference, be re-
established.  This arrangement, indicated at Figure 53, includes Lombardy poplars (Populus nigra 
‘Italica’) in small square enclosures as an extension of the axial vista.  This arrangement was balanced on 
the north side of Queen Victoria Terrace, where these plantings have already been regenerated, and it 
would be appropriate to duplicate the current treatment of shaped hedges, edging pavements and 
other details which is established on the north side of the Terrace.  At West Block, the termination of 
the axis was further developed in a broader formal setting of four Arizona cypress trees (Cupressus 
arizonica), all of which are extant today. 
It is noted that one of the original Lombardy poplars on the south side of Queen Victoria Terrace, within 
the West Block curtilage, presently survives. It is appropriate to continue the retention of this tree as 
long as arboriculturally feasible, while reinstating the eastern partner tree of the pairing with new 
(preferably advanced) stock.  When removal and replacement of the existing tree is ultimately required, 
a determination may be made as to the efficacy and aesthetic impact of maintaining two generationally 
non-matching trees versus the concurrent removal and replacement of both trees.  
If the opportunity arises, reinstatement of the Lombardy poplar pair at the northwest corner of the car 
park, adjacent to the Queen Victoria Terrace / Commonwealth Avenue intersection, is also encouraged.

An alternating row of Giant redwood (Sequiadendron giganteum) and Atlantic Cedar (Cedrus atlantica) 
originally provided continuity with a large-scale avenue planting of the same species which was 
established on the irregularly-shaped parkland block to the north-west.  While trees from this alignment 
have been progressively lost, two of the Atlantic cedars and one of the Giant redwoods still stand 
between the West Block car park and Commonwealth Avenue, as do a number of the constituent trees 
of the northern alignment to the north.  It would be appropriate to establish infill plantings to 
regenerate the continuity and form of this avenue while retaining the existing trees within their feasible 
lifespans. 
Policy 20 
Changes to the landscape 
Any changes to the landscape setting and broader heritage curtilage should be sensitive to the heritage 
values of the place.   
Changes to the landscaping around West Block should be guided by the plan of permanent plantings for 
the Governmental Group of 1928 (Appendix B).  The insertion of new structural or planted elements, 
and the modification or reconstruction of existing features, may be accommodated in the landscape 
provided that such change is undertaken in a manner sympathetic and subservient to the setting’s 
character as designed and as extant within the place today, and in accordance with other relevant 
policies in this HMP, including Policy 18. 
New plantings and structural elements should be consistent with the original characters of Zone 1 and 
Zone 2.  Where practical, species selections should be drawn from the original planting specifications 
and should otherwise be sympathetic to the character and intent of those selections.  The informal 
native character of Zone 2 should be maintained.

Similarly, the location and treatment of new hard surfaces and structural landscape elements should be 
consistent with the original formal organisation and features of the place, with the division of circulation 
networks and with the architectural character of West Block.  While new elements should employ 
materials or details which differentiate them from original fabric, they should be sympathetic to the 
form and qualities of that fabric and consistent with the treatment of similar elements elsewhere within 
the Parliamentary Triangle precinct.  
Policy 21 
Recording 
Geocon, and subsequent owners, should maintain a record of significant interventions to West Block and 
the Dugout   
Records of works/interventions to West Block should be maintained by Geocon.  The record (or file) 
should include copies of all superseded architectural drawings, and photography of the affected areas 
before and after the works.   
The outcomes of on-going (i.e. cyclical) monitoring of significant fabric and landscape 
elements/attributes should also be recorded by Geocon (and subsequent owners), to assist in 
maintaining the site’s Commonwealth heritage values.  (See also Policy 12 ‘Cyclical maintenance and 
remedial works to significant built fabric’ and Policy 14 ‘Landscape maintenance’.) 
This policy complies with EPBC Act Regulations, 2000, Schedule 7a (h) (x) and Schedule 7a (h) (ix).  
5.5 
Management policies 
Policy 22 
Statutory controls  
West Block should continue to be recognised as a place of cultural heritage significance to Australia 
through its inclusion in the Commonwealth Heritage list. 
West Block has been assessed as a place of significance to Australia.  As such, it should continue to be 
managed under the provisions of the EPBC Act 1999.  
In the event that West Block is removed from the CHL, it should be nominated for inclusion in the ACT 
Heritage Register.   
Policy 23 
Training and awareness 
A training program should be instigated to raise awareness of the heritage significance of West Block 
among Geocon staff.  
The heritage significance of West Block may not be self-evident to casual observers, and those outside 
the heritage profession.  It is recommended that a training program to promote awareness of the 
building’s heritage values is developed and implemented by Geocon as related to the proposed 
adaptation of the building as a hotel.  
Policy 24 
Access and security 
Access to West Block and its setting for people with an interest in the place should be accommodated by 
the owners and operators of West Block, subject to appropriate security measures. 
West Block was built as an office, a use that it served from 1927 into the twenty-first century.  The 
building exterior was experienced by Canberrians as an element of the Parliamentary Triangle precinct.  
The building interior was the preserve of office workers and visitors to the building.  The Dugout has 
been a secure building since 1943, with no public access.   
As a long-standing feature of the Parliamentary Triangle landscape, members of the public, including the 
organisations, groups and individuals identified as stakeholders at Section 4.4, may have an interest in

107 
West Block.  There is also the potential for interest in the Dugout, associated with its World War II 
history.  Further, as noted in Chapter 1 and discussed at Policy 25 below, Traditional Owner groups have 
expressed a wish to access the grounds because of its location on a pathway between Black Mountain 
and Mount Kurrajong.   
It would be appropriate for the owners and operators of the Commonwealth Heritage listed place to 
allow interested parties to access West Block and its setting.  For security purposes, people wishing to 
visit the building should make themselves known to staff at the building and advise of the intended 
length of their visit.  Depending on the use of the building, the operators may wish to limit internal 
access to common areas on the ground floor.   
This policy complies with EPBC Act Regulations, 2000, Schedule 7a (h) (ii).   
Policy 25 
Interpretation and promotion of heritage values 
Geocon and subsequent owners of West Block should promote and disseminate information about the 
Commonwealth Heritage Values of the place.   
Strategies for the promotion and dissemination of information about the cultural heritage values of 
West Block should be prepared in the form of an interpretation plan.  Recommendations for 
interpretation should be informed by but not limited to consideration of: best practice principles 
(including the Burra Charter 2013 practice note ‘Interpretation’); the identified heritage values of the 
place; the anticipated audience for interpretation; and existing interpretive programs at West Block 
(Figure 54).

Interpretation can be undertaken via a range of tools and methods.  Information can be presented in a 
readable format (printed or electronic, including brochures, pamphlets, books and websites); through 
on-site signage; through the display of objects/artefacts; and through art works.   
Interpretation of the place should acknowledge the site’s Indigenous heritage as a part of a pathway 
between the Black Mountain and Mount Kurrajong.  Stakeholder engagement should form part of any 
interpretation of the indigenous heritage of West Block.  
The historic value of West Block as a significant place during World War II in Canberra is an important 
part of the heritage interpretation.  This should include communication of the values not readily 
evident, including the planned and historic association between East Block, West Block and the 
Provisional Parliament House.   
The use of the Dugout as an air raid shelter and its important role in receiving and sending critical 
communication during war time should be interpreted on site.  Correspondingly, the display of the 
statue of Winston Churchill donated to Geocon by the Churchill Society in mid-2018 should occur within 
the context of the broader interpretation of the site as informed by the interpretation plan.    
It would be desirable for ‘West Block’ to be retained in the name of the premises, to maintain an 
understanding of the site’s origins – i.e. ‘Hotel West Block’, or similar.  
Policy 26 
Archaeology 
The discovery of historical archaeological artefacts and objects, which can contribute to an 
understanding of the history of the site and its context, should be reported to the Department of the 
Environment and Energy.   
The site of West Block was partially excavated in the mid-1920s, to establish a level site for construction.  
This activity, as well as grading works for the establishment of the integral car park and the landscape 
setting generally, means, there is limited potential for subsurface artefacts relating to earlier occupation 
and/or land use at the site.  Exceptions may relate to subsurface evidence of pneumatic tubes that 
connected the buildings of the Parliament House group during the 1940s, and evidence of World War II-
era defences (i.e. trenches).   
In the event of archaeological remains being uncovered at the site, DoEE should be informed of the 
discovery before proceeding with further work.   
Policy 27 
Risk preparedness 
A Risk Management Strategy should be integrated into the broader management and administration of 
West Block.   
Risk preparedness and management is an important means of protecting and conserving the values of 
heritage places.  While a detailed assessment of risk is beyond the scope of this report, the following 
table describes potential threats and hazards posed to the physical fabric at the subject site by 
environmental and man-made factors.

Vandalism and 
theft 
Moderate 
Vandalism and theft are always possible and a normal level of 
awareness and security should be maintained.  Installation of 
security cameras could be considered in discrete locations.  
These should be fixed to cause the minimum possible impact 
on the presentation of the tower.  
Fire 
Always present 
Establish a fire suppression and warning system as part of any 
adaptive re-use, and upgrade as required.  Ensure there is an 
evacuation plan in place, and conduct regular training and 
rehearsals.  Ensure that combustible materials do not come 
into contact with hot lights.  Ensure that extinguishers, fire 
blankets etc, are located within reach of potential sources of 
fire.  Maintain electrical systems in good order.  Maintain 
liaison with fire brigade to regularly test and monitor systems. 
Flood 
Possible 
Localised internal flooding, from toilets, sinks and pipe work, 
is always possible.  Maintenance of wet areas and pipe work 
is a means of minimising this possibility. 
Water ingress 
Moderate 
Rainwater goods (gutters, downpipes and sumps) should be 
repaired (where required), maintained, installed and kept 
clear.  Inspect and maintain roofs, windows and doors 
regularly.
