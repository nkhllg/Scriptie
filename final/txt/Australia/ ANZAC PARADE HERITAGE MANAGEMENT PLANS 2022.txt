Australian War Memorial—Heritage Management Plan—Revised Final Report, March 2022
Executive Summary
War memorials are ubiquitous expressions of Australian nationhood. They appear amongst every 
concentration of people across the country, from our cities to our tiny outback towns. But the grandest 
of these expressions, the monument that strives to honour all forms of remembrance and all events that 
need to be remembered, is the Australian War Memorial (AWM) in Canberra.
The AWM is Australia’s National Shrine to those Australians who lost their lives and suffered as a result 
of war. It is an important place to the Australian community as a whole and has special associations with 
veterans and their families and descendants of those who fought in wars for Australia.
The AWM is unique in Australia and believed rare in the world as a purpose built repository where the 
nature of commemoration is based in equal parts in the relationship between the building, the collections 
of objects and records and the commemorative spaces.
Its physical presence alone is a dominant feature of the nation’s capital: an Art Deco edifice at the head 
of Anzac Parade facing the federal houses of parliament across Lake Burley Griffin.
A shrine, a museum, an archive, a formal landscape and an outstanding collection of buildings, the AWM 
offers itself to the nation as a place for reflection, research, education and ceremony. It embodies many 
heritage values which are recognised by its inclusion in the National Heritage List along with Anzac 
Parade, the Commonwealth Heritage List, the Register of the National Estate, the ACT Royal Australian 
Institute of Architects’ National Heritage List and Register of Significant Twentieth Century Architecture, 
the ACT National Trust Register.
The Commonwealth’s Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) and 
its accompanying regulations (EPBC Regulations) oblige government agencies to conserve and manage 
the heritage values of sites in their control. The legislation defines heritage principles that agencies must 
follow and directs agencies to create documents for guiding their care of heritage places, including this 
Heritage Management Plan.
This Heritage Management Plan (HMP) acts as a practical guide for conserving, managing and 
interpreting the site’s heritage. It begins by describing the AWM in detail: its history, its features and its 
heritage values. It discusses factors that need to be considered when managing the site, such as its 
statutory context and compliance requirements. The final sections of the plan provide conservation 
policies for the place’s managers and staff to follow. The report includes a collection of appendices that 
give further guidance and detailed information for asset managers and curators alike.
To conserve the AWM’s heritage values, the heritage legislation, a range of organisations and the 
general public, other management documents, logistics, forward planning and changing cultural attitudes 
need to be considered. This HMP acknowledges the significant obligations they place on the site’s 
managers and emphasises the need for community involvement and great care in any future 
development of the AWM.
Mindful of these issues, this plan provides useful policies to guide the Memorial to care for the site’s 
heritage values from day to day. Section 6.2 outlines general policies for the whole site and Section 6.3 
focuses on individual parts in more detail. The policies cover conservation processes; management 
processes; stakeholder consultation and community involvement; interpretation; documentation, 
monitoring and review; and use, access and security. Recommended actions and timing for 
implementation are provided for each policy.

Australian War Memorial—Heritage Management Plan—Revised Final Report, March 2022
To put these policies into practice, the Memorial will formally adopt this HMP. Specific policies and 
actions will need to be implemented by the head of Buildings and Services and other sections will have 
roles to play as well.
The HMP offers various tools to guide policy implementation. Along with the recommended actions 
mentioned above these tools include an outline of a decision-making process and a works assessment 
for to help assess the heritage impacts of proposed actions at the site (provided as Appendices A and 
B).
This HMP relates to the AWM at the time of drafting (September 2018—June 2021). The information 
and policies in this document therefore reflect the status and condition of the AWM at this time. As the 
AWM undergoes changes associated with scheduled upcoming development, this program of works will 
be managed in accordance with the conditions of the project’s regulatory approvals and this HMP, where 
applicable. Updates to the topics in this HMP which reflect the outcomes of the development project will 
be implemented in the next version of the HMP.
The HMP confirms that the following key principles are essential to protect the national heritage 
significance of this important site:
•
When considering change or development at the site, consult widely.
•
Always be consistent with the HMP when taking any action that will affect features with heritage 
value.
•
Integrate the HMP with the Memorial’s daily asset management and curatorial practices.
•
Constantly monitor the implementation of this document and the condition of the site’s heritage 
values.
•
In accordance with the EPBC Act provisions, review this plan after major changes in circumstance, 
including the completion of the AWM development project, or every five years, whichever is earlier.

Commonwealth 
Heritage List (CHL)
The CHL is a list of heritage places which are within a Commonwealth area (land 
owned or leased by the Commonwealth) which have been identified as having one 
or more Commonwealth Heritage values. To have Commonwealth Heritage values 
a place must have been assessed as being significant against one or more of the 
nine Commonwealth Heritage criteria. Places in the list can have natural, 
Indigenous and/or historic heritage values, or a combination of these, and range 
from places of local through to world heritage levels of importance.
Commonwealth 
Heritage criteria
Under s 341D of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 
1999 (Cth) (EPBC Act), these are the criteria prescribed in the EPBC Regulations 
at reg 10.03A to establish if a place within a Commonwealth area has significant 
heritage value for its natural, Indigenous or historic heritage values.
Commonwealth 
Heritage values
Commonwealth Heritage values are the legally listed values for which a place is 
included in the CHL. These can comprise one or more natural and cultural (historic or 
Indigenous) aspects such as significance for reasons of historical, research, 
aesthetic or social importance, or due to a place’s significant rarity, creative or 
technical achievement, characteristic features of a class of place, association with

Environment 
Protection and 
Biodiversity 
Conservation Act 
1999 (Cth) (EPBC 
Act)
The EPBC Act is the key piece of Commonwealth environmental legislation in 
Australia. It provides a legal framework to protect and manage nationally and 
internationally important flora, fauna, ecological communities and heritage places. 
The Act defines and protects these ‘matters of national environmental significance’ 
(MNES) as:
•
world heritage properties
•
national heritage places
•
wetlands of international importance (listed under the Ramsar Convention)
•
listed threatened species and ecological communities
•
migratory species protected under international agreements
•
Commonwealth marine areas
•
Great Barrier Reef Marine Park
•
nuclear actions (including uranium mines)
•
a water resource, in relation to coal seam gas development and 
large coal mining development.
The EPBC Act also regulates actions on, or impacting on, the environment on 
Commonwealth land, or actions by Commonwealth agencies impacting the 
environment in general. This includes protecting heritage values on Commonwealth 
land and controlling actions taken by the Commonwealth that may have a significant 
impact on the environment, including heritage values.
Heritage 
Assessment (HA)
A HA is a report that includes the history and physical description of the property, 
along with analysis of environmental history and archaeological potential. 
Comparison with similar sites with identified heritage values is included. Historical 
themes using the Australian Historical Themes Framework are identified, where 
relevant. Assessment of this information against the criteria for the NHL and CHL is 
included, and a summary statement of heritage significance is provided.
Heritage Impact 
Assessment (HIA)
A HIA is a report that analyses the potential impacts of a proposal on the heritage 
values of a place. The HIA also identifies mitigation and management measures to 
reduce the severity of impacts, where possible. Mitigation measures can include 
retention and re-use of building fabric on site, interpretation of heritage values, 
archival recording, undertaking oral history interviews and preparing a publication 
on the history and heritage values of the site.
Key inputs to a HIA include the alternatives considered in the planning process for the 
proposal. A HIA can include a HA where this has not been prepared to date.
A HIA assists with deciding if a proposal needs to be referred under the EPBC Act. 
HIAs need to be prepared using the EPBC ACT Significant Impact Guidelines 1.1 
and 1.2. For more information on these refer to the ‘Useful Guides’ section below.
Heritage 
Management Plan 
(HMP)
HMPs are prepared for places included in the NHL, CHL, or places with identified 
heritage values established through a heritage assessment against the 
Commonwealth or National Heritage criteria. They are intended to help managers 
to conserve and protect the National and Commonwealth Heritage values of a 
place by setting out the conservation policies to be followed.
HMPs need to be prepared in accordance with the requirements of the EPBC 
Regulations, including the National and Commonwealth Heritage management 
principles. HMPs include the HA (either integrated or as an appendix) and provide 
heritage compliance guidance, assess risks to heritage values, and provide 
detailed policies and guidelines to support the conservation management of the 
property’s identified heritage values. A maintenance guide and action plan can also 
be included to assist with implementing the HMP.
Heritage Register
This is a database of heritage places or assets managed by the Memorial, and is a 
requirement under s 341ZB of the EPBC Act.
Heritage Strategy
This is a document that provides for the integration of heritage conservation and 
management within the Memorial’s overall property planning and management 
framework and is a requirement under s 341ZA of EPBC Act.
Identified heritage 
values
Identified heritage values refers to those values that have been identified through a 
heritage assessment, tested and found to meet the applicable threshold but have 
not been nominated or officially listed.

Australian War Memorial—Heritage Management Plan—Revised Final Report, March 2022
1.0 Introduction
1.1 Background
The AWM is a national shrine, a museum and an archive located in the northern Canberra suburb of 
Campbell in the Australian Capital Territory (ACT). It is managed by the Memorial and is a major research 
centre and tourist attraction, now consistently attracting more than one million visitors per year.1
These functions of the AWM are supported by the AWM Mitchell Precinct, which is also managed by the 
Memorial. The AWM Mitchell Precinct, consisting of Treloar A (also known as Annex A), Treloar B, 
Treloar C, Treloar D (the Old Post Office), Treloar E and Treloar F (currently under lease), provides 
additional storage and conservation facilities for the AWM collection in the suburb of Mitchell, ACT.
The values of the AWM are recognised through its inclusion in the National Heritage List (NHL) and the 
Commonwealth Heritage List (CHL) (refer to Appendix E and F for the official citations). The EPBC Act 
requires that a HMP be prepared for National and Commonwealth Heritage places to conserve, present 
and transmit their heritage values.
This HMP has been prepared by GML Heritage Pty Ltd (GML) in line with the requirements of the EPBC 
Act and its Regulations. A compliance table showing how this HMP meets the requirements of the EPBC 
Act and its Regulations is included at Appendix C. Additional text has been provided by the Memorial, in 
particular on the Australian War Memorial Development Project 2019–2028, provided 27 November 
2021, at Sections 2.5, 5 and 6.
1.2 Previous Heritage and Conservation Management Plans
This HMP will update and replace the previous management plans for the AWM, which are listed as 
follows:
•
Godden Mackay Logan Pty Ltd 2011, Australian War Memorial Heritage Management Plan, 
prepared for the Australian War Memorial, Canberra;
•
Pearson, M and Crocket, G 1995, Australian War Memorial Conservation Management Plan 
(CMP), prepared for Bligh Voller Architects (referred to as the 1995 CMP);
•
Crocket, G 1997, Australian War Memorial Significance Assessment Report, prepared for Bligh 
Voller Architects; and
•
Bligh Voller Nield and HMC 1997, Australian War Memorial Heritage Conservation Masterplan, 
prepared for the Australian War Memorial.
The 1995 CMP was based on the Register of the National Estate (RNE) listing (date of listing 21 October 
1980, Place ID 13286). Entry in the Commonwealth Heritage List (CHL) occurred in 2004 while entry in 
the National Heritage List (NHL) occurred in 2006.
The Memorial has also produced a Heritage Strategy and Heritage Register to meet and manage its 
heritage obligations under the EPBC Act and its Regulations. The heritage values of the AWM Mitchell 
Precinct have been assessed in the AWM Heritage Register.

1.3 Location of the Site
The AWM is located in the ACT suburb of Campbell and is bounded by Limestone Avenue to the 
southwest, Fairbairn Avenue to the southeast and Treloar Crescent to the north. It is sited in a crucial 
symbolic location at the terminus of the land axis of Walter Burley Griffin’s plan for Canberra (refer to 
Figure 1.1).
The AWM has an area of approximately 14 hectares, including the whole of Section 39, Campbell, and 
is located at the foot of Mount Ainslie. This boundary is the area of land owned and controlled by the 
Memorial and is also the boundary of the Commonwealth Heritage listing for the AWM (refer to Section 
1.4).
The AWM comprises:
•
the main Memorial Building;
•
ANZAC Hall;
•
the CEW Bean Building;
•
the Administration Building;
•
Poppy’s café; and
•
landscaped grounds incorporating sculptures, memorials, large technology objects, plaques, the 
Parade Ground and commemorative and landscape plantings (refer to Figure 1.2).
During the drafting this plan (September 2018–June 2021) the Memorial has scheduled the 
commencement of a development project at the AWM Campbell site. The development includes the 
removal and replacement of Anzac Hall, creation of a glazed link connecting the main Memorial Building 
and the new Anzac Hall, and a new Research Centre. These elements will be located in, and around, 
the main Memorial Building. This project has been approved under the EPBC Act, and the Memorial will 
manage the project in accordance with the conditions of this approval; this includes management of the 
project under the previous Heritage Management Plan (2011) under which the proposal was developed, 
submitted and approved.

Australian War Memorial—Heritage Management Plan—Revised Final Report, March 2022
2.0 Understanding the Place—Historical Context
This section provides a summary of the history of both the AWM as a place and the Memorial as an 
organisation. It draws on the historical analysis presented in the 1995 CMP1 and 2011 HMP, 
supplemented with additional material relating to the recent history of the place.
Further historical information regarding individual elements within the AWM is provided in the Heritage 
Register.
2.1 Aboriginal Cultural and Historical Context
Tribal boundaries within Australia are largely based on linguistic evidence and it is probable that 
boundaries, clan estates and band ranges were fluid and varied over time. Consequently, ‘tribal 
boundaries’ as delineated today must be regarded as approximations only and relative to the period of, 
or immediately before, European contact. Social interaction across these language boundaries appears 
to have been a common occurrence.
According to Tindale,2 the territories of the Ngunawal, Ngarigo and the Walgalu peoples coincide and 
meet in the Queanbeyan area. The AWM probably falls within the tribal boundaries of the Ngunawal 
people.
References to the traditional Aboriginal inhabitants of the Canberra region are rare and often difficult to 
interpret.3 However, the consistent impression is one of rapid depopulation and a desperate 
disintegration of a traditional way of life over little more than 50 years from initial European contact.4 This 
process was probably accelerated by the impact of European diseases, which may have included the 
smallpox epidemic in 1830, influenza, and a severe measles epidemic by the 1860s.5
By the 1850s the traditional Aboriginal economy had largely been replaced by an economy based on 
European commodities and supply points. Reduced population, isolation from the most productive 
grasslands, and the destruction of traditional social networks meant that the final decades of the region’s 
semi-traditional Indigenous culture and economy was centred around European settlements and 
properties.6
By 1856 the local ‘Canberra Tribe’, presumably members of the Ngunawal, were reported to number 
around 707 and by 1872 only five or six ‘survivors’ were recorded.8 In 1873, one so-called ‘pure blood’ 
member remained, known to the European community as Nelly Hamilton or ‘Queen Nellie’.
Combined with other ethnohistorical evidence, this lack of early accounts of Aboriginal people led Flood 
9 to suggest that the Aboriginal population density in the Canberra region and Southern Uplands was 
generally quite low.
Frequently, only so called ‘pure blooded’ individuals were considered ‘Aboriginal’ or ‘tribal’ by European 
observers. This consideration made possible the assertion of local tribal ‘extinctions’. In reality, ‘Koori’ 
and tribal identity remained integral to the descendants of the nineteenth-century Ngunawal people, 
some of whom continue to live in the Canberra/Queanbeyan/Yass region.
2.2 Origins and Establishment
The origins of the AWM are integrally associated with CEW Bean, Australia’s official war correspondent 
during World War I (refer to Figure 2.1). Bean envisioned a national war museum in Australia’s new 
capital, Canberra, which would house the relics and trophies of battle. At the same time, Bean was 
actively working towards earning Australia the right to keep and maintain its own war

records, following the success of Canada in this regard in 1916. In May 1917, Lieutenant John Treloar 
was appointed officer-in-charge of the Australian War Records Section, before serving as Director of the 
Memorial between 1920 and 1952 (refer to Figure 2.2).

War Records, and Director of the AWM for 32 years. 
(Source: Australian War Memorial, ID number 023405)
Earlier in 1917 the Commonwealth had indicated support for Bean’s concept of a national war museum 
in Canberra and by 1918 Bean had strengthened his vision to link the collected war relics and war 
records with the idea of a lasting memorial to those who had died in the war. An Australian War Museum 
committee was established in 1919 and Henry Gullett was appointed first Director of the Museum. Bean 
and Treloar believed that the memorial and museum functions were philosophically and operationally 
inseparable and, along with Gullett, they were to guide its creation and operation over a 40-year period.
The existing site of the AWM may have been considered by Bean as early as 1919. Charles Daley, 
Secretary of the Federal Capital Advisory Committee, claims to have suggested the site where Walter 
Burley Griffin had located his ‘Casino’—at the terminal of the main land axis of the city plan. In 1923, the 
Commonwealth finally announced its intention to proceed with this site for the ‘Australian War Memorial’ 
and in 1925 the AWM was constituted in Commonwealth legislation. The AWM was inaugurated on 25 
April 1929 (refer to Figure 2.3).

The competition for the design of the AWM was conducted from 1925–1926. However, none of the 
entries met all of the competition’s conditions and no winner was announced. Two of the competitors, 
Emil Sodersten (formerly Sodersteen) and John Crust, were subsequently asked to develop a new 
collaborative design incorporating the architectural style of Sodersteen and the innovative and cost- 
cutting approach of Crust. The new joint Sodersteen and Crust design was presented in 1927. The 
architectural style of the design was primarily Sodersteen’s work and drew upon the then recent 
development of the Art Deco style from Europe. This architectural styling became popular in Canberra 
in the postwar period, influencing buildings such as the Institute of Anatomy (now the National Film and 
Sound Archive) built in 1928–1930. The form of the AWM and design of the main Memorial building was 
also strongly influenced by Crust’s intention to incorporate a commemorative courtyard for the Roll of 
Honour, along with CEW Bean’s original concept for a central ‘great hall’, now the Hall of Memory.
Construction at the AWM, which began in 1928–1929, was curtailed and then postponed by the onset 
of the Depression. In 1934, the ‘Lone Pine’ propagated from seed brought back from the battlefield of 
Gallipoli was planted within the otherwise denuded landscape (refer to Figure 2.4). Some construction 
work started again but many details of the building remained unresolved. While the main Memorial 
building is one of Australia’s earliest major buildings designed and constructed in the Art Deco style, the 
design was subject to a host of changes and the details of the building were not finally settled until 1936.

In 1937 the Memorial’s Board resolved to commission sculpture, stained glass windows and mosaics to 
complete the Hall of Memory. Napier Waller, a noted Australian artist in large scale murals and mosaics, 
was invited to submit designs for both the mosaic and stained glass. Leslie Bowles was commissioned 
to produce designs for the large scale sculpture. Both artists had served in the armed forces in World 
War I. During World War II, the interiors of the Hall of Memory were reconsidered, and Percy Meldrum 
collaborated with the artists to help solve the architectural issues of the applied decoration. While Waller 
was able to proceed with his designs for mosaics, Bowles’ models were rejected. Ray Ewers continued 
Bowles’ work, with the design for the ‘Australian servicemen’ being accepted in 1955. The installation of 
the mosaics also commenced in 1955, under the supervision of Aldo Rossi and Severino de Marco (refer 
to Figure 2.5). The Hall of Memory was finally opened in 1959 (refer to Figure 2.6).

Parts of the main Memorial building were occupied by AWM staff and collections as early as 1935, 
although the main structure was not completed until 1941 (Figure 2.7–Figure 2.8). The official opening 
on 11 November 1941, Remembrance Day, acknowledged that the building was substantially complete, 
however, some areas were not finished until many years later.

One of the outcomes of the long construction period was the evolution of enhanced display technology 
for the collection. Another was the advent of World War II. In 1939, the intended role of the AWM—to 
commemorate those who died in World War I, then known as the Great War—was reviewed. After much 
consideration, the Board of the Memorial recommended in 1941 that the scope of the Australian War 
Memorial Act be extended to incorporate the new war and Treloar transferred to the Department of 
Information as the Head of Military History Section at Army Headquarters to coordinate the collection of 
relics and records arising from that conflict. As a result, plans for the extension of the main Memorial 
building were prepared c1947, although not constructed until the 1960s. The Australian War Memorial 
Act was again amended in 1952 to extend its scope to include Australian involvement in all wars. In 1975 
the scope was further broadened to allow commemoration of Australians who died as a result of war, 
but who had not served in the Australian armed forces.10
2.3 Expansion and Evolution
The AWM is a place that has always adapted by responding to society’s changing need for 
commemoration and perceptions of the significance of military history generally. The decision to include 
World War II in the scope of the AWM necessitated extensions to the space available for display (refer 
to Figure 2.10). In 1961 the Roll of Honour panels commemorating the dead of World War I were installed 
within the cloisters (refer to Figure 2.9). Supplementary panels commemorating later conflicts have 
continued to be installed since the 1960s, with the panels updated annually to reflect those involved in 
ongoing conflicts. In 1968–1971 two wings were constructed to extend the transepts of the main 
Memorial building. These extensions were entirely in keeping with the original concept of the building, 
utilising the same design and stonework. The extensions of the transepts

enhanced the symmetry of the design and their scale offset the ‘Byzantinesque’ dome and reinforced 
the church-like cruciform plan of the building. The first ancillary building to be built was the Outpost Café, 
constructed in 1960 (refer to Figure 2.11).
In 1988 the Administration Building was the first significant additional structure to be added to the AWM, 
allowing the transfer of administrative functions from the main Memorial building.

2.4 New Meanings
The installation of the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Solider in 1993 signalled another significant 
evolution in the meaning of the AWM. The famous speech delivered by the then prime minister, Paul 
Keating, at the interment signalled that, more than ever before, the sacrifice of ordinary men and women 
in war was seen as crucial to national identity:11
The Unknown Australian Soldier we inter today was one of those who by his deeds proved that 
real nobility and grandeur belongs not to empires and nations but to the people on whom they, in 
the last resort, always depend.
That is surely at the heart of the Anzac story, the Australian legend which emerged from the war. 
It is a legend not of sweeping military victories so much as triumphs against the odds, of courage 
and ingenuity in adversity. It is a legend of free and independent spirits whose discipline derived 
less from military formalities and customs than from the bonds of mateship and the demands of 
necessity.
It has been suggested that with the interment of the Unknown Australian Soldier the meaning of the Hall 
of Memory has been clarified and entrenched as a national mausoleum and the heart of the AWM.12 
With the growth of the importance of ‘heritage’ through the 1990s, memorials to war have taken on new 
meanings in Australian society; it has been argued that they provide a mythology or even a sacred 
component for the secular modern nation.13 This is reflected in a dynamic period of change and 
development across the AWM, mirroring the rise in the symbolic cultural importance of memorials which 
commemorate the sacrifice of Australians in war. From the mid-1990s to the present, the Memorial has 
expanded and upgraded its galleries and exhibitions and also made significant changes to its 
surrounding grounds. Between 1996 and 1999, the Memorial undertook Gallery Development Stage 
One. This included redeveloping the Second World War Galleries and Research Centre, relocating and 
changing the Post 1945 Galleries, the redesign and expansion of the Orientation Gallery and the creation 
of a temporary exhibition space. These were opened by then Prime Minister John Howard.

This period also included the final stage of development of the Western Courtyard and Sculpture Garden. 
The Aircraft Hall was completed shortly after. ANZAC Hall, adjoining the rear of the main Memorial 
building, was completed in 2001. This provided a major new exhibition space where large objects are 
now presented in an ‘object theatre’ manner. This building was awarded the Sir Zelman Cowen Award 
for Best Public Building by the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA) in 2005.
The subsequent stage of redevelopment, Gallery Development Two, centred around the development 
of the Conflicts 1945 to Today Galleries on the lower level of the main Memorial building and the new 
Discovery Zone, a hands-on education centre that opened in 2007. To facilitate this development, staff 
and some of the collection were required to relocate to a new building, constructed on the eastern side 
of the main Memorial building. Named after CEW Bean, the building was opened in April 2006. It is 
connected to the main Memorial building by a tunnel. The new offices were opened in February 2008. 
The Conflicts 1945 to Today galleries display collections from conflicts that Australia has been involved 
in since World War II, including various peacekeeping missions. They were opened by Prime Minister 
Kevin Rudd. These galleries display major collection items, such as an Iroquois helicopter from the 
Vietnam War, and have also reinvigorated the Memorial’s use of dioramas by developing one based on 
the Battle of Kapyong during the Korean War. Nearby a ‘virtual’ electronic diorama was produced on the 
Battle of Maryang San. Australia’s involvement in conflicts since 1945, including Korea (1950– 1953), 
Vietnam (1962–1975), the Malayan Emergency (1948–1960) and the Indonesian Confrontation (1962–
1966) are interpreted. Also included in these galleries is a link to a display in the bridge of the HMAS 
Brisbane, which has been installed outside the main Memorial building. This ship saw action in the 
Vietnam War and the First Gulf War.
In 2004 the Parade Ground, on the southern face of the AWM, was redeveloped to improve access and 
comfort for spectators and dignitaries at ceremonial events. The design used the same materials as in 
the main Memorial building, in keeping with the national significance of this site. All of the existing 
terraces were demolished, leaving only the Stone of Remembrance. Sandstone terraces and a forecourt 
were created around the stone. The design has successfully enhanced the relationship between the 
AWM and Anzac Parade and is a fittingly grand, yet simple, design for this significant ceremonial area.

2.4.1 The Western Precinct—1999 to Present
The Western Precinct of the AWM was remodelled in 1999 for the creation of the commemorative 
Sculpture Garden—a place to display individual memorials and a range of significant sculptures from 
the Memorial’s collection. In 1995, Ray Ewers’ monumental ‘Australian Serviceman’ was moved from 
the Hall of Memory to the Sculpture Garden and other works have subsequently been sited in the area. 
The sculptures have been linked with commemorative plantings, including the earliest planting on the 
site, the Lone Pine. Sir Betram Mackennal’s famous bust ‘Bellona’ or ‘War’ was sited near the Lone Pine 
in 1998. This new location is particularly appropriate because Mackennal is said to have presented the 
work to the Commonwealth Government as a mark of respect for the valour exhibited at Gallipoli.
Two new memorials were commissioned in 1998 (British Commonwealth Occupation Force) and 1999 
(Australian Servicewomen’s memorial). These more architectural memorials contrast with the 
monumentality and figurative nature of the earlier bronze sculptures which have been relocated to the 
garden. Since this time, a total of 25 memorials or sculptures have been installed within the formalised 
grounds of the AWM, and 10 large objects put on display. Over 150 plaques which commemorate 
individual unit associations have also been located in the garden.
Western Precinct Memorials
Since 1999 a number of memorials have been installed in the Western Precinct.

General Sir John Monash (2018)
Figure 2.18 Sir John Monash sculpture, Australian War Memorial (Source: Australian War Memorial).
A sculpture of Sir John Monash was commissioned in 2016 to commemorate Sir John Monash’s legacy as an 
outstanding general of the First World War and his dedication to civic duty in the years after the war. It comprises 
of a larger than life size bronze realist figure of the older Sir John Monash clothed in a suit and displaying his 
military medals, gazing outward on top of a plinth cast in cement to resemble a large outcrop of striated 
sedimentary rock.
Monash stands with one foot placed on a rocky rise, signifying his commanding view of Australia’s destiny in 
its global context. The strength of his gaze and purposeful profile signifies his vision and leadership. His clothes 
intimate that he was a man of his time, however, the inclusion of the phrase “I am living and moving” asserts 
Monash’s continuing centrality to Australian cultural life, the way his legacy still lives and moves in us today. 
He holds a notebook in his right hand, alluding to his great intellectual legacy as a moving and humane 
chronicler of the war, as well as one of its greatest tacticians and leaders Symbolically, the rock functions both 
as a testament to Monash’s intellectual strength and fortitude, but also to the burden of responsibility that fell 
to him during his service and public life. The concrete plinth also gestures towards Monash’s pioneering work 
as an engineer in introducing reinforced concrete as a material in construction.
The modelling of the figure and fabrication of the plinth was carried out in the Visual Arts Workshops at 
Queensland University of Technology over a period of 4 months from October 2017. The figure and rings were 
cast in bronze at Billman’s Foundry, Castlemaine, Victoria in March 2018.

For Our Country (2018)
Figure 2.19 'For Our Country' sculpture (Source: Australian War Memorial).
'For our Country' recognises the military service of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. It is a 
space in which to commemorate their service in all conflicts in which Australia's military has been 
deployed. It is also a place to contemplate the sacrifices that Indigenous Australians have made and 
continue to make in defence of Country.
The idea for the commission was raised in 2016, following national consultation on the Memorial’s 
recognition and acknowledgement of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander service. Boyd and Edition 
Office’s design was selected from a shortlist of submissions and approved by a group of Indigenous 
military personnel, curators, and local Elders.
In 2018 artist Daniel Boyd, a Kudjala/Gangalu/Kuku, Yalanji/Waka, Waka/Gubbi Gubbi/Wangerriburra/ 
Bandjalung man from North Queensland, and Edition Office architects were commissioned to design a 
new sculpture for the Memorial Sculpture Gardens that recognised and commemorated the military 
service and experiences of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.
For our Country takes the form of a sculptural pavilion that measures 11 metres wide and 3 metres high, 
set behind a ceremonial fire pit within a circular stone field. From the front of the pavilion visitors see a 
wall of two-way mirrored glass covered in thousands of transparent lenses that reflect the viewer and 
the Memorial.
Connection to landscape is important to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture. The memorial 
contains soil deposited from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Nations across Australia. The artist 
intended that each Nation be commemorated in this place, where the soil of their Country joins the many 
lands our ancestors have defended and from which they came to serve Australia.

Flanders Field Memorial Garden (2013)
Figure 2.20 Flanders Field Memorial Garden (Source: Australian War Memorial).
The Flanders Fields Memorial Garden is set within a formal grass court in the Australian War Memorial’s 
Western Precinct. An adjacent bronze plaque includes a dedication listing the Australian divisions that 
fought in Flanders, their insignia, and the cemeteries in which their members are buried.
The Garden is a commemoration of the Great War and, in particular, the 12,000 Australian lives lost in 
Belgium in 1917, of whom 6,000 have no known graves and are named on the Menin Gate Memorial in 
Ieper.
Work on the garden began in 2013, four years after the Flemish and Australian governments signed a 
Memorandum of Understanding for cooperation between Australia and Belgium to increase community 
understanding and recognition in their respective countries of their shared history of the twentieth 
century's World Wars.
The commemorative text of John McCrae’s poem “In Flanders fields” is inscribed atop the Garden’s low 
stone walls. The overlapping text is designed to encourage visitors to experience the garden from every 
aspect as they walk around it in commemorative reflection. Much of the soil in the garden has come from 
areas of Flanders: It was collected in 2015 and 2016 with the assistance of the Commonwealth War 
Graves Commission from the Tyne Cot Cemetery and many of the battlefields in which Australian 
soldiers fell. The soil was shipped to Australia for treatment in early 2017 before being mixed with 
Australian soil and added to the garden. It is within this soil that the poppies will continue to grow.
The Memorial gratefully acknowledges the support of the Flemish government, the Commonwealth War 
Graves Commission and the Australian Embassy to Belgium and Luxembourg and Mission to the 
European Union and NATO.

Animals in War (2009)
Figure 2.21 Animals in War memorial (Source: Australian War Memorial).
The Animals in War Memorial is a joint project between the Australian War Memorial and the Royal 
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA).
The memorial commemorates those animals that served alongside Australians in all conflicts. It 
recognises the practical and psychological roles animals have played during times of war and conflict. 
The Animals in War Memorial incorporates as its centrepiece a large bronze horse head, the only 
remaining fragment from the original Desert Mounted Corps memorial. The Desert Mounted Corps 
memorial was designed by Charles Web Gilbert, temporarily worked on by Paul Montford and completed 
by Sir Bertram Mackennal. It was installed in Port Said, Egypt and unveiled in 1932 by Australia's wartime 
Prime Minister Billy Hughes. In 1956 the Desert Mounted Corps memorial was destroyed by rioters 
during the Suez Crisis. The remaining fragments of this memorial were returned to Australia. A new 
memorial, made by Ray Ewers and modelled on the original Gilbert design, was installed and unveiled 
by Sir Robert Menzies at Albany, Western Australia in 1964. A version of this was also installed on 
ANZAC Parade, Canberra and unveiled by Prime Minister John Gorton in 1968.
Artist, Steven Holland, has positioned the bronze horse head upon a tear shaped plinth made of granite. 
The height of the plinth allows the memorial to be accessible, encouraging visitors to engage with the 
horse's head in the same way they might have a personal interaction with animals generally. The horse 
head is a poignant relic, rich in history, drama and emotion. It provides a tangible link to all animals and 
in this new setting is a sensitive and symbolic memorial for all animals that have served in war.
Future Memorials
The Site Development Plan (SDP) defines Memorial Placement Principles for the addition of new 
memorials across the site in the future.14

families of those who have served and serve today. Each of these sculptures is being developed in 
accordance with the SDP and in close co-ordination from the affected communities.
2.4.2 The Eastern Precinct
Between 2007 and 2014, the Memorial also undertook major works in the Eastern Precinct, to bring the 
Eastern Precinct up to the high design standard of the Western Precinct, whilst maintaining the informal 
woodland character, and visual relationship with Mount Ainslie. The works included the demolition of the 
Outpost café and construction of a new accessible cafe, Poppy’s; improved outdoor areas and facilities; 
a new forecourt area containing the National Service Memorial; and improved access and coach and 
visitor parking. The project won the Canberra Medallion, the highest award at the Australian Institute of 
Architects (AIA), ACT Chapter Awards, the Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture and the 
National Award for Urban Design at the National AIA Awards.
Memorials installed in the Eastern Precinct include the ‘Elevation of the Senses’ (2015) memorial.
Figure 2.22 Elevation of the Senses (Source: Australian War Memorial)
This sculpture commemorates the vital role and contribution of Explosive Detection Dogs and their 
handlers in war.
The tunnel through the base of the sculpture alludes to the rigorous training undertaken by the dogs, 
while the rocky outcrops atop the columns represent the foreign landscapes to which the dogs and their 
handlers are deployed. The elevation of the dog on the central column, where it crouches eye-to- eye 
with its handler, highlights the deep bonds that are forged between the two, as well as the mutual 
dependence on which their work is based. The configuration of the columns refers to the agility and 
obstacle courses undertaken by the dogs, as part of their training. Within the main column is a hidden 
cache of weapons, visible only from the back of the sculpture in order to illustrate the danger of buried

IEDs or hidden weapons that only the dogs can find with their heightened sense of smell. Sitting in the 
bag, which forms the smallest component of the sculpture, is a tennis ball. The tennis ball is an integral 
part of the dog’s training, as well as a valuable reward when the animal has located explosives. Ewen 
Coates (1965- ) is a Melbourne based sculptor and painter.
In 2020 an expansion of the underground parking facility beneath Poppy’s Café was completed as part 
of the enabling works preceding the Memorial’s Development Project. In addition to delivering an 
additional 123 permanent parking spaces for visitors the expansion also provides for additional bicycle 
storage and is plumbed to provide charging stations for electric bicycle and scooters in future.
During the major construction works period of the Development Project a temporary car park has been 
created on the upper level of the underground car park to the temporary increase in traffic associated 
with trade works. At the completion of the Project in 2028 this area will be returned to a native bushland 
state in keeping with the broader landscape heritage values of the Eastern Precinct.
Under the Memorial’s SDP this area is designated as a site for possible future expansion for collection 
services buildings and the new underground car park structure has been designed to accommodate a 
two storey building above ground if necessary.
2.5 Australian War Memorial Development Project 2019-2028
On 1 November 2018, the Australian Government approved, and committed funding for the Australian 
War Memorial (Development Project (the Project). This section includes text provided by the Memorial.
The scope of the Project is to construct additional exhibition spaces to enable the Memorial to continue 
to comply with the Australian War Memorial Act 1980; to equitably tell the stories of all Australian 
servicemen and women who have served overseas in conflicts and operations. This section provides 
additional information, prepared by the Memorial, on the background and development of the Project.
2.5.1 Project Development
In 2014 the Memorial identified, through its business planning process, the need to examine how it would 
tell the stories of recent and then ongoing service in wars and on peacekeeping and peacemaking 
operations. This was included as a priority in its 2014-17 Corporate Plan and research undertaken into 
possible ways to meet this need.
In 2017 the Memorial received funds under a New Policy Proposal to Government for an Initial Business 
Case (IBC) to examine this need.
The IBC was scoped to examine the following four key issues:
•
a lack of capacity to provide equitable coverage of conflicts and operations;
•
a lack of capacity to describe a broader description of war;
•
a lack of circulation space; and
•
poor accessibility and access.
2.5.2 Initial Business Case (2017)

27
Australian War Memorial—Heritage Management Plan—Revised Final Report, March 2022
The broad options were considered in five categories. Each of the solutions considered within each 
category was not a holistic approach to meet the need for the Project, but a measure that could contribute 
to a holistic solution. The five categories, including the base case option of “do nothing” were:
(a) Do Nothing
This is the current scenario and does not provide for any changes to be made to the function, buildings 
or operations of the Memorial at the Campbell site.
(b) Managed Based Approaches
Options to define solutions to the Memorial’s existing challenges through minor operational changes, 
without significant capital expenditure.
(c) Commercial and Leased Space
Options to consider the extent to which the existing constraints of the Memorial could be mitigated, either 
nearby to, or remote to, the Memorial, through the leasing of exhibition or storage space.
(d) Adaptive Reuse
Options to consider how the existing facilities at the Memorial might be adaptively re-used to allow for 
additional exhibition space. Allows for minimal capital works expenditure.
(e) Construction
Options to undertake capital works to reduce or eliminate the existing constraints on the Memorial.
Initial Business Case Options Analysis
Within each IBC category, except for the base case of ‘do nothing’, a more detailed series of options 
were examined.
(a) Management-based approaches assessed were:
i.
Restrictions on the number and timing of visitors;
ii.
Use of the Memorial’s Mitchell storage facility;
iii. Additional travelling exhibitions/relocatable satellite facility;
iv. Travelling exhibitions to state capital museums, memorials/shrines; and
v.
Travelling exhibitions to existing Defence museums.
(b) Commercial and leased space options assessed were:
i.
Lease Anzac Park East or West;
ii.
Offsite leased exhibition space; and
iii. Offsite leased storage, administration and back of house functions.
(c) Adaptive reuse options assessed were:
i.
Refurbishment of Campbell site;

ii.
Refurbishment of the Administration Building and Bean Building; and
iii. Refurbishment of the Mitchell site.
(d) Construction options assessed were:
i.
Initial redevelopment for the current requirement;
ii.
Staged redevelopment onsite for immediate critical constraints;
iii. Develop the precinct for the likely future requirements;
iv. Satellite facility at Anzac Park East and West;
v.
Alternative initial redevelopment for the current requirement;
vi. Satellite facilities in surrounding area (Goulburn, NSW; Fairbairn, ACT); and
vii. Satellite facilities in other States/Territories.
Initial Business Case—Conclusion
The conclusion of the IBC assessment was that in order for the Memorial to meet its obligations as 
defined in the Australian War Memorial Act 1980 and to meet the future needs of the Memorial there 
was a requirement to undertake construction and refurbishment of existing assets at the Memorial’s 
Campbell site.
This was primarily based on the requirement for the Memorial to maintain its social significance at the 
heart of national commemoration, and the belief that all Australian servicemen and women deserve to 
be commemorated equitably at the Memorial.
2.5.3 Detailed Business Case—Development of Options
As part of the Initial Business Case process the Australian government accepted the Memorial’s 
recommendation that the option that best met the need for the Project was the construction of additional 
gallery space on the main Memorial site at Campbell. This led to the development of a Detailed Business 
Case in 2018.
The Detailed Business Case commenced with the development of a User Requirements Brief which 
investigated and recorded the specific project requirements through a detailed analysis of each of the 
Memorial’s three functions. Concurrent with the development of the User Requirements Brief, detailed 
investigations into the conditions and constraints of both the existing buildings and the site were 
undertaken.
On completion of the User Requirements Brief and the site investigations, a Functional Design Brief was 
developed. The Functional Design Brief set down the specific functional and spatial requirements for the 
Project. This Functional Design Brief included an analysis of the conflicts and operations and the amount 
of space required to appropriately and equitably tell those stories.
The Functional Design Brief was approved by the Memorial Council which formed the basis of the Project 
cost and built outcomes proposed to Government as part of the Detailed Business Case submission. 
The Functional Design Brief also established the requirements to be delivered through the design 
process.

Design Outcome to be achieved through Detailed Business Case Stage
The design outcomes from the Detailed Business Case process were intended to identify the broad 
scope and develop, analyse, and assess locations for the additional space to be created for the Project.
Precinct Solution for Additional Gallery Space—Options Development
At the start of the design process, a four-day design charrette was conducted in which five senior 
architects and ten Memorial staff participated. As part of the design charrette, all possible options to 
create additional space to meet the User Requirements Brief were considered. The outcome of the four-
day charrette was that four design options were selected to be further developed. These were based 
primarily on four key variables being:
•
the location of a second entrance;
•
the location of new gallery space;
•
whether the Glazed Link was included; and
•
the location of the additional car parking.
There were a number of project elements that were consistent with all options such as the Main Building 
Refurbishment, Bean Building Refurbishment and Extension, and the construction of a Research Centre 
between the existing Bean Building and Poppy’s Café.
The four options and their key elements in summary are:
Option 1
Second Entrance
South underground 
New Gallery Space 
North underground 
Glazed Link
Yes
Additional Car Parking  Above ground to the north
Option 2

Project Elements Consistent Across all Options
The Main Building refurbishment, Bean Building refurbishment and extension, and the construction of a 
Research Centre between the existing Bean Building and Poppy’s Café were consistent in the 
development of all options, and therefore were not highlighted in the options selection. These elements

and how they interfaced with the options were considered as part of a holistic option that delivered the 
full Functional Design Brief.
Development Options Considered
Option 1 – Gallery Space Underground to the Immediate North of the Main Building
Option 1 included the following key locations of additional space:
•
Second Entrance
South underground
•
New Gallery Space
North underground
•
Glazed Link
Yes (between New Gallery Space and rear of Main Building)
•
Additional Car Parking
Above ground to the north
Option 1 originated as the JPW Masterplan 2017 and was amended to the assessed design solution 
through the early design process. The basis of this design was a desire to keep development on the site 
as compact and easy to navigate as possible, with new galleries close to the heart of the Main Building 
whilst maintaining the north-south axis.

Option 2 included the following key locations of additional space:
•
Second Entrance
South underground
•
New Gallery Space
East underground
•
Glazed Link
Yes
•
Additional Car Parking
Above ground to the north
The basis of this design option proposes a subterranean development of the site that is primarily below 
ground to the east of the Main Building. A southern entry is provided in a similar way to what is proposed 
in Option 1. The basis of the design was to test a fully subterranean option using the rising land to the 
east, therefore minimising visual impact across the site and maintaining the primacy of the Main Building. 
This provided galleries in close proximity to the Main Building, but on a parallel north- south axis rather 
than along the main north-south axis.

East underground (in existing car park)
•
New Gallery Space
North above ground
•

•
Second Entrance
West above ground
•
New Gallery Space
East underground (in existing car park)
•
Glazed Link
Yes
•
Additional Car Parking
Multi-level on existing western car park
The basis of this design option proposes the use of the underground car park space directly adjacent to 
the east of the Main Building as gallery space, and an alternative entry to the west of the Main Building 
that is related to a new above ground car park structure at the western end of the site. This option uses 
the fall of the land to the west to enable the top of the western extension to be set to the existing ground 
level of the existing underground car park to the east which results in the two sides of the Memorial being 
symmetrical as viewed from Anzac Parade

Assessment of the Options
Each of the four options was evaluated using a multi-criteria assessment to facilitate a comparable 
evaluation of each option. This approach was based on the following core principles that each option 
must satisfy the requirements of the Functional Design Brief. All options considered included an equal 
amount of additional gallery space, to enable a direct comparison between preliminary designs on the

the shortlisted options on its technical merits, financial impacts and capacity to support the Project 
objectives as follows:
•
Technical (30 per cent weighting)
•

Heritage was considered from a relative perspective with the aim of understanding and assessing how 
all options would impact physical and social heritage values. Overall Options 1 and 3 had the least above 
ground physical scale as Option 3 included a new entrance and gallery space both underground whilst 
retaining Anzac Hall, and Option 1 replaced Anzac Hall with a building of similar above-ground scale 
with a new second entrance underground as well. Options 3 and 4 had an increase in above ground 
structure with Option 3 including above ground space to the north to form an arc between the 
Administration Building and the Bean Building with Anzac Hall in the middle of the arc, and Option 4 
included a new Western Entrance pavilion at a similar distance from the Main Building as Poppy’s Café. 
Whilst physical scale is not itself a heritage assessment, it has a direct impact on the ability to manage 
the overall heritage outcomes. The specific comparisons of key heritage impacts are:
•
Views of the Building in-the-round
Three of the options included the Glazed Link which allowed a greater appreciation of the Main Building 
from the north, due to the immediately adjacent placement of occupied space. The option with the highest 
impact was Option 2 as it both prevented a clear view of the Main Building from Treloar Crescent due to 
the new gallery structures, and the absence of a Glazed Link meant the adjacent space would remain 
unoccupied by visitors. Option 4 shrouded a greater extent of the Main Building with the entry pavilion 
located to the west, although the link gallery between the western entry pavilion and the Main Building 
was below the lower level of the Main Building so the majority of the Main Building remained visible in-
the-round.
For the three options that included the Glazed Link, the intent was that the viewing in-the-round 
requirement would be met as the Main Building would be able to be viewed through the glazed walls 
from a distance, while benefiting from the immediate adjacent space being occupied by the public.
•
Parliament House View
All four options had minimal impact on the front of the Main Building; however, there were differing 
impacts from the south closer to the Memorial. Option 4 included a western entry pavilion, however due 
to the fall of the land this would not have been visible until a person was on the Main Building forecourt 
however, it did add to the built form along the line of the front of the Main Building.
•
Mount Ainslie Views
Option 2 will have the most significant impact on the Mount Ainslie views as it creates a ring of buildings 
along Treloar Crescent. Options 1, 3 and 4 will have a similar impact with the most significant impact 
across the options being the inclusion of the Glazed Link in the view from Mount Ainslie.

Impact on Anzac Hall
Anzac Hall was described in the Memorial’s Heritage Management Plan (2011) as a ‘modern, flexible 
exhibition hall of 3,000 square metres to display the AWM’s collection of large technology objects’. The 
design itself was commended for the manner in which it retained views of the Main Memorial Building ‘in 
the round’ and its ‘unobtrusive’ nature which ensure it did not overwhelm the Main Memorial Building.
The exhibitions in the hall consisted of four main areas with the first three opened to the public at the 
same time as the building itself: ‘Striking by night’, ‘Sydney under attack’, ‘Our first naval victory’, and 
‘The ANZAC Spirit’. These exhibitions were subsequently joined by the First World War aviation display 
‘Over the Western Front’.
In 2005, after the installation and display of the first three highly regarded exhibitions and four years after 
its completion, ANZAC Hall received the RAIA’s Sir Zelman Cowen Award for public buildings for design 
excellence.
Anzac Hall was also included as part of the Memorial’s formal heritage listings and noted for its 
contributions to the aesthetic values of the place and, particularly through its exhibitions, its contributions 
to the Memorial’s social significance and its connection to significant people and events in Australia’s 
history.
The importance of the ongoing heritage management of Anzac Hall, including its physical fabric and 
exhibitions, as part of the Memorial’s overall heritage management responsibilities was highlighted the 
Memorial’s Heritage Management Plan (2011).
These heritage values, and the policy of ensuring the presentation of Anzac Hall, were discussed 
extensively in the context of the proposed replacement of Anzac Hall through this options assessment 
process. In addition to heritage matters the potential environmental costs of the replacement of a 
relatively ‘young’ public building and in terms of heritage impacts also formed part of the assessment.
Option 1 was the only option which involved the demolition of Anzac Hall, however Option 2 would have 
materially impacted the architecture of Anzac Hall with connections to either side.
Despite the options assessment highlighting the greater heritage and environmental strengths of Options 
3 and 4 it was determined that Anzac Hall, designed in the 1990’s to display ‘Large Technology Objects’ 
in a ‘museum theatre’ environment focussing on the World Wars was not well suited to being expanded 
or modified to meet the established need of the Memorial to better tell the history of the large number of 
smaller scale peacekeeping, humanitarian and conflicts Australia had been involved in since 1975.
It was in this broader understanding of the Memorial’s heritage significance as it relates to social heritage 
values and the connection to significant people and events in Australia’s history, noting that the ongoing 
ability of the Memorial to tell significant stories is important, as well as its physical fabric, that the 
assessment concluded that Option 1, despite the replacement of Anzac Hall with a new purpose built 
structure, was the preferred option.
•
Risk to the Main Building Fabric
Options 1 and 3 proposed a second entrance into the Main Building at the lower level through an existing 
plant room under the current entry stairs. Whilst the entry was located under the Main Building, the risk 
was limited there is an existing plant room which creates a structural opening supported the entry into 
the building. Option 3 required a link into the lower level of the Main Building

at a number of points as well as excavation close to the Main Building along the eastern face. This was 
a substantial risk that was taken into consideration, noting works of this scale have been successfully 
undertaken in other heritage buildings.
•
Social Heritage Considerations
All four options proposed a solution which included a second entrance that connected to the lower level 
of the Main Building and would require a design outcome that maintained a strong link to the 
Commemorative Area. Option 1 provided the additional gallery space immediately to the north of the 
Main Building, and a new entrance immediately to the south while retaining the current geographical 
centre of the Memorial. The other options moved the geographical centre away from the Commemorative 
Area (Option 2 to the north, Option 3 to the east and Option 4 to the south). Option 1 also maintained 
the strong north-south visitor journey, whereas the remaining options created alternative visitor journeys. 
Option 2 also created a parallel axis that meant visitors could bypass the Main Building.
•
Overall Assessment

Option 1 was assessed as having a significant impact with the demolition of Anzac Hall, 
however the Memorial considered this option to be strong in other key heritage areas. Option 
1 was significantly stronger with regard to social heritage as it maintained the primacy of the 
Main Building, channelled all visitors through the centre of the Main Building and provided 
gallery space adjacent to the heart of the Memorial.

Option 3 was the best option for physical heritage as it had no above ground impacts except 
for the Glazed Link to the existing Anzac Hall.

Option 2 created an envelope around the north of the Main Building which impacted on the 
Main Building in-the-round.

Option 4 created an above ground interface with the Main Building which was assessed as 
having a significantly negative impact as it would also reduce the view of the Main Building in-
the-round.
Preferred Option
Option 1 was identified as the preferred option by the Memorial Executive, and was subsequently 
endorsed by the Memorial’s Council. The proposed options were not the final design outcomes but 
served as an indication of where the major additional space would be constructed. Option 1 was 
considered the only option that met all of the Project objectives. Option 1 was assessed as the highest-
ranked concept and provided the Memorial with a solution that:
•
delivered additional space as close as possible to the Hall of Memory to ensure all galleries were 
as close as possible to the heart of the Memorial and that all conflicts included in the new space 
were treated on an equitable basis;
•
provided the strongest social heritage outcomes with connectivity to the Commemorative Area as 
it channelled visitors through the Main Building;
•
delivered additional space in the most compact setting and close to the primary circulation 
network;
•
provided clear circulation flow to improve the visitor experience;

•
maintained the north-south axis and existing vista;
•
minimised above ground increase to the building footprint;
•
involved one low risk connection into the Main Building façade; and
•
enabled the construction of large flexible spaces in the New Anzac Hall that can accommodate 
Large Technology Objects as part of the galleries.
Options That Were Not Selected
Option 1 was considered to be the best overall outcome including heritage considerations. Whilst the 
other outcomes were not specifically rejected, simply rated lower than Option 1, there were clear reasons 
why they were not selected. A summary of the key reasons why each of the other options were 
considered less suitable than Option 1 are:
Option 2
•
This option was not selected. Whilst it left the front of the Memorial completely unchanged, it did 
not meet the brief as:

the visitor journey would have required visitors to travel across the Anzac Hall link bridge and 
then for over an additional 100 metres to either side. This was considered not reasonable for 
a visitor journey, particularly with the Memorial’s elderly demographic and therefore was 
assessed as low value for money;

the design solution that “enveloped” the Main Building would have made the Memorial feel 
enclosed, prevented seeing the building in-the-round from some northern vantages and 
prevented the feel of the Memorial being connected with Mount Ainslie;

the Memorial would feel disconnected with the geographic centre of the Memorial moved to 
the north. This would detract from the primacy of the Commemorative Area;

those conflicts represented in the galleries at the extremity of the extension to Anzac Hall, 
which would likely be visited less than the existing galleries, would be considered less 
importance that those in the Main Building; and

due to the spread out nature of the facility there would be a requirements for significantly more 
staff, operating costs and the need for an emergency and functional entrance to the rear.
Option 3
•
This option was not selected. Whilst it had minimal above ground impact, it did not meet the 
brief for several reasons:

to achieve connectivity to the Main Building and be functional for the Memorial to operate there 
was a requirement to have connections at a number of places to the lower level of the Main 
Building. This posed a risk to the fabric of the lower level of the Main Building;

the option created a parallel path to the Main Building to the east which would have moved the 
geographic centre and drawn visitors away from the Commemorative Area and created a 
potentially confusing wayfinding approach; and


was significantly more expensive than the other options.
Option 4
•
This option was not selected as the Memorial Council had a major concern with the entry pavilion 
in the western courtyard. Whilst the entry pavilion could not be seen from the Parliament House 
Vista due to the earth berm to the west of the Parade Ground, the Council was concerned with 
the disruption to the southern area of the Memorial and western garden. They considered this had 
a major impact on Objective 1—Maintain the Memorial’s National Significance and agreed that 
this option should not be considered. The additional technical concerns were that the design:

created an east-west journey that conflicted with the Main Building north-south visitor journey 
and would therefore have created a confusing visitor path;

the new entrance pavilion was a considerable distance from the traditional entrance and 
provided no opportunity to integrate the two entrances; and

as less than 50% of visitors currently visit Anzac Hall, the additional southern galleries would 
have focussed more visitors away from Anzac Hall reducing the value of that asset.
2.5.4 Design Development
On 3 July 2018 the Memorial’s Council decided Option 1 was to be developed to submit to Government, 
acknowledging that this was not the final design but rather indicated the broad project components and 
outcomes to deliver the Project. Option 1 included the following key locations of additional space:
•
second entrance: south underground (now to be described as “New Southern Entrance”, as the 
existing entrance to the south of the upper level of the Main Building will remain);
•
new gallery space: north underground (now to be described as “New Anzac Hall”, as the existing 
Anzac Hall will be replaced);
•
glazed link: between new gallery space and rear of Main Building (now to be described as “Glazed 
Link”);
•
additional car parking: above ground to the north of Treloar Crescent;
•
Main Building Refurbishment;
•
Bean Building Refurbishment;
•
Bean Building Extension;
•
Research Centre;
•
revised Parade Ground layout; and
•
Public Realm works.

Development of Options Stage 2—Detailed Design
Combination of Anzac Hall and Glazed Link
As the design of Anzac Hall and the Glazed Link were to be an integrated solution, it was considered 
appropriate that they were joined for the purposes of the design process.
New Anzac Hall/Glazed Link and New Southern Entrance Design Competition Process
The Memorial considered that the appropriate approach for the second entrance and the additional 
gallery space was to undertake two design competitions for these elements. The competition jury (both 
projects) included three eminent architects and two Memorial staff. The chair of the jury was Professor 
Daryl Le Grew AO, former Vice Chancellor of the University of Tasmania and included Professor Richard 
Marshall, formerly a Harvard University professor, now a Director at Wills Perkins, a major US 
architectural practice. The competition jury was supported by a heritage conservation architect, the 
Project’s design manager, a probity lawyer and a quantity surveyor who each provided specialist advice 
on key performance outcomes of each of the competition entries.
Competition Assessment Criteria
The assessment criteria issued to the competitors and the competition jury were:
•
Innovation;
•
Integration;
•
Connectivity and Circulation;
•
Heritage;
•
Capacity and Sensitivity;
•
Sustainability and Climatic Response;
•
Respectful and Dignified Visual Impact;
•
Integration into the Main Building; and
•
Functional Outcomes.
Selected Design–New Anzac Hall and Glazed Link
There were three entries that proposed the replacement of the existing Anzac Hall and one that proposed 
a solution that retained Anzac Hall through proposing extensions to either side of the existing building.
Whilst only the latter responded directly to the heritage values of Anzac Hall and specific conservation 
policies on the treatment of Anzac Hall in the 2011 Heritage Management Plan, each entry took clear 
account of the Memorial’s broader heritage imperatives and the heritage management principles laid out 
in the Heritage Management Plan as required by the tender process and met or exceeded minimum 
requirements relating to this assessment criteria.
The competition entry from Cox Architecture was one of the three that replaced Anzac Hall and was 
judged as the winning design as it was considered to have strongly met all of the assessment criteria. 
The winning design as further developed through to concept design is included in Figure 2.27.

The competition jury statement on the winning design is as follows:
This scheme was found by the jury to have a strong overall design approach that met both the 
functional brief as well as the aesthetic requirements. The jury was impressed by the way the 
design places the new spaces as well as the Main Building within a broader campus/precinct with 
a distinct identity and purpose that is itself sympathetically placed in the natural and built 
landscapes.
Jurors found this design had good integration and was able to create a sympathetic and effective 
intermediary space (the Glazed Link) between the Main Building and the New Anzac Hall design. 
The materiality of the design was also appreciated as contributing strongly to creating a cohesive 
feel between the three spaces and jurors noted the design and materials would both age well.
The scheme creates very flexible and usable exhibition spaces and additionally supports other 
operational requirements such as events well. The column-free design on multiple levels was 
noted to provide high levels of adaptability for the future, although concerns were expressed 
around the structural requirements, and related costs, to achieve this.
Selected Design—New Southern Entrance
The competition entry from Scott Carver Architects was judged as the winning design for the New 
Southern Entrance as it was considered to have strongly met all the assessment criteria. The winning 
design as further developed through to concept design is included in Figure 2.28.

Figure 2.28 New Southern Entrance Render (Source: Scott Carver).
The competition jury statement on the winning design is as follows:
The jury commended this scheme for its aesthetic approach, well thought out environmentally 
sustainable development plan and its very clear access and circulation plans – in particular a 
series of artistic/commemorative attractors to draw people to the very clear entrance areas.
The Jury appreciated the intent of this design to be subservient to the Main Building and to not 
establish its own separate identity. The use of a glass oculus structure to provide a clear and 
evocative view of the Main Building above the visitor upon arrival at the Southern Hall entry 
added a strong, innovative element to this design and demonstrated its intent to pay appropriate 
homage to the Commemorative Area and Hall of Memory in particular. The internal design was 
also viewed as high quality and fitting for an iconic building of the Memorial’s nature.
Connectivity was highly rated by the jury and the creation of entry plazas provided clear, 
controllable points of arrival imbued with a sense of peace and reverence appropriate for the 
Memorial. Importantly the plazas, in particular the eastern, presented as very usable as waiting 
areas prior to an event or opening times and offered visitors a commemorative or artistic 
experience to occupy them whilst also providing shade and shelter from the weather.
The distinction between east and west arrival sequences also received praise from the jurors with 
each plaza offering a unique experience and enhancing the value of multiple visits to the site. The 
use of landscape and built architecture to draw visitors into these plazas naturally whilst not 
obscuring or limiting access to the original entrance was also noted.
2.5.5 The Replacement of Anzac Hall 
Precinct Spatial Solution
The exercise to determine the most appropriate precinct spatial solution through the Detailed Business 
Case process thoroughly evaluated the options for additional gallery space that could be connected to 
the Main Building whilst having minimal impact on the Parliament House Vista. The only solution that 
would maintain the strong relationship with the Commemorative Area and provide the space to tell the

needs to be constructed on the site of the existing Anzac Hall is the same reason the decision was made 
to locate the existing Anzac Hall at that location when it was first constructed. It is the only above ground 
area in close proximity to the Main Building that does not interrupt the Parliament House Vista.
Why the retention solution was not selected
The Design Competition guidelines for Anzac Hall and the Glazed Link, detailed by the Memorial, offered 
the opportunity to the shortlisted architectural firms to develop a design that retained Anzac Hall, and 
indeed one competitor, a highly regarded architectural practice, did propose a solution that retained 
Anzac Hall. Extensive analysis of the design revealed that this option did not meet the brief, specifically 
in relation to the display and relocation of Large Technology Objects to provide the Memorial flexibility 
to renew galleries for the future.
With the current Anzac Hall there is considerable difficulty relocating medium and large sized objects. 
The solution proposed in the Design Competition entry that retained the current Anzac Hall involved 
enclosing the only door to Anzac Hall and using alternative approaches through a series of relatively 
small spaces. A key design objective was for flexibility well into the future.
Whilst the existing Anzac Hall is listed in the heritage values, the design did not include a strategy for 
how the Memorial could be expanded when required, as it was a highly bespoke building that limited 
any opportunity to be functionally extended. Anzac Hall is likely to have a life of 80-100 years, however 
galleries will undergo major changes every 15-20 years and this Project needs to deliver a design 
solution that can be adapted for a significant range of future scenarios. The Jury determined that the 
solution that retained Anzac Hall did not meet the design requirements. The Jury noted in its comments:
The jury commended this entry for its intent to retain as much of the original Anzac Hall design as 
possible and noted that it was perhaps the most visually appealing design. Jurors noted however 
that this commitment to retaining the existing building ultimately constrained the design in the 
same way as Anzac Hall itself has been constrained. Thus the design failed to provide a suitably 
flexible exhibition space and would likely not be able to grow with the passage of time to 
accommodate new and changing displays.
Integration was rated highly by the jury, noting that the design connected to external plazas to 
create clever outside spaces around the atrium area in particular. It was noted these spaces had 
great potential for securitisation and programmatical use. The design intent of ensuring visitors 
were visually connected to the Main Building and especially Hall of Memory at multiple points 
was particularly admired by the panel.
This same design however reduced practicable display space, the ability to move Large Technology 
Projects in/out of spaces and would likely result in the need for the physical building design to drive 
exhibition design and the visitor journey/flow/experience and therefore would unsustainably 
constrain future options.
Overall the jury noted the design was architecturally and aesthetically pleasing but lacked the 
required flexibility and logistical capacity to support exhibitions needs over the proposed 50-100 
year lifespan of the building.

2.5.6 Project Development Outcomes
The Project as scoped will deliver the following outcomes for inclusion in future HMP updates:
•
total new space in the Anzac Hall and Glazed Link of 13,995 square metres consisting of:

lower gallery area of 2,964 square metres;

main level gallery area of 3,448 square metres;

mezzanine gallery and viewing area of 465 square metres;

Glazed Link public space of 2,176 square metres; and

respite areas, amenities, circulation, back of house support and plant across all levels of 
4,943 square metres.
•
total new space for the New Southern Entrance consisting of public entrance and cloaking, 
bookshop, theatre and function room, flexible gallery and plant of 3,450 square metres;
•
total new space for the Bean Building Extension and Research Centre, archive and collection 
support functions of 7,299 square metres;
•
total refurbished space in the existing Bean Building of 2,944 square metres; (Note: Approval for 
the internal refurbishment works is not included in this submission);
•
the Main Building refurbishment of galleries, educational functions and enhanced circulation is 
subject to a later heritage process that is likely to commence in 2024 with refurbishment works to 
commence in mid-2024. Internal refurbishment works at the connection of the New Southern

Entrance to the Main Building will occur in the first instance, with further refurbishment to occur 
at a later date, as a separate project with further development approvals;
•
an extension to the underground car park in the eastern precinct under Poppy’s Café to provide 
an additional 123 permanent car parks (this was varied from the Detailed Business Case solution 
to reduce the impact of an above ground car park on Remembrance Park);
•
reshape the Parade Ground to return it to its original rectangular shape and improve the terraced 
seating and accessibility for visitors in wheelchairs; and
•
improvements to the Public Realm with a focus on providing safe and pedestrian paths from the 
car parking and bus parking through to the Memorial visitor and education program entrances that 
are compliant with the Disability Discrimination Act 2000.
2.5.7 Community Response to the Development Project and Designs
As with any major project, and particularly one involving one of Australia’s most prominent national 
cultural institutions, there was considerable community interest in both the project and the designs put 
forward by the Memorial.
As part of approvals processes these proposals were subject to considerable scrutiny and extensive 
public comment between 2018 and 2021. This included multiple opportunities for the Australian public 
to comment on the project, design decisions and design outcomes through public meetings, surveys, 
email and formal public comment processes. By the end of 2021 more than 7,000 responses had been 
received through these processes, one of the largest public outreach efforts associated with a Canberra 
based development in years.
Whilst the majority of commenters supported both the need for the project and the design outcomes, a 
section of community submissions received were opposed to both. The replacement of Anzac Hall and 
the potential change to the arrival sequence created by the New Southern Entrance were both of special 
concern within the heritage management and architectural communities.
Notably, in 2020 both the Australian Institute of Architects and the Australian Heritage Council made 
clear their opposition to the demolition of Anzac Hall in public, both as an award-winning exemplar of 
contemporary architecture and on environmental grounds, the latter especially given the building was 
only 20 years old, through public comment on the EPBC Act assessment of the project in 2019-20.
The Institute also conducted a social awareness campaign through its website and social media called 
‘Hands Off Anzac Hall’ seeking to rally community sentiment to prevent the replacement of Anzac Hall. 
This campaign was paralleled by a lively debate in the media—especially in the ACT—about the project 
broadly and especially the replacement of Anzac Hall.
It was the key objective for the Australian War Memorial Council to fulfil the requirements of a detailed 
and carefully considered brief, to ensure that the vision and operational objectives of the Memorial are 
met. The Australian War Memorial Council considered that the retention of Anzac Hall would 
compromise this realisation of the vision and effective operation of the AWM.
2.5.8 Closure and demolition of Anzac Hall
In March 2021 the Memorial closed Anzac Hall to the public and commenced the removal of the 
exhibitions that had been hosted in Anzac Hall since its opening. This work was completed in June 2021 
with the transport of the Second World War Lancaster ‘G for George’ to the Memorial’s Treloar

Technology Centre and the donation of large sections of the associated exhibitions furniture to other 
museums.
The four major exhibitions previously hosted in Anzac Hall will return to display, updated and with key 
objects having undergone significant conservation to enable further long-term display periods, as part of 
the development project, some in the New Anzac Hall and others elsewhere in the Memorial’s galleries, 
by the time the project is completed in 2028.
In July 2021, with all approvals in place, demolition of the 2001 Anzac Hall commenced, prior to the 
finalisation of this HMP. The demolition work was completed by late September that year with more than 
90% of the structural steel and concrete components from the building being recycled.

3.0 Understanding the Place—Physical Context
This section provides a description of the physical fabric of the AWM.
3.1 Topographic Context
The AWM lies on the lower southwest-facing basal slopes of the Mount Ainslie and Mount Pleasant 
ridgeline water catchment. An unnamed tributary that drained into the Molonglo River (now Lake Burley 
Griffin) is located along the eastern boundary of the site.
The bedrock geology of the area is dominated by the Ainslie volcanics, which consist of Devonian rocks 
including rhyolite, dacite, tuff, and quartz porphyry.1 Soils within the area typically include red earths and 
red and yellow podzolic soils. Massive earths of a red or brown colour occur on the fan deposits flanking 
Mount Ainslie.2
The area is characterised by a constructed, undulating landscape where extensive landscaping and 
modification has subsumed the original landscape topography. Vegetation at the AWM site largely 
represents cultural plantings since the 1940s. The native vegetation is discussed further in Section 
3.2.10.
3.2 Physical Description
The AWM is located at the northern end of the land axis, the major planning axis that runs from 
Parliament House on Capital Hill through Federation Mall and Parkes Place and along Anzac Parade to 
Mount Ainslie (refer to Figure 3.1). The AWM has an elevated position at the end of Anzac Parade and 
is framed by Mount Ainslie in the background (refer to Figure 3.2).
The immediate site of the AWM is the area bounded by Limestone Avenue, Fairbairn Avenue and Treloar 
Crescent. The AWM is part of a larger landscape structured by the land axis and includes Anzac Park 
and Anzac Parade, as well as the Remembrance Nature Park on the slopes of Mount Ainslie behind the 
AWM. The AWM and Anzac Parade form part of the Parliament House Vista and are visually linked to 
the nearby Reid Conservation Area (refer to Figure 3.3). The AWM is associated with the many 
memorials that line Anzac Parade and commemorate specific aspects of Australia’s involvement in 
various theatres of international conflict.
Individual elements that comprise the AWM are briefly described below and are shown in Figure 3.4. 
Detailed descriptions, location maps and plans of the different elements of the place briefly outlined 
below are to be found in the Heritage Register and are to be used in conjunction with this HMP. The 
Heritage Register also contains a full list of the awards the Memorial has received recognising the 
creative and technical achievement of the AWM.
At the time of drafting this plan September 2018–June 2021, a project to expand the AWM is scheduled 
to commence. The development project will result in changes to the physical layout and features of the 
site, including internally in galleries and visitor amenity spaces, and externally with the creation of a new 
iteration of Anzac Hall, a glazed link between the new Anzac Hall and the main Memorial Building, a new 
Research Centre, the Parade Ground and the surrounding landscape. The physical descriptions in this 
section respond to the site before the development project commenced, and may change as the site 
undergoes development.

 The Main Memorial Building
The main Memorial building was designed with reference to the 
Art Deco style and displays Byzantine and Egyptian motifs in its 
modelling with interpenetrating masses and pylons marking the 
front entrance (refer to Figure 3.6). Egyptian architectural motifs 
were popular during the nineteenth century for monuments, 
memorials and mausoleums. During the twentieth century, 
aspects of the style merged with the Art Deco and were 
regarded as Moderne. The adoption of this style for the building 
reflected CEW Bean’s desire for the building to be at once 
museum, monument, memorial, temple and shrine. The long, 
low, plain lines and dome of the structure did not reflect 
classical architectural traditions but rather the great monuments 
of the east (refer to Figure 3.7). The use of face sandstone block 
for the building’s exterior is also important in evoking the 
monumentality 
and 
longevity 
suggested 
by 
Egyptian 
architecture. The Art Deco features displayed by the building 
include the strong horizontals of the stepped skyline contrasted 
with the vertical features of a centralised tower, monumental 
entrance and a concentration of ornamentation on the upper 
part of the building.
 The Commemorative Area
The Commemorative Area, including the Hall of Memory, is 
located in the core of the main Memorial building, immediately 
within the main entrance on the southern façade.
Visitors enter directly into the Commemorative Area from the 
building’s public entry on its main, south façade, passing 
through a small vestibule, flanked by the Menin Gate lions. 
Symbolically, the entrance commands the grand vista of 
Griffin’s land axis, directly connecting with Parliament House. 
All visitors to the Memorial enter through the Commemorative 
Area, providing a solemn introduction to the place as not only a 
museum, but also the national memorial to Australia’s war dead.

Changes to this area were carried out between 2012 and 
2017 as part of the First World War Centenary 
commemorative project. These included conservation and 
maintenance works, such as re-grouting the Pool of 
Reflection, and replacement of the bronze bracket for the 
eternal flame. Other works relating to visitor experience 
include the introduction of accessible ramp access from the 
main entry, additional lighting of the courtyard, a 
soundscape within the Roll of Honour and WiFi.
Courtyard and Roll of Honour
The entrance to the main Memorial building, with a low 
pyloned arch, provides a dramatic introduction to the central 
cloistered space (refer to Figure 3.8). At the centre of the 
courtyard is the Pool of Reflection, reinforcing the axial 
space, with steps at its northern end leading up to the Hall of 
Memory (refer to Figure 3.9 ). The arched cloisters line the 
courtyard and behind them lies the broad expanses of the 
Roll of Honour (refer to Figure 3.11). The Roll of Honour 
contains the names of over 102,000 Australians killed in war 
between the Sudan War in 1885 to Afghanistan in the 
2000s. Each cloistered bay around the commemorative area 
is marked with bronze letters naming 34 theatres of war; 15 
on the eastern cloister, 15 on the western cloister and 4 on 
the southern wall, in which Australians have been involved.
In 1977, a perceived need to soften the austere appearance 
of the stone courtyard resulted in the introduction of 
plantings in newly constructed planting boxes. The rosemary 
and pencil pines used in the courtyard are symbolically 
associated with remembrance and sacrifice. These planters 
were replaced and waterproofed during conservation works 
between 2012 and 2017.
Carved Stone Figures
Twenty-six Wondabyne sandstone carved figures adorn the 
main courtyard of the Commemorative Area (refer to Figure 
3.12). They were designed by Leslie Bowles, who produced 
plaster models for the figures. These models were used as 
a guide by the sculptor, W Swan, who carved them in situ 
during the construction of the AWM in 1940. All but one of 
the plaster models remain in the Memorial’s collection.
The carved stone figures depict various Australian fauna and 
Australian Indigenous people and were designed to

provide the drainage for the balconies around the courtyard. 
On the western side of the courtyard are an Indigenous 
female, kangaroo, wombat, bush turkey, frog, Tasmanian 
devil, cockatoo, mopoke, carpet snake, kookaburra, bearded 
dragon, dingo and a gurnet. The eastern side features an 
Indigenous male, emu, koala, platypus, tawny frogmouth, 
cuscus, swan, frilled-neck lizard, cassowary, thorny 
(mountain) devil, eagle, opossum and a goanna.
Due to the nature and composition of the Wondabyne 
sandstone, 
the 
carved 
figures 
suffered 
extensive 
deterioration due to weathering and were replaced during 
major conservation works to the Commemorative Area 
between 2012 and 2017. The original decaying stonework 
was removed and copies were carved for reinstatement.
Hall of Memory
The Hall of Memory, with its stepped cubic forms and copper 
dome, is the central architectural and landmark element of 
the place. As the major vertical element in the architectural 
composition, it closes the view from the courtyard and is a 
prominent terminating feature of the land axis. The mosaics 
in the hall are believed to be the largest in Australia.3 The 
style is essentially Art Deco, but with classical and Byzantine 
allusions and references. The human figures depicted in the 
mosaics represent qualities of strength and endurance. The 
theme of the dome decoration is the ascent of the spirits of 
the fallen. The cornice is crowned with a classical wreath and 
a flight of black swans symbolises the air. The Hall of Memory 
was Napier Waller’s largest public work and remains his most 
accessible.
Since 1993, when the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier 
was installed (refer to Figure 3.14), the Hall has also contained 
the sculpture known as the four pillars, designed by Janet 
Laurence, which replaced Ewer’s Australian Serviceman, now 
located in the Sculpture Garden. The pillars recall the four 
Platonic elements of earth, fire, air and water. The earth pillar 
is made of marble, the fire pillar of metal, the water pillar of 
glass and the polished wooden pillar represents the air. The 
four 11-metre-tall freestanding pillars are placed in the niche 
behind the Tomb, each symmetrical with the mosaic-clad 
mullions of the three major stained glass windows (refer to 
Figure 3.15). The purity and simplicity of their form contrasts 
with and confirms the rich detail of the glass and mosaic.

 The Galleries
The AWM galleries are located on the ground and lower 
levels of the main Memorial building, surrounding the central 
Commemorative Area. Galleries are also located within 
ANZAC Hall, discussed further below, which is a recent 
addition to the rear of the main Memorial building, joined to it 
by a walkway (refer to Figure 3.16).
The galleries and displays which exhibit the Memorial’s 
collection to the public form a key aspect of the AWM. The 
galleries consist of a series of exhibition spaces which have 
been extensively remodeled several times in the history of the 
building, reflecting the expanding requirements of the 
collection and the need to interpret Australia’s role in conflicts 
and peace-keeping missions.
Currently the galleries include:
•
the First World War areas, including the Sinai and 
Palestine Gallery—ground level in the west transept;
•
the Second World War areas—ground level in the east 
transept;
•
an Orientation Gallery—ground level at the western

First World War and Second World War 
Galleries
The First and Second World War Galleries are some of the 
earliest spaces at the AWM, dating from its construction 
period in the 1930s and 1940s. The original gallery layout of 
the main Memorial building consisted of four interconnected 
galleries with a continuous skylight running the full length. This 
was later covered over to protect objects on display. 
Subsequent to the opening of the AWM in 1941, there have 
been several alterations to the configuration and content of 
these exhibitions, including the additional transept wings in 
1968–1971. Between 1996 and 1999 the Memorial undertook 
redevelopment of the Second World War Galleries as part of 
the 
Gallery 
Development 
One. 
This 
included 
the 
redevelopment of the Orientation Gallery, introduction of a 
cloverleaf layout introduced for ease of gallery navigation, and 
the construction of a central lift and staircase to the galleries.
In 2014 the First World War Gallery was redeveloped as part 
of the commemoration of the First World War Centenary. 
These works transformed the historical arrangement by 
theatres of war—the Gallipoli Gallery, the Sinai Palestine 
Gallery and the Western Front Gallery—to depict the events 
of World War I in a chronological circulation. Other works 
included upgrades to the building infrastructure such as the 
relocation of fire stairs, and installation of new electrical and 
IT services for the new exhibitions. Original fabric, including 
ceilings, skylights, and flooring, was retained and conserved 
as part of the works.
Sinai and Palestine Gallery
The Sinai and Palestine Gallery, in the First World War area, 
is the only AWM gallery that retains its original 1940s function, 
and a number of exhibition and architectural features. The 
original coffered panelled ceiling and marbled rubber tiles 
remain but the tiles have been covered by parquetry flooring.4 
This gallery displays the Transportation of Supplies in the 
Desert Campaign 1914–1918 series of nine dioramas in its 
original location, the only set of dioramas to remain in their 
original location. Even though the First World War Galleries 
have been refurbished and upgraded, the contrast between 
the more traditional museum displays,

such as the Sinai and Palestine Gallery, and the 
contemporary displays, such as that in ANZAC Hall, 
provides a depth and sense of the historical development of 
the place for the visitor.
Hall of Valour
Located directly below the Hall of Memory, the Hall of Valour 
honours the 100 Australian recipients of the Victoria Cross 
and ten recipients of the George Cross. Adjacent to the Hall 
of Valour, the Shellal Mosaic is located within the original 
external wall of the building where it was installed at the 
opening of the AWM in 1941. The mosaic is the remains of 
an early Byzantine church floor dating from 561–562 CE, 
uncovered by Australian soldiers during the second Battle of 
Gaza.
Conflicts 1945 to Today Galleries
In 2007/08 the Conflicts 1945 to Today Galleries were 
created as part of Gallery Development Two. Located in the 
original Tank Gallery, part of the Reading Room and the 
1986 on the lower level, the spaces were extensively 
remodelled, including the creation of the glass walkway 
linking to the bridge of the HMAS Brisbane.
The first major redevelopment of the Conflicts 1945 to Today 
took place in 2016 with the creation of new displays relating 
to conflicts in the Middle East from the First Gulf War to 
Afghanistan.
In addition to the Middle East Galleries, a new exhibition 
called ‘Afghanistan: the Australian Story’ was opened in an 
area formerly part of the original Library and Research 
Centre.

Research Centre
The Research Centre on the lower level is located in the 
original library. This area has been reduced in size as part of 
previous changes to the configuration and function of spaces. 
The Research Centre on the lower level reveals the structure 
and architecture of the building and early features, unlike the 
more elaborately decorated (and redecorated) gallery spaces. 
Some space in this area has been altered for the creation of 
the Afghanistan exhibition.
Other Galleries and Spaces
The Aircraft Hall, Special Exhibitions Gallery and Orientation 
Gallery were all redeveloped, or installed between 1996 and 
1999 as part of Gallery Development One. The Discovery 
Zone, a hands-on education centre, was created as part of 
Gallery Development Two.
The main Memorial building also contains a number of 
circulation spaces that are used for display, primarily 
photographs, artwork, and in the western corridor, the ‘As of 
Today’ sculptural monument.
The Museum shop is located near the main entry on the 
ground level. The lower floor also contains a theatre, staff 
offices, collection and records storage, and plant.
 The Dioramas
The Memorial prides itself on its collection of dioramas, which 
have been an important feature of its exhibition galleries since 
its opening in 1941. Dioramas, or ‘picture models’ as they 
were first called, were suggested to CEW Bean by the official 
war artist Will Dyson as a suitable method for presenting the 
subject of war at the planned Australian War Museum (as the 
AWM was then to be called).5 Three sculptors and an artist 
were commissioned as early as 1918 to begin work on the 
project, which took more than 10 years to complete. It is 
evident that Bean saw the dioramas as integral to the purpose 
and function of the planned war museum.6 While the AWM’s 
later dioramas are generally considered less artistically 
successful than its outstanding First World War collection 
(with the probable exception of the Kapyong diorama in the 
Conflicts 1945 to Today Galleries), the creation and display of 
dioramas is still a well-known feature of the AWM today.

The 
dioramas, 
constructed 
between 1918 and 1983, are 
made from traditional materials 
of hessian, plaster, timber and 
lead.7 
The 
dioramas 
are 
generally robustly constructed 
and, as the First World War 
dioramas were constructed prior to the completion of the 
main Memorial building, they were designed to be movable. 
The dioramas’ curved backgrounds, some of which measure 
16 by 8 metres, are more fragile than the model bases. 
Three types of background construction are used in the 
dioramas: 
terracotta 
brickwork, 
timber 
framing 
and 
fibreglass. The earliest form of terracotta brickwork has 
since been replaced with a fibrous plaster skin which 
expands and contracts without cracking.8 Restored and new 
dioramas have been created on virtual backgrounds, which 
allows for changes according to the time of day. The majority 
of dioramas on display at the AWM are located in the First 
World War and the Second World War Galleries. 
Redevelopment of the First World War Gallery included the 
restoration and reinstatement of a number of historic 
dioramas, with restored or recreated backgrounds. New 
dioramas were also added to the Conflicts 1945 to Today 
Galleries, including the Battle of Kapyong diorama. This 
scene represents a specific moment and location that took 
place on 23–24 April 1951. The topography and individuals 
represented in the diorama are based on research of the 
area and Australian infantrymen of 3RAR. Other dioramas 
not on display are stored in the Memorial’s storage facility 
located at the AWM Mitchell Precinct.
 ANZAC Hall
In 2001 the ANZAC Hall addition, to the rear of the main 
Memorial building, was completed for the display of the 
collection’s large technology items. The addition was 
carefully designed by award-winning architectural firm 
Denton Corker Marshall to sit comfortably within the 
immediate vicinity of the original building. The large structure 
is excavated into the rising site so that it sits below the bulk 
of the main Memorial building and is separated from the 
building.
A large blank façade addresses the rear of the main 
Memorial building, punctuated only by the simple glass link 
bridge. The structure’s curved roof falls away from this blade 
wall and the main space fans out from it, to provide an open 
3,098 square metres of exhibition space and a maximum 
height of 10 metres. There are few external openings, 
except for the narrow verticals of the punched

openings to the raised platform of the outdoor café, on the 
eastern elevation. With battered walls and a curved turret roof 
design, the structure evokes a battleship. This is reinforced 
by the external cladding of deep grey metal panels forming a 
neutral backdrop to the rich texture of the sandstone facing of 
the original. Exhibitions in ANZAC Hall make extensive use 
of ‘object theatre’, where sound and lighting are used in 
innovative ways, and the objects themselves become 
screens to tell stories of Australia’s military history. The 
exhibition consists of four main areas: ‘Striking by night’, 
‘Sydney under attack’, ‘Our first naval victory’, and ‘Over the 
Front’.
ANZAC Hall was built on the site of previous carparking for 
visitors and staff. As a result, a new carpark was constructed.
 The Administration Building
This was the first significant additional structure to be added 
to the AWM in 1988, when the administrative functions were 
moved into this new, three-level office building, designed by 
Denton Corker Marshall. The building is designed in a well- 
mannered Postmodern style, representative of military 
fortifications. It is a rectangular structure, set back from the 
main Memorial building. The external stone facing is 
reminiscent of the sandstone on the original building, as are 
the punched window openings and the overall horizontality of 
the massing. Internally, the building is highly finished with 
recessed lighting, highly polished black marble tiles and a 
recurring cubic motif that can be seen as typical of the period 
in its design, appearing in the balustrades, windows, doors 
and carpets. The building is planned around a planted internal 
courtyard.
 CEW Bean Building
The CEW Bean Building, also designed by Denton Corker 
Marshall Architects, was completed in March 2006. The 
design, location and external finishes are compatible with the 
other AWM buildings. The building comprises a simple 
masonry flat-roofed block, embedded into the landscape 
behind a stone embankment. Narrow horizontal openings 
address the main Memorial building to the west, while the 
entrance is located on the eastern elevation, obscured from 
the main public spaces. The building is connected to the main 
Memorial building by an underground tunnel. Due to the 
topography, most of the lower storey is below ground level. 
The building’s parapet height aligns with the main mid-

level parapet of the AWM building. It is set back nine metres 
from the existing road kerb, adjacent to the stone 
embankment. The building houses paper-based collections, 
facilities for the photographic laboratories, a workshop and 
staff facilities. The tunnel allows for the safe movement of 
collections. Despite this connection, the CEW Bean Building 
is not considered to form part of the main Memorial building, 
although the construction of the CEW Bean Building was an 
essential precursor to Gallery Development Two.
 The Landscape
The AWM in the Landscape of Central 
Canberra
The AWM is located at the northern end of the land axis, the 
major planning axis which runs from Parliament House on 
Capital Hill, through Federation Mall and Parkes Place, along 
Anzac Parade to Mount Ainslie. The AWM has an elevated 
position at the end of Anzac Parade and is framed by Mount 
Ainslie in the background. The AWM is part of a larger 
landscape setting which is structured by the land axis and 
includes Anzac Parade, as well as the Remembrance Nature 
Park on the slopes of Mount Ainslie behind the place. The 
success of the AWM as a landmark is due in part to its 
distinctive massing and symmetry; its relative visual isolation 
given its privileged site on the land axis; the landscaped 
grounds and the backdrop of the forested slopes of Mount 
Ainslie. The role of the AWM as a national icon is reinforced 
by its central location in the Central National Area and on the 
land axis.

The Parade Ground and 
Central Precinct
The Parade Ground forms part of the 
Central Precinct. Redeveloped in 2006, 
it includes a formal granite paved area, 
terraces flanking each side of the 
Parade Ground, a new staircase 
leading to the main Memorial building 
and 
the 
original 
Stone 
of 
Remembrance, which is located within the central axis 
leading to the building.
The rest of the Central Precinct comprises open lawns, and 
informal, asymmetrical plantings of eucalypts close to the 
main entrance. There is also a stand of mature English oaks 
with their distinctive spreading form to the east of the main 
entry, which contribute to the character of the landscape 
setting.
The Western Precinct
A key component of the Western Precinct is the Sculpture 
Garden. A collection of sculptures, memorials and plaques 
grouped within the formalised landscaping of the precinct, it 
was officially opened in 1999 (refer to Figure 3.42).
The precinct generally is characterised by a formal 
arrangement of mixed exotic plantings of deciduous and 
coniferous trees, open lawn areas, garden beds and paths. 
These provide a setting for the memorials, plaques and 
sculptures of the Sculpture Garden collection.
In addition to these, large artefacts have also been installed 
within the landscape, along the western elevation of the main 
Memorial building, and ANZAC Hall.
The main pedestrian approach to the AWM from the western 
carpark through the Western Precinct and the Sculpture 
Garden defines a key visitor experience, as well as an 
introduction to the themes of the AWM. At the time of writing, 
the Western Precinct contains a series of seven sculptures, 
13 memorials, and numerous commemorative plaques. The 
plaques are generally located in the paved paths and 
courtyard area adjacent to the main Memorial building.

The landscape of the Sculpture Garden is dominated by two 
spreading oak trees and also features memorial groves of 
silver birches, olive and cherry trees related to various 
commemorative themes within the Sculpture Garden. The 
earliest feature of the Western Precinct is the Lone Pine, 
which is also described further below. Since the opening of 
the Sculpture Garden, other sculptures and memorials have 
also been installed within the formalised landscape of the 
Eastern Precinct.
Detailed mapping of the memorials and sculptures within the 
Sculpture Garden is provided in the 2017 Site Development 
Plan.
The Eastern Precinct
To the east of the main Memorial building, planting has been 
developed using eucalypts and wattles to give the 
appearance of an extension of the natural vegetation of 
Mount Ainslie, as proposed in the planting plans of 1952. 
There are juvenile and semi-mature eucalypts planted in the 
irrigated lawns through this area as a more informal 
continuation of the Parade Ground. The area behind Poppy’s 
café is unirrigated and characterised by eucalypts of 
assorted species and ages.
The redevelopment of the Eastern Precinct was completed in 
2011 as the final stage of implementing the AWM Site 
Development Review, 2006. The project was intended to 
provide a high-quality and cohesively designed landscape in 
keeping with that of the Western Precinct and Parade 
Ground, whilst improving parking and visitor safety when 
accessing the Memorial buildings. The demolition of the 
Outpost café was required due to its improper positioning on 
the site and issues relating to accessibility and functionality. 
The new Poppy’s building was designed to provide a more 
accessible and flexible café with on-grade access to the main 
Memorial building, sited within an open natural landscape.
 The Lone Pine
Planted in 1934, just as construction was starting on the main 
Memorial building, the Lone Pine is a significant symbolic 
component of the AWM landscape. The Lone Pine is a Pinus 
halepensis, commonly known as the Aleppo pine. This 
species can grow to a maximum height of 25 metres and it is 
estimated that the Lone Pine has reached this size. The Lone 
Pine occupies a prominent location in the southwestern 
corner of the AWM grounds and is one of the

earliest surviving plantings in the grounds (refer to Figure 3.4). The pine is surrounded by a decorative 
iron railing designed by the noted sculptor W Leslie Bowles.9 The railing was painted green at the 
direction of John Treloar and a bronze plaque with the following inscription was installed to face the 
Limestone Avenue (then Romani Street) frontage of the AWM grounds:
After the capture of the Lone Pine ridge in Gallipoli (6 August 1915), an Australian soldier who had 
taken part in the attack, in which his brother was killed, found a cone on one of the branches used 
by the Turks as overhead cover for their trenches, and sent it to his mother. From seed shed by it 
she raised the tree, which she presented to be planted in the War Memorial grounds in honour of 
her own and others’ sons who fell at Lone Pine.
Two descendant Lone Pine reserve plantings have been propagated from the original AWM Lone Pine, 
the first of which was planted in the Central Precinct in 2014 by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge 
(refer to Figure 3.4).10
 Site Vegetation and Natural Heritage
Appendix H contains a report on the development of the AWM’s landscape, particularly considering the 
age and significance of the native trees and the potential for the site to possess natural heritage values. 
The report concludes that, of the indigenous vegetation species on site, only the two Eucalyptus 
melliodora trees and the small group of Eucalyptus bridgesiana in the Eastern Precinct are currently 
growing in locations where remnant woodland existed at the time of the commencement of the 
landscaping and development of the AWM in the 1930s/1940s. Furthermore, these are mature enough 
to have been present, albeit as saplings only, in the original woodland vegetation pre-existing 
construction on the site, or to have grown in situ from seeds from this native woodland. The two 
individuals of Eucalyptus melliodora are located southeast of the CEW Bean Building, and a small group 
of Eucalyptus bridgesiana is located at the intersection of Treloar Crescent and Fairburn Avenue. Their 
retention within the otherwise cleared and replanted landscape may reflect a design decision on the part 
of the landscapers to retain a link with the original vegetation of the locality. All other native trees, either 
because of their comparatively young age or because they are species that do not naturally occur in the 
area, are considered to be planted trees.
A more recent analysis of the trees, their condition and management requirements is provided in the 
Tree Management Plan prepared by Gold Leaf Tree in February 2018.

 Aboriginal Cultural Heritage
An assessment of the Aboriginal archaeological values of the AWM was undertaken in 2007 in 
conjunction with the previous iteration of the Heritage Management Plan. A review of that report, along 
with a review of recent landscape changes and a search of the ACT Heritage Aboriginal Sites Database, 
indicates that the background research and analysis, along with assessment of archaeological potential 
all remain relevant. However, the values assessment warrants updating. Furthermore, updated 
consultation with the Aboriginal community on the Aboriginal cultural values associated with the place is 
also required. Consultation with the Aboriginal community was undertaken in 2008 but at least one of 
those people consulted at the time has since died, and discussions of values should be periodically 
updated to understand the changes in contemporary views.
On that basis, consultation with the Aboriginal community was undertaken again and an outline of the 
archaeological potential of the site is presented below. An updated values assessment in included in 
Section 4.5.2.
Consultation Outcomes
While all four RAOs were invited to participate in the updated consultation, only Wally Bell of Buru 
Ngunnawal, was available for discussions and a site inspection. During the site inspection the previously 
recorded isolated artefact (AWM1) was not able to be found. The general area around it was notably 
eroded with little remaining topsoil, and therefore, limited archaeological potential.
Wally noted that the presence of artefacts on the landscape was generally of significance to the 
Aboriginal community as evidence of prior occupation of the land. In this case, the individual artefact 
would be considered as of only relatively minor significance. Wally also noted that the AWM was situated 
on a pathway formerly used by Aboriginal people in their traditional use of the landscape in traversing 
from Mount Ainslie down towards the Molonglo River. Although there is little remaining

evidence of the use of the landscape, Aboriginal people would have used the area extensively given that 
it was located between an important high point on the landscape and a traditional ceremonial site (Mount 
Ainslie), and an important resource zone (the river and adjoining flats). Therefore, the general landscape 
is considered to be of significance.
Archaeological Potential
Extensive land use impacts and modification have occurred on the site. The types of disturbance which 
are evident include:
•
original clearance of the native tree cover and understorey;
•
construction of memorial buildings, landscaping and associated structures, access tracks and 
roadways;
•
construction of public utility easements (for example, gas pipelines, communication cables and 
power lines);
•
major earthworks associated with contour mounding and creekline realignments; and
•
creation and maintenance of exotic and native plantings, including ripping of soils.
One Aboriginal site, an isolated artefact (AWM 1) located in a disturbed context, was identified during 
survey for the 2008 HMP. It was concluded that due to past disturbance, there is little potential for further 
or in situ Aboriginal archaeological evidence to survive in association with this artefact. This artefact has 
low archaeological value, and was not able to be found again in 2018. The site visit confirmed that the 
area has limited archaeological potential.
The approximate location of the Aboriginal artefact site is shown in Figure 3.50.

3.3 Comparative Analysis
 Introduction
This section provides a desktop-based comparative analysis to establish the relative importance, rarity 
and representativeness of the AWM in relation to other war memorials and national cultural institutions.
Representativeness refers to a place having value because it is a fine representative example of an 
important class of a significant place or environment.11
The comparative analysis below comprises two parts: the comparison of the Memorial with other 
memorials in Australia—notably those in Melbourne and Sydney; and with other national cultural 
institutions in Canberra.
 War Memorials in Australia
Figure 3.51 ANZAC War Memorial, Sydney. (Source: NSW Government)
ANZAC War Memorial, Sydney
The ANZAC War Memorial is located near Liverpool Street in Hyde Park, Sydney. It is considered the 
state’s principal commemorative and interpretive monument to the service and sacrifice of Australians 
in armed conflicts.
In 1916, the Returned Sailors & Soldiers Imperial League of Australia (RSSILA) began collecting money 
for the establishment of an ANZAC memorial building. While initially developed for ANZAC soldiers who 
fought in the Gallipoli campaign, it later came to represent all Australians who lost their lives in World 
War I.
Following much debate and division regarding the purpose and style of the memorial, a design 
competition for the new building was launched in 1923. Included in the competition’s restrictions were 
Australian applicants only and a cost limit of £75,000, and the building was required to have office 
accommodation for the RSSILA and other soldiers’ associations. The competition was won by Sydney 
architect Charles Bruce Dellit. Dellit deviated from the classical symbolism of the time in favour of more 
abstract images, incorporated into an Art Deco style stepped ziggurat.12 For example:13
The statues on the four corners at the top of the edifice were to be the ‘Four Seasons, 
representing Eternity’. Lower down on the sixteen buttresses were ‘symbolical figures 
representing the arts of war and peace’ and level with the top of the buttresses were ‘bas reliefs 
of Australian soldiers’. On the eastern and western sides were ‘symbolical groups’ of statuary – 
one representing ‘peace crowning endurance and courage’, the other ‘victory after sacrifice’. 
Above the northern and southern doors were classical quotations.

In front of the main monument, the Pool of Reflection extends westward into Hyde Park, surrounded by 
poplar trees.
Construction of the new memorial took place between 1932 and 1934.
The Memorial is included in the NSW Heritage Register as a place of state significance (Place ID: 
01822).
Shrine of Remembrance, Melbourne
Figure 3.52 Shrine of Remembrance, Melbourne. (Source: Wikimedia Commons)
The Shrine of Remembrance is considered the largest and most important war memorial in Victoria. The 
need for a memorial was established in response to the extensive loss of lives in World War I where 
114,000 Victorians enlisted and 19,000 were killed.
Construction of the memorial began in 1927 and was completed in 1934. Later design elements were 
included in 1955.
Construction of the memorial was completed in 1934 to a design by Philip Hudson, James Wardrop and 
Kingsley Ussher.
The Shrine was included in the Register of the National Estate (RNE) in 1998 and is currently included 
in the Victorian Heritage Register (Place ID: 806).
The following description of the memorial comes for the RNE citation:14
The building consists of a truncated stepped pyramid set on a square podium with upper and 
lower terraces. The two north and south facing porticos each incorporate eight Greek Doric 
columns supporting a pediment with allegorical sculpture in the tympana. The external walls and 
steps are a light grey granite from Tynong, the internal walls are a light beige sandstone from 
Redesdale and the sixteen black marble monolithic columns of the Ionic order in the sanctuary 
were quarried at Buchan.

English sculptor Paul Raphael Montford designed the four external corner buttress groups of the 
statuary and the two external tympana; the twelve frieze panels in the sanctuary are the work of 
Australian sculptor Lyndon Dadswell.
High up inside the Sanctuary is a small opening contrived so that at the eleventh hour on the 
eleventh day of the eleventh month of each year, a ray of sunlight strikes through to the Stone of 
Remembrance set into the floor of the Sanctuary.
In addition to the main structure, the Shrine also includes the North Forecourt, the Man with the Donkey 
statue, the Water Trough Memorial and the Macpherson-Robertson Fountain.
Conclusion
The act of building memorials as sites of collective mourning has taken place across towns and cities in 
Australia since the Sudan War in 1885. The first monumental memorials were proposed after World War 
I, with notable examples appearing in the city centres of major capital cities. The ANZAC Memorial in 
Hyde Park, Sydney, and the Shrine of Remembrance in the Domain Parklands, Melbourne, are 
comparable examples to the Memorial in Canberra in terms of architectural grandeur and presence in 
the landscape.
AWM is comparable to the ANZAC Memorial in Hyde Park in that it was designed to serve both symbolic 
and functional purposes. However, it is distinguished by the breadth and scale of the AWM collection 
and exhibitions, and the mission to represent the experiences and sacrifice of all Australians who served.
 National Institutions in Canberra
Australia’s cultural institutions serve to preserve and promote Australian national culture and sense of 
identity.
Canberra is the designated location for the nation’s many cultural institutions.

The National Museum of Australia (NMA) is located on an 11-hectare site on Acton Peninsula in central 
Canberra. The museum was established through the National Museum of Australia Act 1980 (Cth) and 
its role is to develop and maintain the National Historical Collection for the benefit of the nation.15 The 
collection consists of objects acquired by transfer from other government agencies, through donation, 
bequest, and by purchase, and encompasses Australian historical material including the world’s largest 
collection of bark paintings and the collection of the former Australian Institute of Anatomy.16 The 
museum hosts permanent, temporary and travelling exhibitions, and provides education programs and 
classroom resources. In addition to housing the museum’s collection, the NMA is also a popular event 
venue.
In 1997, architects Ashton Raggatt McDougall and Robert Peck von Hartel Trethowan won the 
international design competition for the construction of the new museum. It was opened in 2001. As a 
postmodern structure, the museum sharply contrasts with most of Canberra’s other, older national 
cultural institutions.
The NMA is not included in any statutory heritage lists or registers.

The National Archives of Australia (NAA) was established through the Archives Act 1983 (Cth) to 
preserve Australia’s most valuable government records and encourage their use by the public, and to 
promote good records management by Australian Government agencies.17 The NAA is responsible for 
caring for the most significant records of the Australian Government, including those relating to 
Indigenous Australians, immigration and military service. The collection contains more than 40 million 
items—the biggest single body of records documenting the history of Australia.18
The NAA is located in the East Block building in Canberra’s National Triangle. The building was designed 
by government architect John Smith Murdoch as the Secretariat Building No. 1 (supporting the 
Provisional Parliament House) and constructed in 1925/1926. The NAA is one of the building’s several 
tenants and has occupied the site since 1998.
East Block is included in the CHL (Place ID: 105349) as a significant component of the Parliament House 
Secretariat Group and the National Triangle. The NAA’s role is not a contributing factor in the place’s 
significance.

The National Library of Australia (NLA) was established through the National Library of Australia Act 
1960 (Cth), which sought to ensure that documentary resources of national significance relating to 
Australia and Australian people, as well as significant non-Australian library materials, are collected, 
preserved and made accessible.19 Currently, the NLA is the largest reference library in Australia and 
houses approximately 1 million collection items.
The building is located in the National Triangle in central Canberra, on the southern shores of Lake 
Burley Griffin. The purpose-built library was constructed in 1968 in the Late Twentieth-Century Stripped 
Classical style using traditional materials such as marble, granite, bronze, slate and copper. The building 
was designed by Walter Bunning of the architectural firm Bunning and Madden, in association with T.E. 
O’Mahony.
It is both a national landmark and a popular attraction.

The National Film and Sound Archive (NFSA) was established in 1984 as Australia’s premier audiovisual 
archive. Originally part of the National Library collection, it was decided that a new semi- autonomous 
body was needed to manage the nitrate film collection. Currently, there are over 2.8 million items in its 
collection, including films, television and radio programs, videos, audio tapes, records, compact discs, 
phonograph cylinders and wire recordings as well as documents, photographs, posts and other 
artefacts.
The NFSA is housed in the former Institute of Anatomy building (1931–1984) in Acton by the Australian 
National University campus, in Canberra’s north. The building reflects the Late Twentieth- Century 
Stripped Classical architectural style with Australian Art Deco detailing and was constructed in 
1930/1931.
The Institute of Anatomy is included in the CHL (Place ID: 105351) and comprises the main building, its 
surrounds and the former director’s residence. It is considered significant for its architectural style and 
detailing, as a key public building provided by the Federal Capital Commission in the first phase of 
Canberra’s development, and for housing the NFSA and its collection.

The National Gallery of Australia (NGA) is located within the National Triangle on the southern shore of 
Lake Burley Griffin in Canberra. The NGA was established through the National Gallery Act 1975 (Cth). 
The role of the NGA is to develop and maintain the national art collection and to exhibit and make it 
available to the public. The collection consists of more than 153,000 works of art acquired through 
purchase, gifts and bequests and is grouped into five main areas: Indigenous and non- Indigenous 
Australian art; Asian art; Pacific art; and European and American art.20 The Gallery is open to the public 
with permanent, temporary and travelling exhibitions.
The NGA building was designed by Colin Madigan of Edwards Madigan Torzillo and Partners—the 
winners of the 1968 design competition. The exterior of the three-storey Brutalist building is 
predominantly reinforced bush-hammered concrete with exposed triangular patterning. In 2010, a major 
extension to the building was completed by architect Andrew Andersons of PTW Architects, providing a 
more legible entrance and a large Indigenous galleries area.21
The NGA is a representative example of a national institution that has remained as originally intended, 
a public gallery space to showcase the substantial and growing national art collection.

Figure 3.58 The Royal Australian Mint. (Source: GML Heritage 2018)
The Royal Australian Mint (the Mint) is located on 3.5 hectares of land approximately 4 kilometres 
southwest of Parliament House in the suburb of Deakin. The Commonwealth of Australia Constitution 
Act of 1901 (Cth) ensured that the Government could make laws about currency, coinage and legal 
tender.22 The Coinage Act 1909 (Cth) set in motion the first steps for Australian coinage.23 The 
construction of the Mint commenced on the Deakin site in 1962 and was opened by His Royal Highness, 
Prince Philip in 1965. The Mint was tasked with the production of the first coins of the new decimal 
currency in 1966 and has since struck 15 billion circulating coins. The Mint holds guided tours for the 
public including school groups and has a visitor gallery open to the public, with educational programs 
and displays, interpretation of coinage and a retail shop.24
The Mint incorporates two buildings, the Former Administration Building and the Process Building, both 
typical of Twentieth-Century Stripped Classical architecture with symmetrical massing and considered 
proportions. The buildings are clad in sandstone with white/grey marble clad column-like elements.
As a national institution, the Mint is distanced from the central parliamentary zone of Canberra. However, 
it is a good example of a large public institution that has continued in its original purpose.

Old Parliament House
Figure 3.59 Old Parliament House. (Source: Museum of Australian Democracy)
Old Parliament House (OPH) was the seat of the Parliament of Australia from 1927 to 1988. Located on 
King George Terrace, OPH is in a prominent location on the land axis and at the base of Capital Hill in 
the Parliamentary Triangle. Now the venue of the Museum of Australian Democracy, the building is open 
as a public exhibition, events and educational space.
The museum aims to advance the national conversation about democracy through engagement, 
education and outreach.25 The collection includes heritage objects that were used or were part of the 
Old Parliament House building until parliament’s relocation in 1988. The building itself is arguably the 
most important ‘object’ in the collection and is included in both the CHL and NHL. Visitor engagement 
includes programs such as school group tours, public tours, events and activities, and family-oriented 
exhibitions.26
The building is of the style referred to as ‘Twentieth-Century Stripped Classical’ architecture, seen in 
many other works by Commonwealth Architect John Smith Murdoch. The low, two-storey building 
employs elements of classical architecture including repetition and order, symmetry and a columned 
façade.
3.4 Conclusion
The comparative analysis demonstrates that the AWM is one of a broader class of national cultural 
institutions established in Caberra to preserve and promote Australia’s national culture and sense of 
identity. The AWM’s significant architecture and prominent positioning within the centre of Canberra, 
including within the boundaries of the Parliament House Vista, are principal characteristics of national 
institutions established within Canberra.
The AWM also serves as an important early example of the use of the Australian Art Deco architectural 
style, through its use of contrasting horizontal lines, vertical features and Art Deco detailing.
The AWM is rare, compared with other national cultural institutions located within Canberra, for its unique 
function as a combined shrine, museum and archive.

Australian War Memorial—Heritage Management Plan—Revised Final Report, March 2022
4.0 Understanding the Heritage Values
4.1 Introduction
The AWM is a place of recognised National and Commonwealth Heritage value—included on the NHL 
in 2006 (Place ID: 105889) and the CHL in 2004 (Place ID: 105469). The official citations are included 
in Appendix E and F.
National and Commonwealth Heritage values have a specific meaning under the EPBC Act and these 
are the values that the Australian Heritage Council have identified, and the Minister has officially listed 
for a place. As such, any statutory obligations under the EPBC Act related to National and 
Commonwealth Heritage values apply to the values as gazetted and stated in the official listing. 
Following the EPBC Act and Regulations, Commonwealth agencies have a responsibility to identify, 
assess and monitor listed and possible National and Commonwealth Heritage values of places they own 
or manage. The management of National and Commonwealth Heritage places also should respect all 
heritage values of the place. In addition, the EPBC Act protects all heritage values on Commonwealth 
land from actions which are likely to have a significant impact on these values (also refer to Section 
5.2.2).
The purpose of this section is to explain the legislative requirements (refer to Section 4.2) and state the 
listed National and Commonwealth Heritage values of the AWM as officially gazetted and listed. Section
4.4 provides a commentary on the listed values to validate them, ensure that any changes, errors and/or 
gaps are addressed, and any new heritage values are identified. This HMP provides the AWM with the 
framework to manage the listed National and Commonwealth Heritage values and to ensure that any 
recommended updated or additional values (identified in the commentary in Section 4.4) are 
acknowledged and appropriately managed (through this HMP).
4.2 Identifying Heritage Values
Assessments of heritage value identify whether a place has heritage significance, establish what the 
heritage values are, and why the place (or an element of a place) is considered important and valuable 
to the community. Heritage values are embodied in attributes, such as the location, function, form and 
fabric of a place. Intangible attributes may also be significant, including use, access, traditions, cultural 
practices, knowledge and the sensory and experiential responses that the place evokes. All attributes 
need to be considered when assessing a place.
The Burra Charter: the Australia ICOMOS Charter for Places of Cultural Significance 2013 (the Burra 
Charter) and its Guidelines for the Assessment of Cultural Significance recommends that significance is 
assessed in categories such as aesthetic, historic, technical, scientific and social significance.
Identifying the many layers of value of heritage—its sites, places, elements and collections—and 
assessing their relative values through this report provides the knowledge base needed for the framing 
and implementation of heritage management and conservation policies discussed in Section 6.0.
4.2.1 Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth)
Section 528 of the EPBC Act defines the ‘heritage value’ of a place as including the place’s natural and 
cultural environment, having aesthetic, historic, scientific or social significance, or other significance, for 
current and future generations of Australians. The EPBC Act therefore covers all forms of cultural 
significance (Indigenous and non-Indigenous) and natural heritage significance.

Australian War Memorial—Heritage Management Plan—Revised Final Report, March 2022
The 2004 amendments to the EPBC Act established the Commonwealth and National Heritage Lists. 
The CHL is for those places owned or controlled by the Commonwealth that have been assessed as 
having significant heritage values against the criteria established under that Act. Places identified as 
being of outstanding heritage value for the nation are eligible for inclusion in the NHL. NHL places do 
not have to be owned by the Commonwealth.
Section 10.01A and Section 10.03A of the EPBC Regulations define the nine National and 
Commonwealth Heritage criteria for evaluating, identifying and assessing the Commonwealth or 
National Heritage values of a place. Note that the only difference between them is the threshold for 
National Heritage value, which is at an outstanding level of significance.
The threshold for inclusion in the CHL or NHL is that the place meets one or more of the criteria for 
‘significant’ or ‘outstanding’ heritage values respectively.
In addition to the NHL and CHL, the EPBC Act also protects all heritage on Commonwealth land. It also 
protects heritage outside Commonwealth land, from actions happening on Commonwealth land or by 
Commonwealth agencies. In accordance with the definition of ‘heritage values’ under the Act, this 
includes Indigenous, historic and natural heritage values. These heritage values may or may not be 
listed on the NHL and CHL. These heritage values should be identified, recognised and managed as 
part of the management of any Commonwealth-owned or managed heritage place.
4.2.2 Indigenous Heritage Values
Indigenous/Aboriginal cultural values and heritage management aims to sustain the relationship 
between Indigenous people and their heritage places. Assessments of Indigenous heritage values 
should take into consideration the principles outlined in the Ask First Guidelines,1 in which consultation 
is a key factor in the process of identifying heritage values.
In recognising the rights and interests of Indigenous peoples in their heritage, all parties concerned 
with identifying, conserving and managing this heritage should acknowledge, accept and act on the 
principles that Indigenous people:
•
are the primary source of information on the value of their heritage and how this is best conserved;
•
must have an active role in any Indigenous heritage planning process;
•
must have input into primary decision-making in relation to Indigenous heritage so they can 
continue to fulfil their obligations towards this heritage; and
•
must control intellectual property and other information relating specifically to the 
heritage, as this may be an integral aspect of its heritage values.
In identifying and managing this heritage:
•
uncertainty about Indigenous heritage values at a place should not be used to justify 
activities that might damage or desecrate this heritage;
•
all parties having relevant interests should be consulted on indigenous heritage matters; and
•
the process and outcomes of Indigenous heritage planning must abide by customary 
law, relevant Commonwealth and State/Territory laws, relevant International treaties and 
covenants and any other legally binding agreements.
Adhering to cultural restrictions on information about an Indigenous heritage place is essential to 
maintaining its heritage value.2

4.2.3 Natural Heritage Values
As outlined in the Australian Natural Heritage Charter, for the conservation of places of natural heritage 
significance,3 natural heritage is defined as:
Natural heritage comprises the natural living and non-living components, that is, the biodiversity 
and geodiversity, of the world that humans inherit. It incorporates a range of values, from 
existence value to socially-based values.
In making decisions that will affect the future of a place it is important to consider all heritage values— 
both natural and cultural—as issues relating to the conservation and heritage management of cultural 
values that may affect the selection of appropriate conservation processes, actions and strategies for 
the place’s natural values.4
4.3 National and Commonwealth Heritage Values
4.3.1 National Heritage List Statement of Significance
The following Statement of Significance is from the National Heritage citation for the ‘Australian War 
Memorial and the Memorial Parade’.
The Australian War Memorial (AWM) is Australia’s national shrine to those Australians who lost 
their lives and suffered as a result of war. As such it is important to the Australian community as a 
whole and has special associations with veterans and their families including the Returned & 
Services League of Australia. These special associations are reinforced on ANZAC Day and at 
ceremonies specific to particular memorials on Anzac Parade.
The AWM in its setting was a direct consequence of the First World War, one of the seminal 
events in Australian history. Official war correspondent, Charles Bean, believed that the war 
would have a strong influence on the creation of a sense of nationhood and a distinctly Australian 
character and identity. Bean’s vision of a war memorial as a place to house the objects made 
sacred by their direct association with the events and sacrifice of Australians at war was 
embodied in the establishment of the AWM. A purpose built repository, the AWM is a place where 
the nature of commemoration was based on an integral relationship between the building, 
commemorative spaces and the collections of objects and records. This is rare in Australia and 
uncommon in the world. The AWM has a unique and important function in collecting and 
displaying objects and records of Australians’ experience of war. It has the potential to yield 
information that will contribute to Australia’s social, political and military history.
The role of the AWM with its central location in the nation’s capital is an important landmark in 
Australia and a popular national icon. Although the AWM was not part of the original design for 
Canberra, Walter Burley Griffin agreed that it would be a fitting structure for its prominent position. 
The surrounding landscape design, indigenous and exotic plantings and setting and sympathetic 
location of associated structures and the symmetry of land axis have maintained the importance 
of the views of the AWM and its dominance in the landscape. As the terminating building at the 
northern end of the land axis of Griffin’s plan for Canberra, the AWM makes a major contribution 
to the principal views from both Parliament Houses and from Mount Ainslie. Major features of the 
original site include: the main building; the external fabric; the ceremonial landscape including 
indigenous and exotic plantings immediately in front of the main building; the Lone Pine tree; and 
displays and sculptures. The Hall of Memory with the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier 
and in conjunction with aspects of its setting, demonstrates changing and evolving concepts of 
commemoration. The courtyard and its honour colonnade, the reflection pool and plantings 
contribute to its outstanding significance.
The AWM in its setting is of outstanding importance for its aesthetic characteristics. The place is 
highly valued for its great beauty by the Australian community and veteran groups. The main

building and the surrounding landscape, the Hall of Memory, the Roll of Honour, ANZAC Hall and

triggers disturbing and poignant responses from the vast majority of visitors and has also inspired 
artistic works such as paintings and photographs.

Australian War Memorial—Heritage Management Plan—Revised Final Report, March 2022
The AWM and Anzac Parade have special associations with Australia’s military forces and with 
veterans as represented by the Returned & Services League of Australia and community groups. 
Anzac Parade was opened on ANZAC Day 1965, the fiftieth anniversary of the landing of the 
ANZACs at Gallipoli. It is the setting for a series of memorials commemorating Australian service 
and sacrifice in war and is the major national venue for the ANZAC Day march and other 
ceremonies to commemorate those who served Australia in times of conflict. Anzac Parade, as 
part of the Parliamentary Vista and as an extension of the AWM, has a deep symbolism for many 
Australians, and has become part of one of the major cultural landscapes of Australia. The notion 
of a ceremonial space of this grandeur is not found elsewhere in Australia and Anzac Parade is 
nationally important for its public and commemorative functions. The memorials along Anzac 
Parade also demonstrate changing and evolving concepts of commemoration, under the influence 
of veteran, community and migrant groups and the armed forces. The AWM has special 
associations with Charles Bean, John Treloar and Sir Henry Gullett who contributed to building 
the national identity through their work.5
4.3.2 Commonwealth Heritage List Statement of Significance
The following Statement of Significance is from the Commonwealth Heritage citation for the ‘Australian 
War Memorial’.
The Australian War Memorial is Australia’s National Shrine to those Australians who lost their 
lives and suffered as a result of war. As such it is important to the Australian community as a 
whole and has special associations with veterans and their families and descendants of those 
who fought in wars (Criteria A.4, H.1 and G.1).
The Memorial building is a purpose built repository where the nature of commemoration is based 
in equal parts in the relationship between the building, the collections of objects and records and 
the commemorative spaces. This is unique in Australia and believed rare in the world (Criterion 
B.2).
The building is one of Canberra’s earliest major examples of Australian Art Deco architecture, 
with fine examples of applied art in the same style. The building’s design also successfully fulfils 
its special functions and reinforces the role of the place as a Shrine (Criterion D.2).
The War Memorial is an important landmark in Canberra, Australia’s National Capital. As the 
terminating building at the northern end of the land axis of Griffin’s city design and one of only 
three buildings sited on the axis, the Memorial makes a major contribution to the principal views 
from both Parliament Houses (Criterion E.1).
The success of the Memorial as a landmark is due in part to its distinctive massing and 
symmetry; its relative visual isolation given its privileged siting on the land axis; landscaped 
grounds and the backdrop of the forested slopes of Mount Ainslie. The role of the Memorial as 
a National icon is reinforced by its central location in the nation’s capital (Criterion F.1).
The Memorial’s success as a shrine, an architectural form and as part of Canberra’s urban plan 
results in part from special associations with the lives and works of a number of individuals 
whose activities have been significant in Australia’s history. These include the Memorial’s 
founders Charles Bean, John Treloar and Henry Gullett; architects Emil Sodersteen and John 
Crust; and M Napier Waller who created artworks for the building (Criterion H.1).6

The status of the statutory National and Commonwealth Heritage values of the site and the proposed 
revision, below, is based on the current attributes and condition of the AWM site as of September 2018– 
June 2021. The development project, noted in Section 3, may change the status or condition of both the 
listed National and Commonwealth Heritage values as well as the identified revised values.
To reflect any changes to these values, on completion of the development project the Memorial will 
undertake a review of the heritage values as part of an update to the HMP. This update is to be 
undertaken on the completion of the project or five years from the approval of this HMP, whichever is 
sooner. The Memorial will seek an update of the official National and Commonwealth Heritage values of 
the site as needed based on this revision (refer to Policy 1.1). In addition to updating the statutory 
heritage values, a formal revision of the NHL and CHL citations for the AWM will also provide the 
opportunity for an up to date record of the condition of the site, and for the inclusion of any new or revised 
information about the history of the AWM to be added to the official citations.

suggested revision finds ‘additional’, identified values under criteria (d) Characteristic Values and (f) 
Creative or Technical Achievement.
Table 4.1 Review of National Heritage Values—Official Citation and Suggested Revision.
Criterion (a) Processes—the place’s importance in the course, or pattern, of Australia’s natural or 
cultural history.
Official Statement 
of Heritage Value
The AWM is an outstanding national museum and memorial, as expressed through 
the main building, the courtyard fabric, interior spaces, the Sculpture Garden and 
the collections. The AWM was established as a direct consequence of the First 
World War, one of the seminal events in Australian history. It embodied the vision of 
Charles Bean—Official First World War correspondent—that the war would be 
instrumental in creating a sense of nationhood and a distinctly Australian identity. 
The institution plays a pivotal role in helping Australians to commemorate and 
understand the sacrifice and loss of Australians during war.
The AWM together with Anzac Parade is an important national icon. Its major 
features include: the main building; the medieval stone lions at the entrance; the 
ceremonial landscape including the Lone Pine tree; and displays and sculptures. 
The AWM and Anzac Parade are major venues for national commemorative 
services and events such as the ANZAC Day march.
Anzac Parade, as part of the Parliamentary Vista and an extension of the AWM, is 
part of one of the major designed landscapes of Australia. A ceremonial space of 
this grandeur is unique in Australia.
The AWM and the memorials along Anzac Parade represent changing concepts of 
commemoration in Australia, influenced by the armed forces and community groups. 
The Hall of Memory with the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier, and aspects 
of its setting are notable.

The AWM collection contains unique objects including a Lancaster bomber and the 
largest collection of Victoria Crosses in the world. The building contains rare 
elements, notably the medieval stone lions at the entrance and the Hall of Memory 
with its largest mosaics in the world.
Anzac Parade, as part of the Parliamentary Vista and as an extension of the AWM, is 
part of one of the major cultural landscapes of Australia. The grandeur of the 
ceremonial space is not found elsewhere in Australia.
Anzac Parade is nationally important for its public and commemorative functions.
Commentary
The claim that the mosaics in the Hall of Memory are the largest mosaics in the 
world is not substantiated. The Memorial Art Section advises the Hall of Memory 
mosaic is the largest in the southern hemisphere, not the world.
The statement regarding the Memorial’s collection of Victoria Crosses (VCs) is 
incorrect, and only relates to collections in public hands. The largest collection of 
VCs is held privately, by Lord Ashcroft, on public display at the Imperial War 
Museum in the UK. In addition to the Museum’s own collection, this exhibition 
houses the largest collection of VCs on display in a public institution.
The statement that the Lancaster bomber is unique is unfounded. There are 17 known 
largely complete Avro Lancasters in the world and two are airworthy. This makes the 
AWM’s Lancaster rare but not unique.
Suggested 
Revision
The AWM is a purpose-built repository, reflecting the integral relationship between the 
building, commemorative spaces and the collections. This is unique in Australia and 
rare elsewhere in the world. The values are expressed in the fabric of the main 
building, the entrance, the Hall of Memory, the collections and the surrounding 
landscape.
The Memorial’s collection contains rare and valuable objects including a Lancaster 
bomber, medieval stone lions at the entrance and the largest public collection of 
Victoria Crosses in the world. The Hall of Memory contains the largest mosaics in 
the southern hemisphere.
ANZAC Parade, as part of the Parliamentary Vista and as an extension of the AWM, 
is part of one of the major cultural landscapes of Australia. The grandeur of the 
ceremonial space is not found elsewhere in Australia. ANZAC Parade is nationally 
important for its public and commemorative functions.
Criterion (c) Potential for Information—the place’s potential to yield information that will 
contribute to an understanding of Australia’s natural or cultural history.
Official Statement 
of Heritage Value
The AWM has a unique and important function in the nation in collecting and 
displaying objects and records on Australians’ experience of war. The AWM and 
other institutions have used these materials to produce research on social, political 
and military history. The place has the potential to yield further substantial 
information on Australians’ experience of war. These values are expressed through 
the collections.
Commentary
The NHL statement provides and accurate evaluation against criterion (c).
Suggested 
Revision
No revisions are suggested.
Criterion (d) Characteristic Values— the place’s importance in demonstrating the principal 
characteristics of:
–a class of Australia’s natural or cultural places; or
–a class of Australia’s natural or cultural environments.
Official Statement 
of Heritage Value
No values identified.
Commentary
As discussed in Section 3.3.2 of this report, the AWM is comparable in terms of its 
architectural grandeur and presence in the landscape with the ANZAC Memorial in 
Hyde Park, Sydney and the Shrine of Remembrance in the Domain Parklands, 
Melbourne.

Memory, the Roll of Honour, ANZAC Hall and the collections act as reminders of 
important events and people in Australia’s history and trigger disturbing and 
poignant responses from the vast majority of visitors.
The AWM together with Anzac Parade form an important national landmark that is 
highly valued by the Australian community. As part of the Parliamentary Vista, the 
AWM makes a major contribution to the principal views from both Parliament 
Houses and Mount Ainslie. Views from Anzac Parade to the Hall of Memory, and 
from the Hall of Memory along the land axis are outstanding. Its prominent position 
is important due to its relative visual isolation on the Griffin land axis, amid the 
backdrop of the forested slopes of Mount Ainslie. The visual impact of the AWM 
when viewed from Parliament House and other points along Griffin’s land axis 
including Mount Ainslie; and the fabric of Anzac Parade including the memorials, 
plantings and lighting is far more distinctive and dramatic compared to the other 
principal war memorials in Australia.

Anzac Parade make to the Parliament House Vista.
Suggested 
Revision
The AWM is significant for demonstrating a high degree of both creative and 
technical achievement as a major component of the Parliament House Vista. The 
AWM, in conjunction with Anzac Parade and Parliament House, are central to the 
planned city, as discussed in the Parliament House Vista HMP:
The study area displays characteristics of the City Beautiful approach to 
urban planning with its objectives of beauty and monumental grandeur 
through the use of such features as axes, vistas, wide boulevards (ie. 
Commonwealth and Kings Avenues, actually outside the area), spacious 
parks and large graceful public buildings. In addition, there are Garden 
City influences such as the landscaped, low density development with 
tree-lined streets, parkways, parks and gardens. While the evolved design 
of Canberra overall has a combination of City Beautiful and Garden City 
influences, the City Beautiful influences are more distinct in the Parliament 
House Vista area than elsewhere in the city…7
Criterion (g) Social Values— the place’s strong or special associations with a particular community 
or cultural group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.
Official Statement 
of Heritage Value
The AWM is the national war museum and national shrine, and together with Anzac 
Park, has special associations for the Australian community, particularly veterans 
and their families. These special associations are reinforced on ANZAC Day and at 
ceremonies specific to particular memorials on Anzac Parade. The AWM and the 
Anzac Parade memorials are the nation’s major focal point for commemoration 
including the ANZAC Day march and other ceremonies and events. These values 
are expressed through: the AWM building (including the Hall of Memory); the 
collection; the surrounding landscape (including the Sculpture Garden); and Anzac

It has served another historic function as a museum and archive dedicated to 
helping Australians remember, interpret and understand the Australian 
experience of war and its enduring impact on Australian society.
Attributes:
•
Its foremost historical and significant function as a shrine demonstrated by 
the main Memorial building’s architectural form, character and key spaces 
and elements including the Hall of Memory, Commemorative Area, Roll of 
Honour and dioramas within the galleries;
•
the museum, archive and the Memorial’s collection;
•
the landscape setting of the AWM buildings, including the open 
surrounds and natural landscape backdrop of Mount Ainslie; and
the central location of the AWM within Canberra and its siting at the northern 
extent of Griffin’s Land Axis and Anzac Parade.
Criterion (b) Rarity—the place’s possession of uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of 
Australia’s natural or cultural history.

Australian War Memorial—Heritage Management Plan—Revised Final Report, March 2022
Official Statement of 
Heritage Value
The Memorial building is a purpose-built repository where the nature of 
commemoration is based in equal parts in the relationship between the building, 
the collections of objects and records and the commemorative spaces. This is 
unique in Australia and believed rare in the world.
Attributes
The equal relationship between the building, the collections of objects and records 
and the commemorative spaces.
Commentary
The AWM is rare for its nature in Australia. However, the current Commonwealth 
Heritage listing does not clearly establish a justification for the claim that the 
Memorial’s nature as a place where commemoration is based on the relationship 
between the building, the collections and the commemorative spaces is rare in the 
world. Further investigation and comparison with other similar places would need to 
be undertaken to establish this as a globally rare characteristic of heritage 
significance possessed by the Memorial. This investigation should be undertaken as 
part of a comprehensive review of the heritage values as part of future updates to 
this HMP to validate this claim.
Minor editorial changes to CHL text are recommended to reflect the scope of 
available information at this time about the rarity of the AWM nationally and 
globally.
Suggested Revision
The Australian War Memorial is the only purpose-built institution in Australia that 
performs the collective function of a memorial, museum and archive.
Attributes:
The collective function and equal relationship within the AWM site as a shrine, with its 
commemorative spaces, and as a museum and archive of records.
Criterion (c) Potential for Information—the place’s potential to yield information that will contribute 
to an understanding of Australia’s natural or cultural history.
Official Statement of 
Heritage Value
No assessment is included in the official assessment.
Commentary
The assessment does not consider the potential information that the AWM’s collection 
could yield.
Suggested Revision
The Memorial’s collection, comprising documentary archival material and objects, 
provide opportunity for further investigation and research into the experiences of 
Australians in war.
Attributes:
The Memorial’s collection.
Criterion (d) Characteristic Values— the place’s importance in demonstrating the principal 
characteristics of:
–a class of Australia’s natural or cultural places; or
–a class of Australia’s natural or cultural environments.
Official Statement of 
Heritage Value
The building is one of Canberra’s earliest major examples of Australian Art Deco 
architecture, with fine examples of applied art in the same style. The building’s 
design also successfully fulfils its special functions and reinforces the role of the 
place as a Shrine.
Attributes
Its architectural styling and design, plus its applied art.
Commentary
The assessment could be explained further with reference to the comparative 
analysis in Section 3.3 of this report.

Australian War Memorial—Heritage Management Plan—Revised Final Report, March 2022
Suggested Revision
The AWM, specifically the main Memorial building, is significant as one of 
Canberra’s earliest major examples of the Australian Art Deco architectural style, 
exemplified by the strong horizontal lines of the stepped parapet contrasted with 
the vertical features of the centralised tower and monumental entrance. Art Deco 
detailing is also evident and is particularly strongly represented in the geometric 
symmetry of the dome mosaic in the Hall of Memory.
The AWM is significant for demonstrating the principal characteristics of major war 
memorials and monuments that were constructed nationally post World War I. 
These characteristics include its ongoing function as a place of public 
commemoration, architectural grandeur, prominent siting within a landscaped 
setting, decorative symbolism and strong view lines towards the AWM, specifically 
the main Memorial building, from outside the site.
The AWM also exhibits the principal characteristics of the broader class of national 
cultural institutions demonstrated by its location in central Canberra, siting at the 
northern extent of Griffin’s Land Axis,

Criterion (e) Aesthetic Characteristics— the place’s importance in exhibiting particular aesthetic 
characteristics valued by a community or cultural group.
Official Statement 
of Heritage Value
The War Memorial is an important landmark in Canberra, Australia’s National 
Capital. As the terminating building at the northern end of the land axis of Griffin’s 
city design and one of only three buildings sited on the axis, the Memorial makes 
a major contribution to the principal views from both Parliament Houses.
Attributes

location as the terminating building at the northern end of the Land Axis; and
•
Memorial building, prominent in a landscape setting, including the backdrop of 
Mount Ainslie.
Commentary
The aesthetic characteristics of the main Memorial building have not been mentioned.
The assessment could be updated to make reference to the community-held values 
as documented in the Parliament House Vista and Anzac Parade HMPs.
Suggested Revision The AWM is highly valued by the community, locally and nationally, as a building and 
shrine of artistic excellence.
The dignified and sacred nature of the main Memorial building is characterised by 
the building’s two main elements: the Commemorative Courtyard with the Pool of 
Reflection and framing loggias, and the Hall of Memory. The aesthetic value of the 
AWM is further demonstrated by the use of the Australian Art Deco architectural 
style and detailing, particularly represented by the main Memorial building’s 
distinctive massing and symmetry. The Hall of Memory with its domed ceiling, 
mosaic and stained glassed windows is an exceptional embodiment of Art Deco 
detailing.
The AWM is also aesthetically important as the terminating building at the northern 
end of the land axis of Walter Burley and Marion Mahony Griffin’s city design for 
Canberra. It is one of only three buildings sited on the axis, making the AWM a 
major contribution to the principal views from Old Parliament House and Parliament, 
and a landmark in the landscape. The relative visual isolation of the AWM, given its 
privileged and prominent siting on the Land Axis and Anzac Parade, in combination 
with the landscaped grounds and the backdrop of the forested slopes of Mount 
Ainslie, emphasises the impressive and distinctive quality of the place. The role of 
the AWM as a national icon is reinforced by its central location in the nation’s 
capital.
The AWM is recognised in the Australian Institute of Architects’ Register of 
Significant Twentieth Century Architecture for exhibiting particular aesthetic 
characteristics and by the receipt of several architectural and other industry 
awards.
Appreciation of the aesthetic qualities of the AWM, and its position within the 
Canberra landscape, by the community has been well documented in the 
Parliament House Vista and Anzac Parade HMPs.

Criterion (f) Degree of Creative or Technical Achievement— the place’s importance in 
demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a particular period.
Official Statement 
of Heritage Value
The success of the Memorial as a landmark is due in part to its distinctive massing 
and symmetry; its relative visual isolation given its privileged siting on the land axis; 
landscaped grounds and the backdrop of the forested slopes of Mount Ainslie. The 
role of the Memorial as a National icon is reinforced by its central location in the 
nation’s capital.
Attributes
Its distinctive massing and symmetry; its prominent siting on the Land Axis, its 
landscaped grounds and its setting against the backdrop of the forested slopes of 
Mount Ainslie.
Commentary
The AWM has been recognised by the Australian Institute of Architects for its 
creative achievement. The assessment could be expanded to mention this. The 
AWM also features an extensive collection of artwork, including some dioramas that 
represent a high level of creative and technical achievement.
Suggested 
Revision
The main Memorial building is significant for demonstrating a high degree of both 
creative and technical achievement as one of Canberra’s earliest and most 
substantial public buildings and as a major example of the Australian Art Deco 
architectural style.
The Sodersteen and Crust hybrid design of the main Memorial building was 
considered an achievement in innovation and economic rationalism.
The main Memorial building is recognised in the Australian Institute of Architects’ 
Register of Significant Twentieth Century Architecture for its high degree of creative 
achievement.
The AWM has been recognised for its creative and technical achievement through 
several architectural and other industry awards that it has received.
The AWM features an extensive collection of artwork representing a high level of 
creative and technical achievement. These include the Hall of Memory mosaics, 
sculptures and individual memorials, both individually and as components of the 
formal landscapes of the Sculpture Garden and the Eastern Precinct.
Some of the dioramas in the Memorial’s collection are considered to be outstanding 
examples of their genre, featuring a high level of creative and artistic achievement, 
in particular the First World War and Kapyong dioramas. As a whole, the collection 
demonstrates the ongoing commitment of the Memorial to employ artists and 
sculptors to create this form of interpretive display, which is now closely associated 
with the AWM.
Attributes:
•
the distinctive massing and symmetry of the main Memorial building, its 
prominent siting at the northern extent of Griffin’s Land Axis and within a

The AWM, through the Commemorative Area, and areas of quiet reflection within the 
grounds, invites reflection on the intangible values of sacrifice, identity, ANZAC 
spirit, loss, grief, pride and memory.
The exhibitions through their display of the physical remains of war, and 
communication of the collective and individual stories of Australians, provide visitors 
with secondary experiences of conflict/war.
The AWM as a whole—including the Commemorative Area, galleries and 
landscape—induces personal and emotional experiences through participation in 
the collective act of remembering.
The connections are varied and unquantifiable but are based on a strong and 
special connection with the AWM as a physical place and symbol of Australia’s 
participation in armed conflict.
While community-based research on the significance of the AWM’s galleries has not 
been undertaken, the significance of the AWM under this criterion is arguably 
demonstrated in the high number of guests who visit the place to pay their respects, 
the rates of participation and attendance in special events, and through visitor 
response data, such as TripAdvisor and exit surveys undertaken by exhibition staff.
Attributes:
The whole AWM site, including its commemorations, displays and records.
Criterion (h) Significant People— the place’s special association with the life or works of a person, 
or group of persons, of importance in Australia’s natural or cultural history.
Official Statement 
of Heritage Value
The Australian War Memorial has special associations with veterans and their 
families and descendants of those who fought in wars.
The Memorial’s success as a shrine, an architectural form and as part of Canberra’s 
urban plan results in part from special associations with the lives and works of a 
number of individuals whose activities have been significant in Australia’s history. 
These include the Memorial’s founders Charles Bean, John Treloar and Henry 
Gullett; architects Emil Sodersteen and John Crust; and M Napier Waller who 
created artworks for the building.
Attributes
The whole building, including its architectural design, its setting, its 
commemorations, its artworks, displays, memorabilia and archival records.
Commentary

natural heritage significance when measured against the criteria for the CHL. Rather, the grounds of the 
AWM have been extensively cleared, planted and replanted to create the current landscape.
The AWM grounds are therefore a planned cultural landscape and have little potential for natural heritage 
values. However, heritage values on the site that are not listed at the National and Commonwealth level, 
including any possible natural heritage values, must still be managed appropriately. Further information 
on vegetation and the potential for natural heritage values can be found at Appendix H.
4.5.2 Indigenous Heritage Values
Indigenous people have occupied Canberra and the surrounding region for more than 20,000 years, and 
the landscape of the central Canberra area and its natural and cultural environment continue to have 
cultural heritage significance to the Traditional Owners.
The assessment of Indigenous heritage values has been updated and is based on consultation with 
Indigenous community representatives, outlined in Section 3.2.11. Detailed analysis of the 
archaeological potential is provided in Appendix I.
Before the coming of colonial settlers in the 1820s Aboriginal people occupied the hills and limestone 
plains of the Molonglo Valley. This broader landscape surrounding the AWM has been identified as of 
significance to the Aboriginal community. Black Mountain, Mount Ainslie and the area between them are 
identified as significant women’s sites and cultural landscapes, while Mount Ainslie was a traditional 
ceremonial site from which the Aboriginal community travelled down to the river plains. Aboriginal 
community representatives indicated during consultation that it is this broader landscape context of the 
AWM that has Indigenous cultural significance. The location of the AWM on a pathway formerly used by 
Aboriginal people in their traditional use of the landscape is important, though not in itself a ‘traditional 
value’ under criterion (i).
As discussed in Section 3.2.11, the site of the AWM has been extensively modified and impacted by 
land use changes. As a result, the assessed potential for remaining in situ Aboriginal archaeology is low. 
One isolated artefact (AWM 1) has been found in the past, albeit in a disturbed context. The artefact is 
a tangible reminder of the prior use of this landscape by Aboriginal people; however, as a single entity it 
would not meet the threshold for having Commonwealth Heritage value. As a result, significant 
archaeological heritage values have not been identified as part of consultation or the assessment of 
Indigenous heritage values.
While the AWM does not currently have listed Indigenous heritage values, under the EPBC Act National 
or Commonwealth heritage criteria, all heritage values at the site must be considered and protected as 
part of the environment when taking actions at the AWM. Any Indigenous heritage issues or sensitivities 
must be managed appropriately as part of the management and conservation of the site.
4.5.3 Values as Part of the Parliament House Vista
The AWM is included in the CHL citation for the Parliament House Vista. The following quotations from 
the Summary Statement of Significance for the Parliament House Vista help to draw out the heritage 
values of the AWM in its broader context.
Design Importance
The Parliament House Vista is the central designed landscape of Canberra, that expresses the 
core of the Walter Burley Griffin design vision for Canberra. It is highly significant for its symbolic 
representation of the democratic interchange between the people and their elected 
representatives and its use of the natural landforms to generate a strong planning geometry. It 
expresses a masterly synthesis and ordering of topographical features and administrative

functions to meet the needs of a national capital. The vista landscape embraces the central land 
axis and part of the water axis and most of the Parliamentary Triangle including the area known 
as the Parliamentary Zone. The significance incorporates Walter Burley Griffin’s vision for the 
area, as the focus of Commonwealth parliamentary and governmental activity as well as national 
cultural life. This vision has been partly realised and the place is the setting for major, 
government, judicial and cultural institutions. The northern extent of the vista of Anzac Parade and 
the Australian War Memorial, despite differing from the original plan, are significant for memorial 
purposes developed in response to the needs of the people. Despite being modified to a lesser 
degree to accommodate the impact of wars on Australians, the Vista now presents as a 
philosophical concept expressed in urban planning, landscape and architecture, to achieve a 
grand vision of a symbolic, unified and visually dramatic place. (Criterion F.1)
(Australian Historic Themes 7.4 Federating Australia, 8.10, Pursuing excellence in the arts and sciences)
The Parliament House Vista incorporating the central national area, is the core of the most 
ambitious and most successful example of twentieth century urban planning in Australia. It is 
important for its design pattern with large landscape and waterscape spaces with their 
enframement by treed avenues and at the lake by bridges, the terminal vista features of the 
Australian War Memorial and Mount Ainslie at the northern end and Parliament House at the 
southern end, with the Carillon and Captain Cook Jet creating balanced vertical features in the 
water plane. (Criterion F.1).
Historic Importance
The area has been associated since 1941 with the development of Australian cultural life and 
national identity through the presence of such institutions as the Australian War Memorial, the 
National Gallery of Australia, the National Science and Technology Centre and the National Library 
of Australia. The national cultural institutions reinforce the national character of the area and are 
an important symbolic group in Australia’s national cultural life. The Australian War Memorial and 
Anzac Parade memorials and, to a lesser extent, the other memorials have and continue to play a 
very important role in fostering aspects of national identity, in particular the Australian War 
Memorial through its role as a National Shrine for all Australians. (Criterion A.4, Australian Historic 
Themes, 8.8 Remembering the Fallen)
Social Importance
The area has strong and special associations with the broad Australian community because of its 
social values as a symbol of Australia and Federal Government. The values have developed over 
many years since Canberra’s creation and the relocation of the Parliament in 1927 gave them a 
special focus. The special association is reflected in the use of the area as the location for 
national memorials, the number of tourists who have and continue to visit the area, the media 
portrayal of Canberra and federal politics and the continuing use of the area as the venue for 
occasional ceremonies and political protests by sections of the community. Memorial features 
include sculptures, plaques, commemorative trees, water features and gardens. The collection of 
sculptures, associated art and design which comprise the Anzac Parade Memorials, give 
expression to key aspects of the history of Australia’s armed forces and Australia’s war 
involvement, and possess high social value. (Criterion G.1, Australian Historic Themes 8.8 
Remembering the fallen, 8.9 Commemorating significant events and people)
The special association for the community is also the use of the area by people demonstrating 
against government decisions. The central national area, particularly Parkes Place in front of 
Old Parliament House, has been used for countless demonstrations. (Criterion G.1)
The landscape spaces are important for social activities of visitors and Canberra residents and these 
include Canberra festivals, water events, national events and parades such as Anzac Day Parade and 
the Dawn Service, and other commemorative services. (Criterion G.1) 8

values related to criterion (c) Research potential identified as part of the revised assessment.
Further, the identified heritage values of the Parliament House Vista serve to emphasise the significance 
of ANZAC Parade and its association and physical location with the AWM as a key part of Canberra’s 
central designed landscape. These places, combined, possess a high degree of technical and aesthetic 
achievement, as well as symbolic content, the AWM as a National Shrine and related to the aspirations 
and central philosophies of the Australian nation.
Also pivotal to the heritage value and cultural meaning of the place are the social values of the AWM in 
its broader setting, which provides a site for the construction, maintenance and transformation of 
concepts of national identity—a place where individuals experience and reaffirm the link between 
individual and shared historic memory and the ‘imagined community’ of the nation.9

5.0 Issues and Constraints
5.1 Introduction
This section discusses the issues affecting the future conservation, management, presentation and 
interpretation of the AWM’s heritage values—both listed National and Commonwealth Heritage values, 
and other/additional values identified through the heritage values commentary in Section 4.0. It leads to, 
contextualises, and provides the justification for the management policies and processes set out in 
Section 6.0.
The key issues for the ongoing management of the AWM derive from:
•
the nature of and obligations arising from its heritage values, which are embodied in the tangible 
fabric, setting and context of the building, landscape and collections, but also in the intangible 
associations and symbolic meanings of the place;
•
the legislation that governs its management, principally the EPBC Act and its Regulations and the 
Australian War Memorial Act 1980, but also the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land 
Management) Act 1988 and the National Capital Plan (NCP);
•
the vision and priorities of the Memorial, as identified by the board and staff; and
•
the requirements and aspirations of the AWM’s users, visitors and broader stakeholder 
community.
5.2 The Legislative and Management Framework
5.2.1 Australian War Memorial Act 1980 (Cth)
The Memorial is a statutory authority within the Veterans’ Affairs portfolio and functions in accordance 
with the requirements of the Australian War Memorial Act 1980 (Cth), the Commonwealth Authorities 
Companies Act 1987 (Cth), and other applicable acts. The functions of the Memorial are set out in the 
Australian War Memorial Act 1980 as follows:
(1)The functions of the Memorial are:
(a)to maintain and develop the national memorial referred to in subsection 6(1) of the 
Australian War Memorial Act 1962 as a national memorial of Australians who have died:
(i)on or as a result of active service; or
(ii)as a result of any war or warlike operations in which Australians have been on active service;
(b)to develop and maintain, as an integral part of the national memorial referred to in 
paragraph (a), a national collection of historic material;
(c)to exhibit, or to make available for exhibition by others, historical material from the 
memorial collection or historical material that is otherwise in the possession of the 
Memorial;
(d)to conduct, arrange for and assist in research into matters pertaining to Australian history; and
(e)to disseminate information relating to:
(i)Australian military history;

Australian War Memorial—Heritage Management Plan—Revised Final Report, March 2022
(ii)the national memorial referred to in paragraph (a);
(iii)the memorial collection; and
(iv)the Memorial and its functions.
(2)The Memorial shall use every endeavour to make the most advantageous use of the 
memorial collection in the national interest.1
This legislation means that the function of the AWM as a heritage place and as an institution are clearly 
articulated in law. Any change to the use would therefore require amendment of this legislation. 
Amendments in the past have expanded the commemorative scope of the AWM, which originally 
encompassed only World War I, to include all conflicts and military service involving Australians.
The heritage management needs of the AWM as a National and Commonwealth Heritage place are 
compatible with this Act. However, the requirement for continual expansion to encompass the exhibition 
of ongoing/future military conflicts provides a tension for the management of the place, for the 
conservation of its heritage values and display of the collection as the need for exhibition, conservation 
and storage space grows.
5.2.2 Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth)
As previously explained, the AWM is a Commonwealth owned and controlled place included in the NHL 
and the CHL and is therefore subject to the provisions of the EPBC Act and the Environment Protection 
and Biodiversity Conservation Regulations 2000 (EPBC Regulations).

The EPBC Act requires Commonwealth agencies to make a plan to protect and manage the 
Commonwealth Heritage values of Commonwealth Heritage places it owns or controls. Additionally, the 
Minister for the Environment must make a plan to protect and manage the National Heritage values of 
each National Heritage place that is within a Commonwealth area, working with the relevant 
Commonwealth agency. Heritage management plans require places with Commonwealth and National 
Heritage values to be managed according to the established conservation principles of the EPBC Act. 
Schedules 5B and 7B of the EPBC Regulations set out seven Commonwealth and National Heritage 
management principles. They encourage the identification of a place’s heritage values and their 
conservation and presentation through the application of the best available skills and knowledge. They 
also encourage community (including Indigenous community) involvement and cooperation between the 
various levels of government. In addition, the principles require management of National and 
Commonwealth Heritage places to respect all heritage values of the place, not only the listed National 
and Commonwealth Heritage values.
This HMP has been prepared in accordance with the National and Commonwealth Heritage 
management principles, and with regard for matters to be addressed in Commonwealth and National 
HMPs as set out in Schedules 5A and 7A of the EPBC Regulations. The compliance of this HMP against 
Schedule 5A is provided at Appendix C.
Undertaking an Action
Under the EPBC Act, any action which has, will have or is likely to have a significant impact on a matter 
protected by the EPBC Act must not be taken without approval. Matters protected under the EPBC Act 
include Matters of National Environmental Significance (MNES), which includes the National Heritage 
values of National Heritage places, and the environment in general, for actions happening on

Commonwealth land or being undertaken by a Commonwealth agency; or the environment on 
Commonwealth land, for actions happening outside of Commonwealth land. Anyone taking an action 
which is likely to have a significant impact on these protected matters must refer the action to the 
Commonwealth Minister for the Environment for a decision on whether assessment and approval is 
required under the EPBC Act.
The EPBC Act defines the ‘environment’ to include all heritage values of a place, whether listed or not 
listed. The EPBC Act therefore requires all actions that are likely to have a significant impact on all 
Indigenous, historic and natural heritage values at the Memorial, including National Heritage values 
which have been identified as an MNES, Commonwealth Heritage values, and other heritage values at 
the site, to obtain the necessary approvals under the Act. Commonwealth Heritage values are not an 
MNES but are part of the environment on Commonwealth land.
Relevant sections of the EPBC Act include (not exclusively):
•
Section 15B related to actions with a significant impact on the National Heritage values of a 
National Heritage place.
•
Section 26 relates to actions on Commonwealth land with a significant impact on the environment.
•
Section 28 relates to actions undertaken by a Commonwealth agency (such as the Memorial) 
with a significant impact on the environment.
•
Section 341ZC requires the minimisation of adverse impacts to the heritage values of a National 
or Commonwealth Heritage place. This may be direct impacts from physical disturbance or could 
also include secondary impacts in the event of activities that would impact on the visual aspect, 
cultural importance, landscaping and curtilage of an adjacent listed property.
Self-Assessment Process and Making a Referral
A ‘significant impact’ is an impact which is important, notable, or of consequence, having regard to its 
context or intensity. Whether or not an action is likely to have a significant impact depends upon the 
sensitivity, value, and quality of the environment which is impacted, and upon the intensity, duration, 
magnitude and geographic extent of the impacts.2
When proposing to take any action, the Memorial must consider whether it will have, or is likely to have, 
a significant impact on a protected matter and therefore requires referral. In accordance with the 
Significant Impact Guidelines 1.1 Matters of National Environmental Significance and Significant Impact 
Guidelines 1.2: Actions on, or impacting upon, Commonwealth land and Actions by Commonwealth 
Agencies, this process requires the Memorial to undertake a ‘self-assessment’ to decide whether or not 
proposed actions need to be referred. The Memorial’s internal decision-making process, which is 
informed by the Significant Impact Guidelines 1.1 and 1.2, is provided in Appendix A, and the self- 
assessment form for proposed works and activities is provided in Appendix B.
The Significant Impact Guidelines 1.1 provide information about the protection of MNES matters and the 
Significant Impact Guidelines 1.2 provide information about the protection of the environment, including 
heritage values (both listed and identified), managed on Commonwealth land. The guidelines provide 
detailed explanations of the issues to be considered when determining whether an action is likely to have 
a significant impact, including issues such as the scale, duration, frequency and intensity of impacts, and 
sensitivity of the environment that will be impacted. Opportunities for the avoidance, reduction or 
management of impacts should also be sought. An action may have both beneficial and

detrimental impacts on heritage values. Only detrimental impacts are relevant when determining whether 
a referral is required.
If a referral is made, the Minister for the Environment will then consider whether the action requires 
further assessment and approval under the EPBC Act.
Three outcomes of a referral are possible:
1.
The Minister decides that the action is not likely to have a significant impact on a protected matter, 
and can go ahead without approval under the EPBC Act (‘not controlled action’).
2.
The Minister decides that an action is not likely to have a significant impact on a matter of national 
environmental significance, and does not require approval under the EPBC Act, because it will be 
taken in a ‘particular manner’. That is, the action will be undertaken in a manner that will ensure 
that any potential significant impacts are avoided or reduced by mitigation measures to the degree 
that they will not be significant. In this case, the action must be undertaken in accordance with the 
manner specified (‘not controlled action: particular manner’). This outcome is only applicable 
in a specific set of circumstances.
3.
The action is likely to have a significant impact on a protected matter, and requires approval under 
the EPBC Act (‘controlled action’).
The Minister may also determine that an action is ‘clearly unacceptable’ at the time of referral. In this 
case, the referred action would have to be withdrawn or reconsidered.
If an action is determined to be a controlled action, then an environmental assessment of the action must 
be carried out under the EPBC Act. The Minister will decide the assessment approach for the action 
from the range of assessment methods provided for under the EPBC Act. These range from the provision 
of preliminary information through to a full public inquiry (refer to Part 7 of the Act for further information 
on assessment methods).
The Minister considers the information provided through the selected assessment approach and 
determines if the action can go ahead and under what circumstances. The Minister can consider both 
detrimental environmental impacts as well as the social and economic impact of the project at this stage. 
At the end of this process the Minister can:
1.
approve the action;
2.
approve the action with conditions; or
3.
not approve the action, if the environmental impacts cannot be appropriately managed.
The AWM Heritage Strategy and Heritage Register
The Memorial is obliged, under Section 341ZA of the EPBC Act, to prepare a ‘heritage strategy’ and 
heritage register to protect and conserve the heritage values of places under its ownership and control. 
The AWM Heritage Strategy has been updated and has been reviewed by both the Department 
responsible for the EPBC Act and the Australian Heritage Council. The final document was submitted 
by the Memorial to the Commonwealth Minister for the Environment in September 2019. The AWM 
Heritage Strategy establishes the Memorial’s commitment to the ongoing heritage management of the 
AWM in accordance with the legislative requirements. It also commits the Memorial to ensuring heritage

values are considered in forward planning processes, that training in heritage management is provided 
to staff, and that the heritage values of places it owns and controls are interpreted to the public.
The AWM ‘Heritage Register’ was updated in August 2020 with the current details of the identified places 
with Commonwealth Heritage values owned and managed by the Memorial (including the Mitchell 
Precinct).
5.2.3 Statutory Listings
National Heritage Values—Protected Matter under the EPBC Act
As noted above, the EPBC Act recognises a range of protected matters that are of national 
environmental significance under the Act’s assessment and approval provisions, referred to as MNES. 
The MNES that applies to the Memorial, and the AWM, is its National Heritage values as a National 
Heritage place. A person must not take an action that has, will have, or is likely to have, a significant 
impact on a MNES without approval from the Commonwealth Minister for the Environment.
Commonwealth Heritage Place—Other Matters Protected by the EPBC Act
The CHL recognises places of Commonwealth Heritage value that are owned or controlled by the 
Commonwealth Government. The AWM is entered in the CHL and is also within the Commonwealth 
Heritage listing of the Parliament House Vista, and the requirements of the EPBC Act, outlined in brief 
above, therefore apply. The provisions of the EPBC Act protect all environments on Commonwealth 
land, including heritage under the definition of the ‘environment’ noted above.
The Parliament House Vista and Anzac Parade
As noted previously, the Parliament House Vista is a Commonwealth Heritage place that includes many 
places of individual heritage significance, including the AWM.3 It covers three separate parts of the 
Central National Area including the Parliamentary Zone, Anzac Parade and Constitution Avenue and 
Lake Burley Griffin and Foreshores, all of which are subject to detailed conditions of the NCP.
A HMP for the Parliament House Vista has been prepared for the NCA and the key policies that relate 
to the AWM are as follows:
Policy 28 Major Buildings
Key qualities of the AWM to be conserved include its:
•
landmark qualities;
•
siting;
•
contribution to the principal vista to and from Old Parliament House;
•
relative visual isolation;
•
symmetry of the building as seen from the Land Axis;
•
external form; and
•
conceptual as well as planning and landscape link between the AWM and Anzac Parade.4
The AWM is a key element of the Parliament House Vista and this gives rise to the need to consider the 
broader context and setting of all proposals or management decisions affecting the AWM.

Anzac Parade is part of the Australian War Memorial and Memorial Parade National Heritage place and 
the Parliament House Vista Commonwealth Heritage place. Anzac Parade is owned and controlled by 
the NCA. As noted previously, this HMP does not cover the Anzac Parade portion of the National 
Heritage Place.
The HMP for Anzac Parade prepared for the NCA should be considered alongside this HMP where 
necessary. Key policies that relate to the AWM are:
Policy 6 Integrated management of components
The NCA will seek to achieve integrated management between the Parade and the Australian War 
Memorial, to ensure a more consistent approach to management and commemoration, and 
engagement with and support for the armed services community.
5.2.4 Statutory Listings—ACT
ACT Heritage Register
The ACT Heritage Register legally recognises and protects significant heritage places within the ACT. 
The AWM has been nominated to the ACT Heritage Register but has not been listed. Numerous sections 
of the Parliament House Vista are included in the ACT Heritage Register. These places are all located 
on National Land under the control of the Commonwealth and, as such, the ACT Heritage Register does 
not legally apply.
5.2.5 Non-statutory Listings
Register of the National Estate
Developed in 1975, the Register of the National Estate (RNE) is no longer a statutory listing; inclusion 
on the list does not provide any legal protection or prescriptive requirements for management. The RNE 
is used as a database of identified heritage places only. However, the Minister for the Environment may 
take into account the RNE heritage values in making a decision about a referral under the EPBC Act as 
part of the heritage values of the environment. The RNE ceased to be a statutory list in February 2012. 
The AWM and Parliament House Vista are entered in the RNE.
National Trust of Australia (ACT)
The National Trust of Australia (ACT) maintains a Register of Significant Heritage Places. National Trust 
listing is not a statutory listing and has no legal effect, but is a good indication of community concern for 
a place or item. The AWM is classified on the Register of the National Trust (ACT).
Royal Australian Institute of Architects (ACT)
The AWM is included in the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA) National Heritage List and the 
RAIA Register of Significant Twentieth Century Architecture (RSTCA)—ACT List. Inclusion in the RAIA 
registers is not a statutory listing and has no legal effect, but it indicates recognition of the item’s 
architectural importance to the Australian and international architectural profession. The main Memorial 
building is recognised in the Australian Institute of Architects’ Register of Significant Twentieth Century 
Architecture.

necessity after the Commonwealth’s decision to introduce self-government to the ACT, provided for by 
the Australian Capital Territory (Self Government) Act 1988 (Cth), which established the ACT Legislative 
Assembly to govern the Territory.
The Act was designed to ensure the interests of the people of the ACT are represented and protected 
in the planning of the ACT while continuing Commonwealth involvement in the development of the 
national capital.
The Act established the NCA (previously the National Capital Planning Authority), whose functions 
include:
•
preparing, administering, reviewing and (as necessary) amending the NCP;
•
fostering awareness of Canberra as the national capital and recommending to the Minister any 
works it considers desirable to maintain or enhance the national capital’s character;
•
commissioning works in designated areas in accordance with the NCP where no other state or 
Commonwealth department or authority has the responsibility to do so; and
•
performing, with the approval of the Minister, planning services for any person or body, whether 
within Australia or overseas, and managing National Land designated in writing by the Minister as 
land required for the special purposes of Canberra as the national capital.
5.2.7 The National Capital Plan
The NCP forms the strategic planning framework for Canberra and the ACT. In accordance with Section 
10 of the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988, the NCP sets out 
detailed conditions for planning design and development for Designated Areas for which the NCA is 
responsible for planning and development approval.
A Designated Area is an area of land specified as having ‘the special characteristics of the National 
Capital’.5 The AWM is within a Designated Area—the Central National Area. It is also encompassed by 
the ‘Constitution Avenue and Anzac Parade Precinct Code’. The AWM Mitchell Precinct does not fall 
within a Designated Area.
The NCA’s aim, through the NCP, is to achieve high qualities of planning and development within a 
design context appropriate to its location. In addition, development in the ‘Central National Area’ (defined 
in the NCP) is guided by the NCA’s non-statutory ‘Griffin Legacy’ (refer below) to respect the geometry 
and intent of Walter Burley Griffin’s plan for Canberra and to maintain and enhance the city’s landscape 
character.6
The NCP includes policies for planning and development in all Designated Areas. The Memorial must 
also be aware of the policies for the areas near the AWM, including Mount Ainslie and Anzac Parade.
5.2.8 NCA Development and Works Approval within Designated Areas
Generally, in seeking works approval from the NCA for development proposals, the applicant may be 
required to provide evidence of environmental and heritage approval from the Department responsible 
for the EPBC Act.7 Therefore, given the obligations for the Memorial under the EPBC Act, seeking 
approval from the department responsible for the EPBC Act—which may be a referral under the EBPC 
Act—is advisable before lodging a formal Works Approval application with the NCA.

Australian War Memorial—Heritage Management Plan—Revised Final Report, March 2022
To minimise potential conflicting issues arising late in a project’s development or between consent 
authorities which may affect a proposal, early consultation with the NCA and the department responsible 
for the EPBC Act should occur concurrently. This may help to resolve potential issues before design and 
construction documentation becomes detailed and difficult to change. It will also assist in establishing 
the appropriate sequence of lodging an EPBC Act referral, if necessary, and the Works Approval 
application. Under the NCP, the Memorial is required to obtain works approval for:
•
all external works to the building or grounds; and
•
any works that change the landscape (eg earthworks, tree removal and replanting).8
The NCA Works Approval process does not cover:
•
internal alterations; or
•
works that may have an impact on threatened species and communities. These must be 
addressed under both the EPBC Act and the Nature Conservation Act 2014 (ACT) and 
subsequent amendments.
As part of this process, the NCA suggests that consultation be sought at an early stage of design 
development, before completing and lodging an application for Works Approval.
Formal approval from the NCA is based on construction documentation and supporting information 
submitted with the Works Approval application form and fees. The required supporting information may 
range in complexity depending on the nature of the proposal. The NCA’s information checklist is attached 
(refer to Appendix D); however, the requirements for individual projects should be confirmed with the 
NCA for each specific proposal and application.
5.2.9 National Memorials Ordinance 1928 (ACT)
The National Memorials Ordinance 1928 (ACT) provides for the location and character of national 
memorials and the naming of divisions, and public places in, the ACT. The Ordinance applies to National 
Land in the ACT—that is, land that is used by the Commonwealth. The Ordinance establishes the 
Canberra National Memorials Committee.9
All works in Designated Areas, including any commemorative works, must be approved by the NCA.10 
In planning for commemorative works, the NCA has produced ‘Guidelines for Commemorative Works in 
the National Capital’ which outline the significance of such works, the appropriate general locations 
within the Designated Areas and the approach to be taken in designing them. According to the NCA, the 
location of commemorative sites that honour military sacrifice, service and valour occur north of Lake 
Burley Griffin, including:
•
Anzac Parade—memorials that commemorate Australian Defence Force service in all wars or 
warlike operations;
•
the AWM—commemoration related to the service and sacrifice of Australians in war-like 
operations or in peace keeping;
•
Russell Precinct—commemoration related to the contribution of Defence personnel (individual or 
collective) to unique military operations or to international Defence treaties and alliances; and

•
Australian Defence Force Academy and Royal Military College, Duntroon—commemoration 
honouring graduates, staff or those who have played a significant role in the development of the 
institution, in defence education and training, or in theatres of war.
All commemorative installations at the AWM, including memorials, plaques and plantings, are associated 
with the national significance of the place. In planning for the installation of new memorials, including the 
proposed memorial to national service, the Memorial implements extensive stakeholder consultation with 
veteran and other community groups, as well as the required heritage authorities and the NCA.
The Memorial is responsible for the AWM but not Anzac Parade, which is managed by the NCA. While 
the Memorial requires works approval from the NCA for commemorative works on the AWM, apart from 
undertaking relevant stakeholder consultation, there is no requirement to make a formal referral to the 
Canberra National Memorials Committee for commemorative installations on the AWM site.
5.3 Conservation and Condition Monitoring
5.3.1 Monitoring Heritage Values
The Memorial has a set routine to ensure the regular monitoring of the condition of the facilities and 
collection. The Memorial has a schedule and system of inspections that is carried out by various 
sections. For example:
•
All plant rooms are inspected by Buildings and Services staff on a monthly basis. These 
inspections are to check for potential issues such as cracks, weeps, leaks, and vermin.
•
A crack monitoring program has been underway for many years. Due to the stable condition of 
existing building cracks, this has been extended to carrying out inspections every 5 years.
•
All Visitor Services staff are required to monitor building and collection condition for damage or 
degradation. They prepare reports that are sent to Security for processing by the appropriate 
section or area of the Memorial.
•
Security is required to monitor the condition of the buildings, grounds and collection during their 
routine area patrols and report to the Memorial on a case by case basis.
5.3.2 Approvals
The Memorial has a staged approach to undertaking works with all new work and maintenance activities, 
including those of a minor, medium or significant scale, requiring the preparation of a heritage impact 
assessment as part of the approval process. The following provides a summary of the approval process 
for different scales of new works and maintenance activities:
•
Significant new work or maintenance activities require a Submission to the Corporate 
Management Group (CMG) and this Submission must include a detailed Heritage Impact 
Assessment (HIA) before it will be considered by the CMG.
•
Medium scale new works or maintenance activities require a ‘Brief to the CMG’. The Brief must 
contain a HIA before it will be considered by the CMG.
•
Minor new works and Building & Exhibition maintenance activities both require an application, 
including a Heritage Impact Assessment (less detailed than for larger scale works/activities), to 
be prepared before the relevant Section Head will review and approve the works.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GML Heritage
10
Australian War Memorial—Heritage Management Plan—Revised Final Report, March 2022
Additionally, work that includes core drilling, digging or chasing, must include a HIA for submission to 
the Head of Buildings and Services Section.
As a final check, all works or maintenance activities are monitored by the Memorial Security Team with 
no works allowed to commence without the appropriate approvals.
The Memorial has an internal ‘Heritage Impact Self-Assessment Form’ provided in Appendix B and on 
the Memorial’s intranet.
The form can be completed by any member of the AWM staff proposing an activity that may impact the 
heritage values of AWM. Guidance can be provided by the Project Officer and Head of the Building and 
Services Section, if required. The form is to be approved by the Head of Building Services, noting that 
additional approval may be required through CMG.
The form is the first step taken in the impact assessment process, and depending on the potential for, 
or degree of, impact on the AWM’s heritage values, the Memorial may engage a heritage consultant to 
provide advice to the Memorial for mitigating impacts and preparing a HIA. Head of Building Services, 
or an external consultant may be engaged to prepare a referral under the EPBC Act if required.
5.3.3 Conservation Works
Ongoing conservation issues with the heritage fabric of the main Memorial building have been 
progressively investigated and rectified by the Memorial over the last 15–20 years, and a significant 
amount of work on the condition of the place’s fabric has been carried out by the Memorial since the 
preparation of the 2008 HMP. These include:
•
improvements to water ingress and drainage issues within the Commemorative Area courtyard, 
replacement of the guttering and drainage system behind the sandstone carved figures and 
replacement of deteriorated stonework;
•
cleaning and re-grouting of the Pool of Reflection; and
•
procurement of new bronze bracket for the Eternal Flame to rectify cracking caused by climate.
A number of the subsequent issues caused by water ingress and poor drainage have been corrected, 
such as the erosion of the sandstone carved figures. Close inspection of all stonework should be 
undertaken to identify ongoing issues with spalling, erosion or staining caused by improper drainage.
5.3.4 Structural Issues
Major rectification works including repairs to cracking in the dome, and stabilisation of the mosaics in the 
Hall of Memory, were undertaken in the late 1990s and further works to alleviate effects of settlement 
within the gallery wings were undertaken as part of the 2014 redevelopment of the First World War 
galleries. However, due to the methods of construction and materials used, movement in the structure 
may occur.
The stone cladding of the main Memorial building is also subject to cupping due to the expansion and 
contraction of the underlying brick structure. Significant rectification works to address these issues, 
including repointing and replacement of the metal fixtures embedded within the stone, has been 
undertaken.
Ongoing monitoring of the main Memorial building is required to identify long-term structural changes to 
the building and ongoing crack monitoring is being undertaken.

5.3.5 Gallery Redevelopment
As part of the First World War Gallery redevelopment (2014), physical conservation works to the space 
were carried out to retain and conserve original fabric, such as protection of original floors, exposure of 
the original ceilings, and the re-use of existing doorways and openings into the 1960 extended wings. 
The original skylights covered over were also conserved and retained behind new ceiling panels in order 
to protect the objects on display within the gallery.
Despite earlier changes to the space, the spaces retain a level of integrity in their form and finishes which 
should be respected and enhanced within any proposal for new works in these areas.
5.3.6 Maintenance
In addition to major works occurring at the AWM since 1997, many recommendations of previous 
management plans have been implemented as part of the daily conservation management to ensure the 
condition of the building is monitored and maintained on an ongoing basis. These include:
•
Four detailed maintenance contracts covering facility maintenance, facility cleaning, horticultural 
services and grounds maintenance have been implemented to specifically assess and manage 
the condition of the building and site. Performance of these contracts is overseen by the Buildings 
and Services Section, with activity and requirements reviewed monthly.
•
Regular monthly inspections of the building fabric and grounds are in place.
•
A program of ongoing crack monitoring of the main building, including the Hall of Memory, is in 
place.
•
A new AWM Standard for Design Services and Documentation has been implemented. Existing 
plans and drawings have been audited and catalogued, to ensure consistency in the production 
and archiving of building plans and project drawings.
•
An ongoing commitment to the conservation and maintenance of the surviving early building fabric 
(dating from the 1940s) including: the façade and features of the main building; early furniture and 
fitout; original floors and ceilings in the galleries; the in situ dioramas and their surrounds in the 
(former) Sinai and Palestine Galleries; the Shellal mosaic in its display niche; and the Hall of 
Memory, its dome and art works.
Inability to access parts of the main Memorial building safely reduces the AWM’s ability to actively care 
for and conserve parts of the building. Of particular note is the Shellal mosaic, built into the original 
external wall of the main Memorial building—safe access to the space is not provided for, and cleaning 
cannot be undertaken. While the mosaic is relatively stable, and protected from most environmental 
contaminants through the installation of a partition, regular monitoring and condition assessment of the 
mosaic to inspect for degradation and cracking is undertaken by the Memorial’s conservators.
5.3.7 The Condition of Non-Fabric Based Heritage Values
As discussed in Section 4.0, the AWM also possesses very significant social and cultural heritage values, 
including significant research potential. Factors to be considered to measure the condition of these 
intangible heritage values could include visitor numbers, research on the place and the collection, 
accessibility of the place and collection, and the role of the AWM in the cultural life of the national 
community. Using these terms, it would suggest that the intangible heritage values of the AWM are in 
excellent condition. The Memorial’s Annual Reports detail research outputs, visitor numbers and visitor

uses, as well as other significant outreach events undertaken by the Memorial. By any standards the 
Memorial is a vibrant cultural organisation, focused on key stakeholder and visitor needs.
5.4 Landscape
5.4.1 Tree Management
In addition to the identified values of the formal and informal landscape of the AWM as a whole, trees 
have been planted individually, and as elements within larger monuments. Of particular note is the Lone 
Pine and two Aleppo pine reserve plantings propagated from the original. The original Lone Pine, planted 
in 1934, is actively managed to ensure its longevity, with reserve plantings being established to provide 
continuity of the specimen on the site.
Other trees on the site, whilst not individually significant, also contribute to the visual setting of the main 
Memorial building, and the character of the site generally. These are also managed to ensure longevity, 
and with regard for public safety, particularly those located in high traffic areas, and species known to 
drop limbs. This requires regular checking and pruning; however, damage caused by cockatoos is 
increasing the risk of limb failure in a number of notable specimens in front of the main Memorial building.
The Tree Management Plan outlines the condition and risk associated with each tree located on the site 
and provides specific management recommendations.
The large trees in the Central Precinct of the landscape, and along pathways into the Sculpture Garden, 
inhibit security monitoring of the site in areas with CCTV video. Under lighting of large trees within the 
Eastern Precinct has been implemented to improve amenity in these areas as well as appreciation of 
the larger and more significant specimens.
The Western Precinct features mature plantings of exotic trees amongst the open lawn areas, garden 
beds and paths. Species of trees chosen in the Western Precinct are generally exotic, and complement 
the formality of the landscape, such as the two large spreading oaks. Others have symbolic associations, 
such as the Lone Pine, cherry trees surrounding the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces 
Memorial, and the silver birch behind the Australian Serviceman Memorial.11
Plantings within the Central and Eastern Precincts comprise both formal landscaped areas, such as the 
Parade Ground, and National Service Memorial, as well as informal native plantings, predominantly 
eucalypt species. Landscaping behind Poppy’s Café is planted with eucalypts of assorted species and 
ages blending this area of the site in with the backdrop of Mount Ainslie. The only identified remnant 
trees are Eucalyptus melliodora and Eucalyptus bridgesiana, yet other species have also been planted. 
There has been varying degrees of success due to the climate (including inconsistent rainfall) and wind 
tunnel conditions in this portion of the site.
5.4.2 Pests and Faunal Disturbance
The Memorial actively manages invasive species across the site. Subsidence due to extensive rabbit 
burrowing has been repaired in the area of the Administration Building in 2016. Changes to the 
landscaping within the Western Precinct have been undertaken to minimise habitats conducive to 
occupation by rabbits including the replacement of juniper bushes within the precinct with ivy, underlain 
with chicken wire. This is consistent with the plantings along Anzac Parade. While the works have

Australian War Memorial—Heritage Management Plan—Revised Final Report, March 2022
Instances of pigeons entering and landing on surfaces within the Hall of Memory have been reduced 
through the introduction of deterrents, including netting within the cupola, and spikes across surfaces.
The landscape has been subject to increased grazing by kangaroos due to drought conditions in the 
region and rising population numbers. These inhibit the Memorial’s ability to use the spaces for short- 
term events and more ephemeral memorial activities, as well as impacting the health of lawns within the 
areas of formalised landscaping. Methods for deterring the animals without fencing the site are under 
investigation.
5.4.3 The Sculpture Garden
Since opening in 1999, the Sculpture Garden has been progressively added to over time, with the recent 
addition of large objects on display along the western elevation of the main Memorial building. At the 
time of opening, the Sculpture Garden was restricted to the formalised landscape portions of the site in 
the Western Precinct. With the redevelopment of the Eastern Precinct and the construction of the 
National Service Memorial in this area, these items now extend beyond the Sculpture Garden and are 
part of the formalised landscaping across the site. The current configuration of memorials, sculptures 
and objects is documented in the Site Development Plan (refer to Section 5.8.2 below), with a further 10 
locations identified for future memorials, four additional large objects and further plaque locations.
The conservation and maintenance of individual monuments and sculptures is managed by the 
Memorial, with regular repainting of large objects.
5.5 Site Use
Previous management plans have noted change to the AWM as an ongoing part of its history, in order 
to continue serving its various functions. Conservation management planning for the place needs to take 
this history of change and development into account, balancing conservation of the elements of 
significance while recognising the need for flexibility for future change and development.
5.5.1 Change of Use—Pressure on Gallery Space
The pressure for more exhibition space to tell new stories and new perspectives of the existing collection 
continues to grow. In addition to the formal gallery spaces, circulation spaces, such as corridors and 
lobbies, are increasingly also being used for display. Visitor numbers can put pressure on the ability of 
significant heritage values and spaces in the Memorial to be accessible and perform their intended 
function.
The relocation of collection storage to the AWM Mitchell Precinct to facilitate this is a practical 
requirement of the growing pressure for space at the AWM as well as the size of the collection, and the 
modern-day requirements for caring for collections.
The removal of research and archive spaces for the creation of new exhibition spaces reduces the 
Memorial’s ability to fulfil a core function at the AWM, as outlined in the original proposal for the place: 
‘to conduct, arrange for and assist in research into matters pertaining to Australian military history’. 
Increasing use of digital technology to record and disseminate information about the collection and 
records held by the Memorial arguably allows for greater public access than ever before.
Changes to the function and fabric of the place should have regard for the sensitivity to change when 
managing pressures on gallery space. For the gallery spaces, their configuration and fabric contribute 
to the values of the place as a purpose-built repository for the AWM’s significant collection, and a place 
which provides unique and important information on Australian’s experience of war. However, there is

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GML Heritage
11
Australian War Memorial—Heritage Management Plan—Revised Final Report, March 2022
flexibility for how exhibitions are presented within these significant spaces. Other spaces, such as the 
Commemorative Area, are highly controlled to be remain symbolic in its form and as the core of the 
memorial function.
5.5.2 Increased Visitation
The AWM consistently attracts more than 800,000 general visitors per year, with significant 
anniversaries, touring exhibitions and special events generally resulting in higher visitor numbers. The 
busiest times of the year correspond to the school holidays: late December/January, April, July, and 
October.
Most visitors to the AWM are tourists on a general visit, with the highest proportion of interstate visitors 
coming from NSW, followed by Victoria. Visitation by ACT residents tended to increase for special 
events, such as a new exhibition or special event. The number of school students visiting has steadily 
increased since 2008, with almost 146,000 school visitors in 2016–2017. Major national ceremonies, 
including ANZAC Day, Remembrance Day and other commemorative services, continue to be well 
attended, with just over 210,460 people having attended commemorative ceremonies during 2016– 
2017.12
Understanding of the National and Commonwealth Heritage values of the place, and its primary purpose 
as a memorial–a National Shrine–needs to underpin decision making regarding such changes across 
the site. Increased visitor numbers can impact on heritage conservation through risks of damage to 
heritage fabric and a reduced ability to experience and appreciate the heritage values of the place due 
to poorly managed crowds. The increase in visitor numbers has implications for the conservation and 
heritage management of the AWM, which generally range from requirements for the provision of facilities 
and accessibility to all visitors, through to changes to the use and configuration of spaces to 
accommodate larger groups. At the same time, increased visitation offers an opportunity for presentation 
and communication of the heritage significance of the Memorial to a wider audience.
With growing visitor numbers, and increased use of non-gallery spaces for exhibitions, the Memorial is 
seeking to improve circulation and wayfinding within the main Memorial building. In particular, ANZAC 
Hall requires improved visibility from the Hall of Valour, to improve its connection to the main Memorial 
building and the content of its exhibitions. Future projects at the site are to consider the potential for 
increased visitation impacting the heritage values, and these should be guided by this HMP, best practice 
and EPBC Act heritage considerations, when balancing public accessibility and communication of the 
AWM’s heritage significance with the conservation of the heritage values.
5.5.3 Accessibility
The redevelopment of the Eastern Precinct, in 2011, improved accessibility of the AWM, providing 
accessible toilets, car parking, and improved gradients across the site. Within the Commemorative Area, 
a small set of stairs has been removed to further improve access to this area.
Future development at the site should seek to maintain and improve public and equitable access within 
the main Memorial building, and across the site generally.
5.6 Hazards and Risks
As a site of National and Commonwealth Heritage value, it is important that risks to the property are well 
understood and managed. The vulnerability and exposure of the site to the following natural and 
manmade hazards should be evaluated to determine the level of risk they pose to the buildings. Disaster

risk management planning should include appropriate protection of the buildings, risk management of 
activities within the buildings, and strategies for the efficient and effective evacuation of people and 
important collections.
5.6.1 Fire
The AWM is located in a bushfire prone area. The site has fire detection, suppression and warning 
systems installed throughout. These should be inspected on a regular basis to make sure they are 
functional. Staff need to know how to use the equipment, and evacuation drills should be undertaken 
regularly.
5.6.2 Leaks
With ongoing issues relating to leaking roofs and plumbing, as well as unanticipated water ingress 
caused by burst water tanks and overflowing drains, there is a risk for substantial damage to the main 
Memorial building and its contents. Any leaks detected should be investigated immediately so that 
measures can be taken to minimise damage.
5.6.3 Site Security
New baggage screening and cloaking requirements at the entry to the Commemorative Area were 
introduced in 2016. Removable benches have been installed to facilitate the process, and to avoid 
physical changes to this significant space. Long term, new security measures may be required; however, 
the introduction of new elements within this space requires careful consideration. Impacts to the physical 
configuration of the space, and the experience of visitors entering the main Memorial building and 
viewing the Commemorative Area through the flanking Menin Gate lions, should be avoided.
Security requirements to minimise unwanted parking and unauthorised vehicle access to the back of 
house areas have also been introduced through landscape elements, such as boulders and plantings, 
as well as removable bollards prohibiting unauthorised vehicle access to the front of the main Memorial 
building and other key entry points.
Vandalism within the Sculpture Garden has occurred, and upgrades to security infrastructure across the 
grounds undertaken. New integrated light and CCTV poles are progressively being installed as required, 
to improve surveillance.
Regular security risk reviews are undertaken to ensure a strengthened focus on AWM security 
arrangements.
5.6.4 Services and Infrastructure
Major redevelopment of the galleries and site has occurred, requiring power and cooling infrastructure 
upgrade and replacement. Improvements to energy management and efficiency have been made whilst 
providing the required temperature and humidity for collection storage and management. The increasing 
volume and complexity of technologies used within the galleries and back of house areas are also 
required to facilitate the changing methods of display in contemporary galleries. In addition to these, 
provision of environmental conditions suitable for increased visitation numbers would require more 
internal space for the provision of server banks, cable tracks and power infrastructure. The colocation of 
services in the vicinity of exhibitions is considered a priority by the memorial.
Ongoing works to remove or reposition inappropriate added elements and additions to the external fabric 
of the main Memorial building are being undertaken. Works to improve the visitor experience, such as

lighting of the courtyard and installation of WiFi transmitters, have been undertaken, but need to be 
balanced with the overall appearance of this highly significant space. Opportunities to improve the 
integration of these elements are actively considered by the Memorial staff in decision making regarding 
the location and appearance of such works.
5.6.5 Ongoing Management Issues
The Heritage Strategy defines the Memorial’s coordinated approach to values-based management when 
considering proposals and actions with the potential to impact on the heritage values. Values-based 
management involves key staff from across the organisation and integrates heritage management into 
the existing day-to-day management processes. Any participatory heritage management process (such 
as that described here) demands ongoing staff training and capacity building in this area.
A consistent approach to ongoing monitoring, review and compilation of the results, findings and 
outcomes should continue to be collated as part of the Heritage Register for the AWM, so that the results 
of conservation work undertaken at the AWM are accessible to managers.
The Shellal mosaic, displayed in its specially designed niche, is a significant, surviving original feature 
of the main Memorial building. However, its collection and return to Australia in 1918 as a trophy of war 
has been questioned since its discovery and removal from the ruins of a church near Gaza. The 
significance of the Shellal mosaic, and its inclusion in the Memorial’s collection, should be considered 
as part of decisions to display, retain or remove the mosaic. If remaining on display the way in which the 
mosaic, its origins and contemporary cultural connotations are interpreted to the public require careful 
consideration. The Shellal mosaic at its display location is physically integrated into the fabric of the 
Memorial building, built into the original external wall. Consequently, removal of the Shellal mosaic from 
display may have a significant physical impact on the main Memorial building, through possible impacts 
to the structural stability of the eastern wall of the main building, or vibrational impact on other elements 
of the building. Any removal would require careful consideration and specialist advice on the possible 
options to be explored in this process, such as closing the display niche, display of a replica, or 
installation of an alternative display in the niche.
5.7 Indigenous Cultural Issues and Consultation
One Aboriginal site, an isolated Aboriginal stone artefact (AWM 1), was identified at the AWM in 2008, 
in conjunction with local Aboriginal community representatives. This find was in a disturbed context and 
the extensive modifications to the landscape of the AWM mean that there is little potential for further or 
in situ Aboriginal archaeological evidence to survive on the site. As an isolated, residual surface find in 
a disturbed context, the management of this single artefact in situ, in a highly used landscape, is unlikely 
to be feasible in even the short term.
Whilst Indigenous cultural values have not been identified with specific regard to the AWM, consultation 
with the Indigenous community representatives may be required when works are proposed at the AWM. 
Indigenous Heritage values and sensitivities should be considered and protected as part of the 
environment of the AWM, even if they may not be included in the official Commonwealth or National 
heritage values of the place. The possibility of impacts on potential Indigenous heritage values should 
therefore be considered when undertaking works at the site.
The Memorial understands that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are the primary source of 
information on their cultural heritage and therefore, are consulted on matters that may affect places that 
have cultural heritage values.

Australian War Memorial—Heritage Management Plan—Revised Final Report, March 2022
One of the Memorial’s key corporate documents is the Reflect Reconciliation Action Plan (RAP) 2015– 
2016, which facilitates the Memorial’s engagement and reconciliation with Indigenous Australians and 
seeks to enhance, respect and promote sustainable opportunities within the Memorial’s remit for 
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.13
Through its RAP, the Memorial has committed to appropriate Indigenous consultation, representation 
and awareness promotion in all areas of the Memorial’s operation including heritage. The Memorial has 
sought to rectify the historical exclusion of Indigenous Australian veterans, and to recognise the 
association of contemporary Indigenous Australian communities with the AWM. This includes the 
employment of an Indigenous Liaison Officer, research into Indigenous service in Australia’s armed 
forces, specific projects during the First World War centenary period, such as the temporary and touring 
exhibition For Country, For Nation and the installation and dedication of the For Our Country sculpture 
on 28 March 2018.
This is consistent with the AWM Heritage Strategy (September 2019).
5.7.1 Indigenous Stakeholder Consultation
The Memorial recently commissioned the design and construction of ‘For Our Country’, which is a 
memorial commemorating the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander military personnel who have served 
in war. It is located in the Sculpture Garden.
For Indigenous cultural heritage matters, the Memorial consults with Indigenous stakeholders in 
accordance with the Ask First and Engage Early guidelines. In the ACT there are four Representative 
Aboriginal Organisations (RAOs) with whom consultation should be undertaken for heritage related 
projects. These RAOs are:
•
Buru Ngunawal Aboriginal Corporation;
•
King Brown Tribal Group;
•
Mirrabei (formerly known as Little Gudgenby River Tribal Council); and
•
Ngarigo Currawong Clan.
Consultation was recently undertaken with local Indigenous stakeholders in the preparation of this HMP.
5.8 Future Proposals
5.8.1 Gallery Masterplanning
The Memorial is currently undertaking a range of masterplanning exercises to manage the range of 
pressures currently faced at the site and ensure the future needs of the organisation are able to be met 
within the operational and heritage constraints of the site. This includes the preparation of a site 
masterplan for the AWM as a whole, and a Gallery Masterplan which will address the continued growth 
in visitor numbers, changing methods of display and storytelling, increasing number of exhibitions 
required and future growth of the collection and its storage requirements.
As noted elsewhere in this HMP, the National and Commonwealth Heritage values of the place, and the 
regulations of the EPBC Act, underpin decision making regarding such changes across the site.

5.8.2 Site Development Plan Review
The Site Development Plan Review 2017 (SDP) draws upon an earlier National Capital Plan Site Master 
Plan and was endorsed by the Memorial’s Council as a strategic document providing the overall vision 
and guidance for future site developments. The SDP provides guidance for future planning and 
development at the Memorial, and functions alongside other management documents, including this 
Heritage Management Plan, to provide guidance for the site.
The SDP provides ‘Site Development Principles’ to guide how the Memorial might address a range of 
functional and operational site issues such as circulation, security, lighting, orientation and signage and 
outdoor furniture. It also provides a preliminary analysis of possible future building development sites 
and guides the placement and design principles for new memorials (commemorative works) within the 
Memorial’s landscape.
The site has continued to develop in accordance with the SDP, to accommodate functional requirements 
and the on-going growth of the national collection, public programs, commemorative ceremonies, 
increased visitation and evolving community expectations for site amenity, security and accessibility.
5.9 AWM Development Project
As part of the Memorial’s business development planning, it was granted funds from the Australian 
Government for the expansion of gallery spaces to improve and modernise the existing buildings and 
generally enhance visitor experience at the AWM. Major works to the AWM are due to commence both 
internally and externally as a series of projects, including:
•
removal and replacement of the current ANZAC Hall for additional gallery space;
•
new Glazed Link connection the main Memorial building to expanded gallery space to the north 
(the new ANZAC Hall);
•
a new southern entrance to improve visitor orientation and provide additional gallery spaces;
•
new extension and refurbishment to CEW Bean Building to consolidate operational and non- 
critical administration functions out of the main Memorial building and include a new research 
centre;
•
internal refurbishment works to the main Memorial building including modern conflict galleries;
•
design changes to the layout and landscape of the Parade Ground;
•
additional car parking to the east of Poppy’s Café carpark; and
•
landscaping works that address accessibility constraints, enhance site security and re-profile the 
parade ground.
5.9.1 Assessment Process
The development project, explained in Section 2.5 by the Memorial, was referred for consideration under 
the EPBC Act and received approval with conditions in December 2020 from the Minister for the 
Environment. The approval conditions include ensuring design details are consistent with the heritage 
values of the AWM and Memorial Parade and Parliament House Vista as well as the National and 
Commonwealth Heritage Principles; undertaking design and engineering decisions (such as for the 
construction of the new Anzac Hall and Glazed Link) to minimise the impact on the heritage values of

the site; conserving and reinstating original heritage fabric, undertaking archival recording of the site 
prior to and during construction, and maintaining records of compliance with these conditions. The full 
approval conditions are included at Appendix K. In June 2021, the NCA provided approval for early works 
associated with the development, including demolition of Anzac Hall, excavation works, services 
relocation, temporary fencing and tree removal in the grounds of the AWM.
In addition, each phase of the development project is subject to heritage assessment and approval in 
accordance with the Memorial’s internal approvals process (see Section 5.3.2).
5.9.2 Development Project—HMP Compliance
The development project must be undertaken in accordance best-practice heritage considerations, and 
should be guided by the need to conserve and manage the nationally significant heritage values of the 
AWM. As the development project is implemented, this HMP should serve as a guide for management 
and decision-making, to provide context and support to the implementation of the project and its approval 
conditions. In particular the project should be undertaken in compliance with Policies 2.7, 2.8, 3.1 and
3.5 as stated at Section 6 of this HMP.
After the completion of the development works or at five years from approval of this HMP, whichever is 
earlier, a review and update of this HMP should be prepared to reflect the changes to the site and an 
updated understanding of the heritage values. Actions on the site which are separate to the development 
should continue to be managed in accordance with this HMP.
5.9.3 Development Project—EPBC Act Approval Conditions
The development project should comply with all conditions of approval for undertaking work that may 
result in extensive change. In particular, the project must comply with all conditions required under the 
approval decision for EPBC Act Referral 2019/8574. The complete set of conditions, as varied 27 May 
2021, is provided at Appendix K.
The Memorial is required to publish online an annual report against its EPBC Conditions each September 
and submit this report to the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment for review. The 
annual report will clearly outline how the Memorial has met each obligation outlined in the condition for 
the reporting year.
Additionally the Department may choose to undertake an audit of the Development Project’s adherence 
to the EPBC conditions at any time; the results of any such audit would be made public at the 
Department’s discretion.
5.10 Conclusions
The range of National, Commonwealth and other identified heritage values of the AWM gives rise to 
EPBC Act obligations for conservation, protection, management and interpretation, and compliance with 
the relevant legislation, as discussed above.
Effective stakeholder consultation in decision making regarding the future management of the AWM is 
needed throughout the development of future works.
The implementation of the major projects, the SDP and any other future developments must reflect the 
importance of the National Shrine and unique qualities of the place. The future management and design 
development of the AWM and its broader setting will be an ongoing, dynamic process, responding to 
changing community needs and aspirations. As the AWM undergoes significant changes as part of the

6.0 Conservation Policy
Conservation policy is based on the principles embodied in the Burra Charter, a set of principles, 
processes and guidelines for best practice in heritage conservation developed by Australia ICOMOS 
(International Council of Monuments and Sites) and based on international standards.
The management and conservation policies identified in this section define how the conservation of the 
AWM’s heritage values—both official, listed National and Commonwealth Heritage values, and other, 
additional values identified in Section 4.0—identified values should be achieved. Implementation of these 
policies will also ensure the Memorial fulfils its obligations under the EPBC Act.
The tables in Section 6.2 identify general heritage conservation policies and actions for the AWM. 
Section 6.3 presents specific policies and actions for individual components of the AWM with specific 
requirements such as the Commemorative Area, Galleries and Landscape.
The use of these tools will assist in administering policy for conservation of the AWM’s heritage values. 
Managers will also need to ensure that proposals are not inconsistent with relevant policies in the 
Parliament House Vista and ANZAC Parade HMPs.
6.1 Implementation of the Conservation Policies and Actions
6.1.1 Timing/Priority
Timing parameters have been established for the implementation of policies and actions in line with their 
priority, based on the different levels of risk to the site’s heritage significance.
Implementation should be completed:
•
immediately upon adoption of the HMP (within 12 months);
•
annually;
•
on an ongoing basis;
•
within two–three years;
•
within five–10 years; or
•
as required.
6.1.2 Responsibilities
The key responsibility for implementation, review and monitoring of the HMP lies with the Memorial’s 
Corporate Services Branch and the Buildings and Services Section. This Section is responsible for the 
management and maintenance of the buildings and grounds, including conservation works. While all 
sections at the Memorial are responsible for legislative compliance with regard to heritage matters, the 
Building and Services Section provides support and guidance. The Memorial’s CMG oversees the 
implementation of the documentation.
However, all groups of the Memorial including Public Programs, National Collection and Corporate 
Services, should adopt the policies and decision-making processes of the HMP and develop an 
understanding of the AWM’s heritage values.

6.2 Key Objective of the General Conservation Policy
Schedules 5A and 7A of the EPBC Regulations item (a) requires that government ‘establish objectives 
for 
the 
identification, 
protection, 
conservation, 
presentation 
and 
transmission 
of 
the 
National/Commonwealth Heritage values of the place’. This HMP has been prepared to manage the 
National and Commonwealth Heritage values of the AWM, and those values identified through the 
heritage values commentary in Section 4.0. The key objective of this conservation policy is to ensure the 
conservation, management and interpretation of these heritage values of the AWM in the context of its 
ongoing use, development and evolution as the place of the National Shrine, an integral part of the 
symbolic landscape of the National Capital, and one of Australia’s most significant cultural sites.
AWM Development Project
The AWM development project (discussed at Sections 2.5 and 5.9) has been approved under the EPBC 
Act with conditions, and has been subject to rigorous consideration of the impacts of the proposed action 
and the heritage values of the site. The project is required to be undertaken in accordance with its 
approval conditions, which provide a framework for management of heritage impacts specifically 
associated with the development project. The conditions provide guidance for the conservation and 
management of the Memorial’s heritage values while undertaking the project. The full conditions for the 
project are included at Appendix K.
In instances where the approval conditions do not cover conservation or management issues associated 
with the development, the policies below should be used to guide decision-making. Actions on the site 
which are separate to the development project should continue to be managed in accordance with this 
section of the HMP.

Australian War Memorial—Heritage Management Plan—Revised Final Report, March 2022
7.0 Key Conclusions of the HMP
The key objective of this HMP is to ensure the conservation, management and interpretation of the 
heritage values of the AWM in the context of its ongoing use, development and evolution as Australia’s 
National Shrine, an integral part of the symbolic landscape of the national capital, and one of Australia’s 
most significant cultural sites.
Guidance for Heritage Management
•
The policies provide the future direction for management of the National, Commonwealth and 
additional identified heritage values of the AWM. They outline approaches to the conservation, 
maintenance, and monitoring of the heritage values.
•
The EPBC Act requires that a self-assessment process be established to make decisions about 
the potential for significant adverse impact on the heritage values. Appendix A, the decision- 
making framework, and Appendix B, the assessment form, will assist the Memorial in making 
decisions about impacts on heritage values and in documenting this process.
Guidance for Future Development
•
The HMP provides a framework to conserve, protect and manage the heritage values of the AWM. 
Through this framework, it provides heritage guidance for decision-making on forward planning, 
design development and future developments at the AWM.
•
The HMP, best heritage practice and compliance with the obligation of the EPBC Act must be 
followed when planning and implementing any new work or major projects including the 
implementation of the Site Development Plan and expansions associated with new gallery space.
•
Understanding of the National and Commonwealth Heritage values of the place, and its primary 
purpose as a National Shrine, needs to underpin decision making regarding the potential for future 
development.
•
The HMP establishes the need for any development on the site to be assessed in terms of its 
potential to impact upon, or positively contribute to, the heritage values of the AWM, the 
Parliament House Vista and Griffin Land Axis.
•
The HMP policies are intended to provide guidance for design development of any new works at 
the AWM as well as the need for consultation with key stakeholders and specific approvals under 
the EPBC Act and National Capital Plan.
Guidance for Stakeholder Consultation
•
The Memorial should consult widely when proposing changes with the potential to impact on the 
heritage values of the place, given it has National Heritage value and cultural significance.
•
The Memorial should utilise a variety of communication and marketing channels to communicate 
and engage with stakeholder groups.

Australian War Memorial—Heritage Management Plan—Revised Final Report, March 2022
Guidance for Ongoing Monitoring and Reporting
•
The Memorial should monitor and re-evaluate the condition of the place’s heritage values as part 
of the review of the HMP at five years or on completion of major works such as the development 
project. Monitoring will need to be undertaken on an annual basis to demonstrate the 
implementation of the HMP and to identify trends and refine management techniques accordingly.
Guidance for Interpretation of the Heritage Values
•
The HMP recommends the preparation of an Interpretation Plan which develops approaches to 
presenting and conveying the heritage values of the place to the broader public.
•
The Memorial should use a range of media to interpret the heritage values of the place, including 
online material, published material and signage. The Memorial should interpret the unique 
relationship between the collection, the buildings, the artworks and the place, which all combine 
to constitute the place’s National Heritage value.
Responsibilities for Implementation
•
The key responsibility for implementation of the HMP lies with the Buildings and Services Section 
within the AWM Corporate Services Branch. However, all groups of the Memorial including Gallery 
Development, Public Programs, National Collection and Corporate Services, should adopt the 
policies and decision-making processes of the HMP and develop an understanding of the place’s 
heritage values.

Appendix B—Heritage Impact Self-Assessment Form
Introduction
The Australian War Memorial (AWM) is a place included in both the National Heritage List (NHL) and the 
Commonwealth Heritage List (CHL). This means it is protected under the Environment Protection and 
Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Cth) (EPBC Act). As a National Heritage place, the AWM is also 
considered a matter of national environmental significance (MNES).
As an organisation, the Memorial has a responsibility to protect the National and Commonwealth Heritage 
values by making sure that all AWM staff and contractors avoid impacts to the heritage values.
Information about the heritage values of the AWM and their management can be found in the Heritage 
Strategy, the Heritage Register and the Heritage Management Plan. These documents can be found on the 
Memorial’s Intranet under the Buildings & Services Section.
This form is to be completed when any works or activities (known as an ‘action’) are proposed at the AWM 
that may have an impact to the heritage values. It describes the type of action being undertaken, identifies 
the heritage values that may be affected by the action and outlines the measures being undertaken to avoid 
or lessen any impacts.
Completing this form is an important step in meeting the Memorial’s legislative obligation to identify if an 
action has, will have, or is likely to have a ‘significant impact’ on the Commonwealth and/or National Heritage 
values of the AWM. A significant impact is described in further detail below.
However, completing this form is not the only step. If, after completing this form, a ‘significant impact’ is 
identified as a possibility, a Heritage Impact Assessment (HIA) should be prepared by a qualified heritage 
practitioner familiar with the EPBC Act. Once completed, this form is to be submitted to the Head, Buildings 
and Services for initial assessment and advice.
What is an ‘action’?
An action is defined in the EPBC Act as ‘a project, a development, an undertaking, an activity or a series of 
activities, or an alteration of any of these things.’ Sometimes, these actions can be obvious, such as:
•
refurbishment;
•
construction;
•
demolition;
•
alterations and modifications;
•
maintenance;
•
infrastructure works; and
•
landscape works.
Other times, these actions can be less obvious, such as activities or works that are visual rather than 
physical, temporary rather than permanent or that result in a change in use. All aspects of an action should 
be considered when assessing if there may be an impact to the heritage values, such as site preparation, 
access and decanting.
It is important to note that an action should be considered at its broadest possible scope when assessing 
the potential to impacts to the heritage values.
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What is a ‘significant impact’?
Under the EPBC Act, the Memorial has a responsibility to avoid impacts to the environment. Heritage values 
are included in the EPBC definition of the environment.
A ‘significant impact’ is defined as an impact to the environment that is ‘important, notable, or of 
consequence, having regard to its context or intensity’. If an action is likely to have a significant impact, this 
triggers the need to submit a ‘referral’ to the Department responsible for the EPBC Act. Before a referral is 
made, a HIA should be prepared and submitted with the referral.
Please note that approval of this form constitutes an internal approval only and does not necessarily 
constitute approval under any legislation. AWM staff should be aware that other statutory approvals may be 
required, or the advice of an external heritage consultant sought. This form does not constitute a HIA.
National Capital Authority Works Approval
The AWM is located within a Designated Area, which are managed by the National Capital Authority (NCA). 
A Designated Area is an area within the ACT has been identified as having the ‘special characteristics of 
the National Capital’.
In accordance with the Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 (Cwth) (the 
PALM Act), the NCA is required to approve all ‘works’ within the Designated Areas. Any alteration to 
buildings or structures, demolition, landscaping or excavation works in these Designated Areas require the 
prior written approval of the NCA or 'Works Approval'. There are no exemptions for Works Approval under 
the PALM Act.
Potential impact to heritage values is one aspect of a Works Approval application that the NCA will consider. 
For further information on NCA Works Approval and the National Capital Plan, refer to the Planning & 
Heritage section of the NCA’s website: https://www.nca.gov.au/planning-heritage.

Summary Statement of Significance:
The Australian War Memorial (AWM) is Australia's national shrine to those Australians who 
lost their lives and suffered as a result of war. As such it is important to the Australian 
community as a whole and has special associations with veterans and their families including 
the Returned & Services League of Australia. These special associations are reinforced on 
ANZAC Day and at ceremonies specific to particular memorials on Anzac Parade.
The AWM in its setting was a direct consequence of the First World War, one of the seminal 
events in Australian history. Official war correspondent, Charles Bean, believed that the war 
would have a strong influence on the creation of a sense of nationhood and a distinctly 
Australian character and identity. Bean’s vision of a war memorial as a place to house the 
objects made sacred by their direct association with the events and sacrifice of Australians at 
war was embodied in the establishment of the AWM. A purpose built repository, the AWM is a 
place where the nature of commemoration was based on an integral relationship between 
the building, commemorative spaces and the collections of objects and records. This is rare 
in Australia and uncommon in the world. The AWM has a unique and important function in 
collecting and displaying objects and records of Australians’ experience of war. It has the 
potential to yield information that will contribute to Australia’s social, political and military 
history.
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The role of the AWM with its central location in the nation’s capital is an important landmark 
in Australia and a popular national icon. Although the AWM was not part of the original 
design for Canberra, Walter Burley Griffin agreed that it would be a fitting structure for its 
prominent position. The surrounding landscape design, indigenous and exotic plantings and 
setting and sympathetic location of associated structures and the symmetry of land axis have 
maintained the importance of the views of the AWM and its dominance in the landscape. As 
the terminating building at the northern end of the land axis of Griffin's plan for Canberra, 
the AWM makes a major contribution to the principal views from both Parliament Houses and 
from Mount Ainslie. Major features of the original site include: the main building; the 
external fabric; the ceremonial landscape including indigenous and exotic plantings 
immediately in front of the main building; the Lone Pine tree; and displays and sculptures. 
The Hall of Memory with the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier and in conjunction with 
aspects of its setting, demonstrates changing and evolving concepts of commemoration. The 
courtyard and its honour colonnade, the reflection pool and plantings contribute to its 
outstanding significance.
The AWM in its setting is of outstanding importance for its aesthetic characteristics. The 
place is highly valued for its great beauty by the Australian community and veteran groups. 
The main building and the surrounding landscape, the Hall of Memory, the Roll of Honour, 
ANZAC Hall and the collections act as reminders of important events and people in Australia's 
history. The AWM triggers disturbing and poignant responses from the vast majority of 
visitors and has also inspired artistic works such as paintings and photographs.
The AWM and Anzac Parade have special associations with Australia’s military forces and 
with veterans as represented by the Returned & Services League of Australia and community 
groups. Anzac Parade was opened on ANZAC Day 1965, the fiftieth anniversary of the 
landing of the ANZAC's at Gallipoli. It is the setting for a series of memorials 
commemorating Australian service and sacrifice in war and is the major national venue for 
the ANZAC Day march and other ceremonies to commemorate those who served Australia in 
times of conflict. Anzac Parade, as part of the Parliamentary Vista and as an extension of the 
AWM, has a deep symbolism for many Australians, and has become part of one of the major 
cultural landscapes of Australia. The notion of a ceremonial space of this grandeur is not 
found elsewhere in Australia and Anzac Parade is nationally important for its public and 
commemorative functions. The memorials along Anzac Parade also demonstrate changing 
and evolving concepts of commemoration, under the influence of veteran, community and 
migrant groups and the armed forces. The AWM has special associations with Charles Bean, 
John Treloar and Sir Henry Gullett who contributed to building the national identity through 
their work.

Official Values:
Criterion: A Events, Processes
The AWM is an outstanding national museum and memorial, as expressed through the 
main building, the courtyard fabric, interior spaces, the Sculpture Garden and the 
collections. The AWM was established as a direct consequence of the First World War, 
one of the seminal events in Australian history. It embodied the vision of Charles Bean 
– Official First World War correspondent – that the war would be instrumental in 
creating a sense of nationhood and a distinctly Australian identity. The institution plays 
a pivotal role in helping Australians to commemorate and understand the sacrifice and 
loss of Australians during war.
The AWM together with Anzac Parade is an important national icon. Its major features 
include: the main building; the medieval stone lions at the entrance; the ceremonial 
landscape including the Lone Pine tree; and displays and sculptures. The AWM and 
Anzac Parade are major venues for national commemorative services and events such 
as the ANZAC Day march.
Anzac Parade, as part of the Parliamentary Vista and an extension of the AWM, is part 
of one of the major designed landscapes of Australia. A ceremonial space of this 
grandeur is unique in Australia.
The AWM and the memorials along Anzac Parade represent changing concepts of 
commemoration in Australia, influenced by the armed forces and community groups. 
The Hall of Memory with the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier, and aspects of its 
setting
are notable.
Criterion: B Rarity
The AWM building is a purpose built repository, reflecting the integral relationship 
between the building, commemorative spaces and the collections. This is unique in 
Australia and rare elsewhere in the world. The values are expressed in the fabric of the 
main building, the entrance, the Hall of Memory, the collections and the surrounding 
landscape.
The AWM collection contains unique objects including a Lancaster bomber and the 
largest collection of Victoria Crosses in the world. The building contains rare elements, 
notably the medieval stone lions at the entrance and the Hall of Memory with its largest 
mosaics in the world.
Anzac Parade, as part of the Parliamentary Vista and as an extension of the AWM, is 
part of one of the major cultural landscapes of Australia. The grandeur of the 
ceremonial space is not found elsewhere in Australia. Anzac Parade is nationally 
important for its public and
commemorative functions.
Criterion: C Research
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The AWM has a unique and important function in the nation in collecting and displaying 
objects and records on Australians’ experience of war. The AWM and other institutions 
have used these materials to produce research on social, political and military history. 
The place has the potential to yield further substantial information on Australians’ 
experience of war. These values are expressed through the collections.
Criterion: E Aesthetic characteristics
The AWM in its setting is of outstanding importance for its aesthetic characteristics, 
valued as a place of great beauty by the Australian community and veteran groups (as 
represented by the Returned & Services League of Australia). The place has evoked 
strong emotional and artistic responses from Australian and overseas visitors. The main 
building and the surrounding landscape, the Hall of Memory, the Roll of Honour, ANZAC 
Hall and the collections act as reminders of important events and people in Australia's 
history and trigger disturbing and poignant responses from the vast majority of visitors.
The AWM together with Anzac Parade form an important national landmark that is 
highly valued by the Australian community. As part of the Parliamentary Vista, the 
AWM makes a major contribution to the principal views from both Parliament Houses 
and Mount Ainslie. Views from Anzac Parade to the Hall of Memory, and from the Hall of 
Memory along the land axis are outstanding. Its prominent position is important due to 
its relative visual isolation on the Griffin land axis, amid the backdrop of the forested 
slopes of Mount Ainslie. The visual impact of the AWM when viewed from Parliament 
House and other points along Griffin's land axis including Mount Ainslie; and the fabric 
of Anzac Parade including the memorials, plantings and lighting is far more distinctive 
and dramatic compared to the other principal war memorials in Australia.
Criterion: G Social value
The AWM is the national war museum and national shrine, and together with Anzac 
Park, has special associations for the Australian community, particularly veterans and 
their families. These special associations are reinforced on ANZAC Day and at 
ceremonies specific to particular memorials on Anzac Parade. The AWM and the Anzac 
Parade memorials are the nation’s major focal point for commemoration including the 
ANZAC Day march and other ceremonies and events. These values are expressed 
through: the AWM building (including the Hall of Memory); the collection; the 
surrounding landscape (including the Sculpture Garden); and Anzac Parade including 
the memorials.
Criterion: H Significant people
The AWM building and the Anzac Parade memorials have special associations with 
Australia’s military forces and veterans represented by the Returned & Services League 
of

Australia.
The AWM's success as a shrine, a museum, an architectural form and part of Canberra's 
urban plan is partly the result of its special associations with the lives and works of people 
who have been significant in Australia's history. These include the AWM’s founders 
Charles Bean, John Treloar and Sir Henry Gullett.
The values are expressed in the fabric of the place which includes: the main building; the 
Hall of Memory; the collections; the surrounding landscape; and Anzac Parade.
Description:
Planning context
Griffin’s plans for the central national area of Canberra included a basic framework which 
survives to the present. An alignment of land and water axes and avenues defined Griffin's city 
plan. The axes together with the triangle bounded by Commonwealth Avenue, Constitution 
Avenue and Kings Avenue were the basic elements that established Canberra's geometric 
design pattern. The design represented Griffin's interpretation of democracy and created three 
urban centres connected by its main avenues: Capital Hill as the place for the people; Mount 
Vernon as the municipal centre; and Mount Pleasant as the market centre. The northern 
avenue, Constitution Avenue, was the municipal axis. The AWM is located at the northern end 
of the land axis, the major planning axis that runs from Parliament House, through Federation 
Mall and Parkes Place and along Anzac Parade to Mount Ainslie. The AWM has an elevated 
position at the end of Anzac Parade and is framed by Mount Ainslie in the background. It is a 
powerful form within the axial landscape of Canberra (Pearson & Crocket 1995: 42-44; 
Freeman, 2004: 4). Australian planners have followed Griffin’s vision but with minor changes in 
terms of impact to reflect historical events and Australian political and social life.
Australian War Memorial
The site of the AWM is the area bounded by Limestone Avenue, Fairbairn Avenue and Treloar 
Crescent. The AWM is part of a larger landscape which is structured by Griffin’s land axis and 
includes Anzac Park, Anzac Parade, Remembrance Park on the slopes of Mount Ainslie behind 
the AWM, Mount Pleasant and Black Mountain. The AWM is closely associated with memorials 
along Anzac Parade that commemorate important aspects of Australia's involvement in war.
The AWM is a unique commemorative institution that functions as a memorial, a museum, an 
archive and a centre for research. The complex includes commemorative areas, a Sculpture 
Garden, gallery exhibits, research facilities, an administration building and a kiosk. The major 
commemorative spaces are the grand entrance, the central courtyard and Pool of 
Remembrance, the flanking cloisters with the Roll of Honour and the copper domed Hall of
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Memory.
The main building is stone faced, designed in the art deco style and has a cruciform plan with 
two floors of galleries, a library, war records storage, office space and workshop facilities. 
The building displays Byzantine modelling in its interpenetrating forms and the front 
entrance shows Egyptian influences in its pylons and massing. Important features of the 
style include: a stepped skyline; concentration of ornament on the upper part of the 
building; a tower feature; and a monumental entrance. Two medieval stone lions, donated 
by the city of Ypres in 1936, are located in the entrance area. The lions previously stood at 
the gateway of the Menin road at Ypres and were damaged during the First World War. The 
Hall of Memory, with its stepped cubic forms and copper dome, is the key architectural and 
landmark element of the place. As the major vertical element in the architectural 
composition, it closes the view from within the courtyard and is a prominent terminating 
feature of the land axis and Canberra’s landscape setting. The mosaics and stained glass 
windows within the hall are outstanding pieces of monumental applied art in the art deco 
style. The Roll of Honour is an important historical monument and visual statement of 
Australians who died in war. It is a key element of the founding concept for the AWM, even 
though it was not installed until the 1960s.
Hall of Memory
The Hall of Memory is an important symbolic space in the AWM comprising several 
outstanding pieces. It was originally conceived by Sodersteen as containing a roll of honour 
but funds were not available to build a dome that could house all the names. The design 
was amended to include the names in a commemorative courtyard. In 1937 the AWM Board 
agreed to complete the hall by installing a sculpture, stained glass windows and mosaics. 
Designed by Napier Waller, the windows reflect the First World War and the mosaics on the 
dome pendentives represent the four arms of the services, including women's services. The 
mosaic inside the dome depicts the souls of the dead rising from the earth towards their 
spiritual home, represented by a glowing sun within the Southern Cross. The figures on the 
walls – a soldier, a sailor, an airman and a servicewoman – recall the Australian experience 
of the Second World War. Over six million pieces of glass tesserae, or tiles, imported from 
Italy, were used in the composition; the installation was overseen by Italian craftsmen and 
took three years to complete. Leslie Bowles was commissioned for the sculpture but his 
designs were all rejected before he passed away. Ray Ewers later produced a statue of a 
young soldier which was installed in 1955. The statue was removed and relocated in the 
Sculpture Garden in 1993 to accommodate the new Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier. 
Four pillars behind the tomb, designed by Janet Lawrence, represent the ancient elements of 
earth, air, fire and water, symbolising the variety of terrain and climate where Australians 
served and
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
died. The hall has since functioned as a mausoleum, as a quiet place for contemplation of the 
efforts of ordinary Australians in war and remembrance of those who suffered and died 
(Pearson & Crocket 1995: 19-24).
Courtyard and Roll of Honour
The courtyard with its cloisters, Roll of Honour and Pool of Reflection evolved from Crust's 
design collaboration with Sodersteen. A stepped granite cascade designed by Robert 
Woodward was added at the northern end of the pool in 1980 and this was replaced in 1988 
by an eternal flame. At the southern end of the pool is the Inauguration Stone and the 
courtyard is flanked with twenty-six carved sandstone gargoyles designed by Bowles. The 
Roll of Honour was completed in 1967 and contains the names of over 120,000 Australians 
killed in war, from the Sudan in 1855 to the Vietnam War in the 1970s. A Commemorative 
Book was established in 1975 to list Australians who died as a result of any war. Between 
1979 and 1988 the names of theatres of war were inscribed in bronze letters on the 
courtyard walls.
Rosemary and Pencil Pines used in the courtyard are symbolically associated with 
remembrance and sacrifice (Pearson & Crocket 1995: 24-27).
Galleries and collections
A series of galleries and displays exhibit artefacts related to Australia's involvement in war 
and form a major component of the AWM. The galleries are an integral aspect of the AWM’s 
commemorative and museum functions to remember and increase an understanding of 
Australians’ involvement in war. This includes outstanding dioramas and picture models 
dating from 1920 through to 1983. Several dioramas (four large, six small and two very 
small series) constructed prior to the opening of the AWM have survived with modifications. 
The building initially made extensive use of skylights for galleries and diorama displays but 
these were modified after conservation problems arose. In 1968-71 major alterations 
included the extension of the transept wings which provided additional gallery space and the 
closing of skylights in favour of artificial lighting. Most of the galleries have been altered 
significantly since their construction. The Sinai Palestine Gallery, in situ since 1941, is largely 
intact, including the original ceiling pattern and rubber tile flooring (Pearson & Crocket 1995: 
25-27). Internal alterations in 1996-97 retained the Sinai Palestine Gallery.
The AWM houses an extensive and unique collection of artefacts and records on Australians’ 
experience of war. These comprise: films, photographs and sound recordings (including 
unedited material taken by official cameramen and private individuals, commercial 
documentaries, oral histories, radio interviews, period music); printed and ephemeral 
materials (such as official records, diaries, postcards); military heraldry; tens of thousands 
military technology objects; dioramas and other models; and artworks including those that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
originated in the official war art schemes. The AWM has the nation’s largest archive of the 
writings of ordinary Australians on their experience of war (AWM web site). The First World 
War dioramas are significant icons as: rare surviving examples of artist created three 
dimensional display models; documents that were specifically created to record historical 
events; and highly creative interpretive devices. The Battle of Romani, the last large 
diorama, and the Transport diorama series are in their original location in the Sinai Gallery.
ANZAC Hall
ANZAC Hall was built as a modern, flexible exhibition hall of 3,000 square metres to display 
the AWM's collection of large technology objects. The design of a high curved wall of 
aerodynamic plan form some 20 metres behind the main building provided space and 
retained the view of the original building ‘in the round’, as originally intended by Sodersteen 
and Crust. The hall sits unobtrusively behind the iconic main building. The fan shaped bulk 
of the building was excavated in the hillside, so that it would have the minimum impact on 
views from Anzac Parade, with a large curved metal roof fanning out from the centre point of 
a dome behind the wall. A simple steel/glass bridge link joins the existing building to the new 
hall.
The stone, concrete, metal and glass of the new hall enable the new forms to ‘meld’ 
appropriately with the heritage values of the main building and its landscape setting. In 
2005, ANZAC Hall received the RAIA’s Sir Zelman Cowen Award for public buildings for its 
design excellence (Architecture Australia 2005: 56-61).
C E W Bean Building
The building, designed by Denton Corker Marshall Architects, was completed in March 2006. 
The design, the location and external finishes are compatible with other AWM buildings. The 
building comprises a simple masonry flat roofed block embedded into the landscape behind a 
stone embankment. It is situated to the east of the AWM and is connected to it by an 
underground tunnel. Due to the topography, most of the lower storey is below ground level. 
The building's parapet height aligns with the main mid level parapet of the AWM building. It 
is set back nine metres from the existing road kerb adjacent to the stone embankment. The 
building houses paper based collections, facilities for the photographic laboratories, a 
workshop and staff. The tunnel allows for the safe movement of collections.
Landscape setting
The open landscape surrounding the main building and the natural landscape of the Mount 
Ainslie backdrop are important features of the complex. Eucalypts and wattles are planted to 
the east of the building, giving an appearance of an extension of the natural vegetation of 
Mount Ainslie as proposed in the 1952 plans. To the west of the building are mixed exotic 
plantings of deciduous and coniferous trees including the Lone Pine (Ratcliffe 1993). The 
Lone
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Pine tree was planted by the Duke of Gloucester in 1934 in memory of all sons who died in 
the Lone Pine attack in Gallipoli (1915). An Australian soldier who took part in the campaign 
in which his brother was killed, collected seed from one of the branches of an Aleppo pine 
used by the Turks as overhead cover for their trenches. His mother raised a tree from the 
seed and presented it to the AWM (Pearson & Crocket 1995: 44).
The ceremonial landscape immediately in front of the main building takes the form of an 
amphitheatre with central steps leading up to the AWM. There are paved and grassed 
terraces each side of the steps and the focus of the amphitheatre is the Stone of 
Remembrance.
Remembrance Park contains two Victoria Cross memorials and a commemorative plaque 
marking the end of the Remembrance driveway (2002) that links Canberra to Sydney. Five 
trees that commemorate various branches of the armed forces were originally planted along 
the western side of the AWM but have since been relocated to enhance the visual 
interpretation of the main building. A Sculpture Garden, located to the west of the main 
building, features Sir Bertram Mackennal’s famous 1906 War sculpture portraying Bellona, 
the Roman goddess of war, and the Merchant Seamen Roll of Honour on either side of the 
sculpture. Other commemorative works include memorial plaques and memorials to the 
British Commonwealth Occupation Force and to Australian servicewomen and important 
sculptures such as Simpson and his donkey, Australian serviceman, and Sir Edward "Weary" 
Dunlop. Further memorials are expected to be located in the area. The surrounding 
landscape also includes a large gun from HMAS Adelaide and First World War one guns. The 
courtyard between the AWM building and ANZAC Hall is planted with pencil pines.
Anzac Parade
Anzac Parade is one of the major cultural landscapes of Australia. It is a broad ceremonial 
avenue named in honour of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps. Set along the land 
axis – a key feature of Griffin’s 1912 plan – it stretches from near the north shore of Lake 
Burley Griffin to the foot of the AWM, along the line of sight from Parliament House. Along 
each side of the road is a row of 11 memorials commemorating specific military campaigns 
or services. They are mostly sculptures in a variety of styles ranging from naturalistic to 
Modernist. The memorials relate to Anzac Parade and Anzac Park: both sides of Anzac 
Parade are bounded by Anzac Park; the tree-covered, sloping grassy strips at the interface of 
the parade and the park feature 10 symmetrically placed aprons prepared for national 
memorials. Anzac Parade is a distinguishable landmark, particularly from Mount Ainslie. The 
red gravel (some say symbolising blood) and the mixed plantings of Australian blue gums 
and New Zealand Hebe species link the parliamentary zone to the northern lakeshore.
Desert Mounted Corps Memorial (also known as the ‘Light Horse Memorial’, 1968)
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The memorial commemorates Australians and New Zealanders who served in Egypt, Palestine 
and Syria from 1916-1918. Designed by sculptor Ray Ewers OAM, the memorial is a free- 
standing, cast bronze figurative sculpture on a granite base. It depicts an Australian Light 
Horseman defending a New Zealander beside his wounded horse. The memorial is a 
recreation of a memorial in Port Said in Egypt which was destroyed during the 1956 Suez 
Crisis.
Royal Australian Air Force Memorial (1981, altered in 2001)
The memorial commemorates the Royal Australian Air Force’s 50th anniversary and honours 
those who served throughout its history. Designed by sculptor Inge King, it features three 
upward-surging wing shapes in stainless steel, representing endurance, strength and courage 
of the personnel. The bronze flight image at the centre of the composition embodies the 
struggle to conquer the elements.
Rats of Tobruk Memorial (1984)
The memorial commemorates Australians who fought against the Germans and their allies in 
the siege of Tobruk in 1941. Designed by architectural firm Denton Corker Marshall Pty Ltd, 
the memorial takes the form of an obelisk. Surrounding walls portray perimeter defences and 
the area of the siege. The bronze Eternal Flame was created by Marc Clark. The memorial is 
a replica of one that was built by Australian soldiers during the siege in the Tobruk War 
Cemetery which has since been destroyed. An inscription stone, all that survives of the 
original memorial, is incorporated into the new memorial.
Kemal Ataturk Memorial (1985)
The memorial honours Kemal Ataturk and the heroism and self-sacrifice of ANZAC and 
Turkish troops during the Gallipoli campaign. Designed by architectural firm PDCM Pty Ltd, 
the memorial consists of a crescent-shaped wall surrounding a cobble paved area. The wall 
represents the crescent symbol and five pointed star of the Turkish flag. The centre of the 
memorial includes a capsule of soil from the Gallipoli battlefields. A bronze portrait of 
Ataturk, designed by Turkish sculptor Huzeyin Gezer, is mounted on the wall. Underneath is 
an inscription of Ataturk’s words that pay tribute to the ANZACs and reflect on the awful cost 
of war. Surrounding the memorial are pine trees grown from seed collected from the 
Gallipoli ‘lone pine’.
Royal Australian Navy Memorial (also known as ‘Sailors and Ships – Interaction and 
Interdependence’, 1986)
The memorial commemorates those serving with the Royal Australian Navy throughout its
history including during the First World War, the Second World War, the Malayan Emergency

and Korean and the Vietnam and Gulf wars. Designed by Ante Dabro in collaboration with 
Lester Firth and Associates and Robin Woodward, the memorial comprises bronze figures that 
represent the daily activities of naval life. Moving water complements the dynamics of the 
sculpture.
Australian Hellenic Memorial (1988)
The memorial commemorates those who died in campaigns in Greece and Crete (1941). 
Designed by architects Ancher, Mortlock and Woolley Pty Ltd, the marble memorial evokes 
an amphitheatre set in an olive grove. The short Doric column symbolises the birth of 
civilisation and is set in a mosaic pavement designed by Mary Hall. Damaged steel 
fragments echo the futility of war and its destructive effects.
Australian Army Memorial (1989)
The memorial recognises the contribution of Australian soldiers for their service and 
excellence in all theatres of war. Designed by sculptors Charles Smith and Joan Walsh Smith 
in collaboration with architects Ken Maher and Partners, the memorial comprises two bronze 
figures representing Australian soldiers facing east towards the rising sun. Seven cylindrical 
pillars set in water recall the seven major overseas conflicts and the long sea voyages 
involved in all Australian campaigns. The memorial reminds the visitor of the importance of 
the Australian ‘digger’ and his role in the formation of the national character and sentiment.
Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorial (1992)
The memorial commemorates the 50,000 Australians who fought in the Vietnam War. It was 
designed by architectural firm Tonkin Zulaikha Harford and sculptor Ken Unsworth AM. Three 
concrete stellae, rising from a shallow moat, form a dramatic centre and enclose a 
contemplative space. The wall has inscriptions that recall political and military events and an 
etched photograph shows Australian troops waiting to be airlifted to Nui Dat, after Operation 
Ulmarrah. Suspended from pillars is a halo of stones and a scroll, containing the names of 
Australians who died, is sealed into the stones. Surrounding the memorial are six empty 
seats dedicated to the six servicemen missing in action.
Australian Service Nurses Memorial (1999)
The memorial honours past and present service nurses, who have cared for the sick and 
wounded since the South African War. Designed by Robin Moorhouse, in conjunction with 
Monumental Design, the memorial is made of etched glass, with text and images cast into 
the inner walls that portray the history and contribution of Australian Service Nursing. The 
memorial includes a collage of photographs and diary extracts and letters in original 
handwriting. Interlocking glass panels symbolise the nurturing hands of nursing.

Australian National Korean Memorial (2000)
The memorial commemorates those who served in the Korean War. It was designed by the 
ANKWEM Design Group, in conjunction with the architectural firm of Daryl Jackson Pty Ltd, 
and in accordance with the requirements of the Australia National Korean Memorial 
Committee. A central walkway leads to a semi-enclosed contemplative space featuring a 
Korean boulder and a statement in Korean script representing peace and independence. The 
use of granite, gravel and white and grey tones in the memorial recalls the harsh Korean 
climate and terrain – the lasting impressions of those who fought there. A scroll represents 
the 21 countries that were involved in the war and bronze figures represent the involvement 
of 17,000 Australians. Fields of stainless steel posts symbolise those who died and an obelisk 
commemorates those who died with no known grave. The inscription, taken from the United 
Nations memorial Cemetery in Pusan, creates a link with the Australians buried there.
New Zealand Memorial (2001)
The memorial commemorates the long co-operation between Australian and New Zealand 
and the ANZAC experience. A gift from the New Zealand Government, it was designed by 
Kingsley Baird and Studio Pacific Architecture from New Zealand. The memorial is a bronze 
representation of the handles of a flax basket, an important element of New Zealand culture. 
It is 11 metres high and stretches as if to cross Anzac Parade. At the base of each handle is 
a paved gathering space, that are landscaped areas with Maori and Aboriginal artworks. At 
the centre of the paving on each side is buried soil from Gallipoli, the birth of the ANZAC 
tradition, and the names of the campaigns where New Zealanders and Australians fought 
together are inscribed on the paving. The memorial’s basket handles symbolise cooperation, 
mutual experiences and sharing the load.
History:
The concept of a national war museum to commemorate the sacrifice and loss of Australians 
in the war* originated in London with Australia’s official war correspondent, Charles Bean, 
and officers of the AIF during the First World War. The idea took hold while Bean was visiting 
Pozières in France, where Australia suffered 23,000 casualties in less than seven weeks of 
fighting in 1916. Bean's idea was to set aside a place in Australia where families and friends 
could grieve for those buried in places far away and difficult to visit – a place that would also 
contribute to an understanding of war itself. His vision evolved over the following years for a 
national memorial to function as both a shrine for those who died in the war and to house 
relics and trophies from the battlefields. Bean was later commissioned to write the official 
history of the First World War and was active in establishing a war records body in Australia.
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Australia gained control of Australia’s war records from 1916 and John Treloar was appointed 
to head a new Australian War Records Section in May 1917. In early 1917 the 
Commonwealth Government gave support for Bean's concept of a national war memorial in 
Canberra. The Australian War Museum Committee (AWMC) was established in 1919 and 
Henry Gullett was appointed as the Director.
The Federal Capital Territory (later the Australian Capital Territory) was created as the 
nation’s capital in Canberra in 1911. Walter Burley Griffin won the international competition 
for the design in 1912 and his design was revised and gazetted in 1918. He proposed a 
central area featuring a series of artificially modelled lake basins and a land axis extending 
from Mount Ainslie, through the centre of a group of government buildings on the south side 
of the proposed central lake basin. A national war memorial/museum was not part of 
Griffin’s plan. Following Griffin’s departure in 1920, the development of Canberra was taken 
over by the Federal Capital Advisory Committee, chaired by architect and planner, John 
Sulman.
A Canberra site for the national war memorial was first considered in about 1919 and the 
Commonwealth Government later announced the site at the northern end of the land axis 
below Mount Ainslie. In 1923, Bean and the AWMC indicated their preference to the Federal 
Capital Advisory Committee for the national war memorial and its collection* – it should ‘not 
be colossal in scale, but rather a gem of its kind’. The building should be ‘in the nature of a 
temple surrounded by a garden of its own’ and the collection should not be massive as might 
be expected in Britain, France or America (McKernan 1991: 94-95). The Australian War 
Memorial (AWM) was constituted under the Australian War Memorial Act 1925 and it was 
given a prominent and symbolic site on Griffin’s land axis, opposite Parliament House and 
separate from the governmental and civic groups. This was similar to Lutyen’s New Delhi, 
where the
All-India War Memorial Arch (1921-31) and the Viceroy’s Palace were to face each other at 
opposite ends of a ceremonial avenue. Griffin supported the prominent siting of the AWM. The 
project was to cost no more than £250,000.
The competition for the AWM was conducted in 1925-26. The entries were assessed by 
Professor Leslie Wilkinson, Sir Charles Rosenthal and John Smith Murdoch (Commonwealth’s 
Director-General of Works). Short listed entries were sent to London for adjudication by Sir 
Reginald Blomfield, designer of works for the Imperial War Graves Commission. None of the 
entries met all of the competition conditions and no winner was announced. Two 
competitors, Emil Sodersteen and John Crust, were asked to develop a new collaborative 
design to incorporate Sodersteen’s architectural style and Crust’s innovative and cost cutting 
approach. Sodersteen and Crust presented their design in 1927. The architectural style was 
primarily Sodersteen's and drew on the recent art deco style, while the form of the building 
was
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
strongly influenced by Crust's intention to incorporate a commemorative courtyard for the 
Roll of Honour (Pearson & Crocket 1995: 10-11; Inglis 1998: 341). The competition 
committee also had an influence on the design.
Construction began in early 1928 but was curtailed and postponed by the onset of the 
Depression. In 1934 work started again in a limited way by builders Simmie and Company. 
The design underwent many changes throughout its fourteen years of construction and 
major details were not resolved until 1938. Crust supervised the completion of the building 
following disputes between Sodersteen and the AWM Board, and Sodersteen and Crust, 
which resulted in Sodersteen’s resignation in 1938 (McKernan 1991: 10). In 1935, the 
collections and staff were moved into parts of the building. The AWM was officially opened 
on 11 November 1941 although some areas were not completed until many years later. At 
this time, the AWM comprised the main building, a ‘gun park’ enclosure at the rear of the 
building, the commemorative stone for the building (1929) and the Lone Pine tree (1934). 
The Roll of Honour was not yet completed in the cloisters, the Hall of Memory was unbuilt 
and the grounds were not yet landscaped.
The AWM’s role has expanded several times since its opening and extensions were made to 
the building to reflect this. The legislation was amended in 1941 to include Australia’s 
involvement in the Second World War and plans to extend the building were prepared from 
1947 but these were not built for some years. In 1952, the AWM’s role was expanded to 
include Australia’s involvement in all armed conflicts, and this was further broadened in 1973 
to allow the commemoration of Australians who were not in the armed forces. Key changes 
to the AWM since its opening have included: the Administration Building designed by Denton 
Corker and Marshall (1988); installation of stained glass windows in the Hall of Memory 
(1950); installation of Ewer’s statue in the Hall of Memory (1955); installation of mosaics in 
the Hall of Memory (1955-58); opening of the Hall of Memory (1959); completion of the Roll 
of Honour (1967); major extensions (1968-71); alterations including new stairs, theatre, 
western entrance and a bookshop (1983-84); and removal of Ewer’s stature; and the 
interment of an AIF soldier into the newly constructed Tomb of the Unknown Australian 
Soldier in the Hall of Memory (Armistice Day 1993). ANZAC Hall, a new exhibition space to 
house the AWM’s large technology objects, was designed by Denton Corker and Marshall in 
1999 and completed in 2001.
The design and installation of the AWM’s landscaping has undergone substantial changes. 
The open landscape surrounding the main building initially reflected Crust and Parramore’s 
1940 design but this was modified by later works. From 1942-45, the commemorative 
courtyard was the venue for ANZAC Day and commemorative services. A new setting was 
needed when
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
it could no longer accommodate everyone who wished to attend. In 1959 Meldrum and Noad 
designed an amphitheatre and parade ground for commemorative services. Roads and car 
parks for the AWM were planned in 1965-69 and the paved display area to the west of the 
building dates from the late 1960s (Pearson & Crocket 1995: 42-44; Freeman 2004: 4). In 
1999 a new Sculpture Garden, based on a design by JFW Architects, was opened to the west 
of the main building.
Anzac Park and Anzac Parade were created in the 1960s and have become important 
settings for war memorials commemorating Australian’s involvement in war. The National 
Capital Development Commission (NCDC) architects and landscape architects Gareth Roberts 
and Richard Clough collaborated on the design of Anzac Parade and its architectural 
elements, as part of the 1961 wider proposals for Commonwealth Park and Lake Burley 
Griffin foreshores. Two portal buildings, Anzac Park East and Anzac Park West, were 
completed in 1965 and 1966 respectively. Queen Elizabeth II opened Anzac Parade on 
ANZAC Day 1965 – the fiftieth anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli. Since the 1960s, a 
series of memorials have evolved along each side of Anzac Parade under the auspices of the 
NCDC and the National Capital Authority. Anzac Parade is the major national venue for the 
Anzac Day march and other ceremonies to commemorate those who served Australia in 
times of war. The AWM is one of the termini of the Remembrance Driveway from Sydney to 
Canberra initiated by Queen Elizabeth in 1954.
Condition and Integrity:
Integrity
AWM: The design of the building, galleries and displays has evolved over a long period of 
time, while the overall form of the building has generally not changed. The 1968-71 
extension of the transepts is in sympathy with this form. The interior spaces including the 
galleries have been much altered over the years and the original skylights were modified and 
then closed.
The essential and integrated relationship of the relics, records and memorial spaces, which 
was part of the early conception for the AWM, remains strongly expressed. Refer to the 
description and history for further details of the changes.
Anzac Hall: As erected.
Condition
AWM: The building is currently in fair to good condition. The conservation management plan 
(Pearson and Crocket 1995) for Bligh Voller Nield identified several problem areas. Cracks in 
the masonry and concrete construction appeared before the building's completion and these 
have continued. Over time, cracking has affected the backgrounds for dioramas

(subsequently repaired or replaced) and the Hall of Memory where it is a continuing 
conservation concern. The building has also suffered stonework deterioration and water 
leaks. Much of the damage has been restored since 1995. The conservation management 
plan now requires updating.
ANZAC Hall: The building is in good condition.

Summary Statement of Significance:
The Australian War Memorial is Australia's National Shrine to those Australians who lost their 
lives and suffered as a result of war. As such it is important to the Australian community as a 
whole and has special associations with veterans and their families and descendants of those 
who fought in wars (Criteria A.4, H.1 and G.1). The Memorial building is a purpose built 
repository where the nature of commemoration is based in equal parts in the relationship 
between the building, the collections of objects and records and the commemorative spaces. 
This is unique in Australia and believed rare in the world (Criterion B.2). The building is one of 
Canberra's earliest major examples of Australian Art Deco architecture, with fine examples of 
applied art in the same style. The building's design also successfully fulfils its special functions 
and reinforces the role of the place as a Shrine (Criterion D.2). The War Memorial is an 
important landmark in Canberra, Australia's National Capital. As the terminating building at 
the northern end of the land axis of Griffin's city design and one of only three buildings sited 
on the axis, the Memorial makes a major contribution to the principal views from both 
Parliament Houses (Criterion E.1). The success of the Memorial as a landmark is due in part to 
its distinctive massing and symmetry; its relative visual isolation given its privileged siting on 
the land axis; landscaped grounds and the backdrop of the forested slopes of Mount Ainslie.
The role of the Memorial as a National icon is reinforced by its central location in the nation's
capital (Criterion F.1). The Memorial's success as a shrine, an architectural form and as part of 
Canberra's urban plan results in part from special associations with the lives and works of a

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
number of individuals whose activities have been significant in Australia's history. These 
include the Memorial's founders Charles Bean, John Treloar and Henry Gullett; architects Emil 
Sodersteen and John Crust; and M Napier Waller who created artworks for the building 
(Criterion H.1).

Description:
HISTORY
The concept of the Australian War Memorial originated with Australia's official war 
correspondent, Charles Bean, during World War One. An important related development at the 
time was Australia's successful attempt in 1916 to acquire control of records relating to its 
involvement in the War. As a consequence John Treloar was appointed head of the Australian 
War Records Section in May 1917. At the same time that Bean was active in the establishment 
of the War Records Section, he was also developing ideas for a national war museum to house 
battle field relics and trophies. In early 1917 the Commonwealth indicated support for Bean's 
concept of a national war museum in Canberra to house the National Collection of war relics 
and trophies. By 1918 Bean had strengthened his vision by linking the relics and records with 
the creation of a memorial to those who died in the war. In this vision both the relics and 
records became sacred because of their association with the sacrifice of lives in the war. An 
Australian War Museum committee was established in 1919 and Henry Gullett was appointed 
first Director of the Museum. Bean and Treloar conceived that the memorial and museum 
functions were philosophically and operationally inseparable and, with Gullett, they were to 
guide its creation and its operations over a forty year period.
The Federal Capital Territory, now the Australian Capital Territory, was created in 1911 as the 
site of Canberra, the Nation's Capital. Walter Burley Griffin won the international competition 
for the design of Canberra in 1912 and his revised plan in 1918 was Gazetted as the Official 
Plan. Griffin proposed a central area featuring a series of artificially modelled lake basins and a 
land axis extending from Mount Ainslie, through the centre of a group of government buildings 
and the Capital. A Canberra site for the Australian War Memorial was initially considered in 
about 1919. In 1923 the Commonwealth announced its intention to proceed with a national 
war memorial in Canberra and the chosen site was the current location, at the northern end of 
the land axis below Mount Ainslie. The Commonwealth also agreed to the name Australian War 
Memorial for the institution and in 1925 the Memorial was constituted under Commonwealth 
legislation.
In 1928 Griffin expressed the view that the proposed site was suitable for the memorial. The 
competition for the design of the memorial was conducted in 1925-26, however none of the 
entries received met all of the competition conditions and no winner was announced. Two of 
the competitors, Emil Sodersteen and John Crust were subsequently asked to develop a new 
collaborative design incorporating the architectural style of Sodersteen and the innovative and
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cost cutting approach of Crust. The new joint Sodersteen and Crust design was presented in 
1927. The architectural style of the design was primarily Sodersteen's work and drew upon the 
recent development of the Art Deco style. The form of the building was strongly influenced by 
Crust's intention to incorporate a commemorative courtyard for the Roll of Honour.
Construction, which began in 1928-29 was curtailed and then postponed by the onset of the 
Depression. In 1934 work started again in a limited way. The builders at this time were 
Simmie and Company of Melbourne. The building's design was subject to many changes 
throughout its fourteen years of construction and major details were not resolved until 1938.
Parts of the building were occupied by memorial staff and collections as early as 1935, 
although the main building structure was not completed until 1941. The official opening on 11 
November 1941 acknowledged that the building was substantially complete, however some 
areas of the memorial were not finished until many years later. One of the outcomes of the 
long construction period was the development of the display technology for the collection.
The intended role of the memorial to commemorate those who died in World War One, then 
known as the Great War, was reviewed in 1939 as another war loomed. After much 
consideration, the Board of the Memorial recommended in 1941 that the scope of the 
Memorial's Act be extended to include World War two. As a result, plans for the extension of 
the Memorial were prepared in about 1947 although not constructed for many years.
The Memorial's Act was again amended in 1952 to extend its scope to include Australian 
involvement in all wars. In 1973, the scope was broadened to allow commemoration of 
Australian's who died as a result of war but were not in the armed forces. Significant work at 
the Memorial includes: 1950, stained glass windows installed in Hall of Memory; 1955, statue 
installed in the Hall of Memory; 1955-58, mosaics installed in Hall of Memory; 1959, Hall of 
Memory opened; 1967, Roll of Honour for World Wars One and Two completed; 1968-71, 
major extensions undertaken; 1983-84, alterations add new stairs, theatre, western entrance 
and foyer bookshop; and 1993, Ewers' statue removed and the Tomb of the Unknown 
Australian Soldier constructed in the Hall of Memory. Ewer's statue is now located in the 
grounds to the western side of the main building. During 1999 -2001 a major new building, 
ANZAC Hall was constructed.
The Australian War Memorial was conceived to commemorate those Australians who died in 
war, initially the Great War but later all wars. In part, it was a response to the perceived need 
for a place in Australia for relatives and friends to mourn those who died and were buried 
overseas, in places out of reach of most Australians. There is a substantial sector of the
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
community, in particular the veterans organisations, for whom the Memorial has been and still 
is a strong and direct symbol of Australia's involvement in war. It is a sacred place dedicated 
to the memory of those who died as a result of war. This is reflected in visitor numbers, in 
attendance at Anzac Day ceremonies and public interest in the 1993 interment of the 
Unknown Australian Soldier. The Memorial contains a number of key spaces, many of which 
have evolved over time.
The Hall of Memory
The Hall of Memory was originally conceived as containing the names of Australia's war dead 
or the Roll of Honour. Because of the cost of this proposal, the names were relocated in the 
joint Sodersteen and Crust design to a new space, the commemorative courtyard and the Hall 
was left without a clear purpose. In 1937 the Board of the Memorial agreed to complete the 
Hall by installing sculpture, stained glass windows and mosaics. Napier Waller was 
commissioned to undertake the windows and mosaics and Leslie Bowles the sculpture. The 
windows reflect World War One and the mosaics on the pendentives represent the four arms 
of the services, including the women's services. Bowles produced several designs for the 
sculptures which were all rejected. After his death Ray Ewers was commissioned to produce 
the statue of a young serviceman which was installed in 1955. This statue was removed in 
1993 to accommodate the construction of the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier. The 
purpose of the Hall is now as a mausoleum.
Courtyard and Roll of Honour
The courtyard with its cloisters and Roll of Honour evolved from Crust's design collaboration 
with Sodersteen. It includes a Pool of Reflection which gained a stepped granite cascade by 
Robert Woodward at its northern end in 1980. This was replaced in 1988 by an eternal flame. 
At the southern end of the pool is the Inauguration Stone for the Memorial and the courtyard 
is flanked with twenty-six carved sandstone gargoyles designed by Bowles. The Roll of Honour 
proved to be a difficult component to complete for a variety of reasons. Despite detailed 
consideration in the 1930s, it was not installed until 1967. Given the changing scope of the 
commemorative function, the Memorial established a Commemorative Book in 1975 to list 
Australians who died as a result of war but were previously excluded from the Roll. One of 
Charles Bean's wishes is reflected in the design of the Roll, no rank or decorations are 
recorded on the basis that all died equally. The Roll of Honour contains the names of over 
120,000 Australians killed in war from the Sudan in 1855 to the Vietnam War in the 1970s.
Between 1979 and 1988 the names of theatres of war were inscribed in bronze letters on the
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
courtyard walls. The plantings in the courtyard have been changed on a number of occasions 
over the years. Rosemary and Pencil Pines used in the courtyard have symbolism associated 
with remembrance and sacrifice.
ANZAC Hall
In 1999 the Australian War Memorial proposed to build a modern, flexible exhibition hall of 
3,000 square metres to showcase its world-class collection of large technology objects. The 
design for the new hall, called ANZAC Hall, consisted of a large wall 20 metres behind the 
main building to act as a backdrop to the iconic main building. The bulk of the building was 
dug into the ground so that it could not be seen from Anzac Parade, with a large curved metal 
roof fanning out from the centre point of a dome behind the wall. A simple glass link joins the 
existing building with the new hall. The building was designed by Denton Corker and Marshall. 
A Federation fund of $ 11.9 million funded the project with an additional contribution of almost
$1 million from the Australian War Memorial for infrastructure, landscaping and the new 
workshop.
Galleries and Displays
One of the major components of the Memorial is the series of galleries and displays, including 
the Aeroplane Hall. This is where the artefacts related to Australia's involvement in war are 
displayed. As well, large and small dioramas or picture models, dating from 1920 through to 
1983 are on display. The surviving dioramas constructed prior to the opening of the Memorial 
in 1941 include four large, six small and two very small series, all of which have been modified 
and most relocated. The Memorial building initially made extensive use of skylights for 
galleries and displays, however this was found to create serious conservation problems and 
modifications were made to reduce the amount of light. In 1968-71 major alterations to the 
Memorial included the extension of the transept wings which provided additional gallery space 
and the closing of skylights in favour of artificial lighting. Other accommodation in the building 
provided initially or later includes the library, war records storage, office space and workshop 
facilities.
Landscape
The landscaping work around the Memorial initially reflected the 1940 design of John Crust 
and T Parramore, however, later works obliterated the evidence of this design. In 1959 a 
masterplan for the site was prepared by Meldrum and Noad which included the amphitheatre 
in front of the Memorial. Plans for the kiosk also date from this time, although there have been
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
variations from the 1959 plan. The current roads and carparks were planned in 1965-69 and 
the paved display area to the west of the Memorial dates from the late 1960s.
To the east of the building the planting has been developed using eucalypts and wattles, 
appearing to be an extension of the natural vegetation of Mount Ainslie as proposed in the 
planting plans of 1952. Within this area Maidens Gum, Tasmanian Blue Gum and Camden 
Woollybutt have established. To the west of the building are mixed exotic plantings of 
deciduous and coniferous trees.
The Lone Pine planted in the grounds is an Aleppo pine raised from seed collected by a soldier 
on Lone Pine Ridge at Gallipoli in 1915. It was given to the Memorial by his mother in memory 
of her second son who was killed at Gallipoli. The tree was planted by the Duke of Gloucester 
in 1934.
PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION
The Australian War Memorial is located at the northern end of the land axis, the major 
planning axis which runs from Parliament House on Capital Hill, through Federation Mall and 
Parkes Place, along Anzac Parade to Mount Ainslie. The Memorial has an elevated position at 
the end of Anzac Parade and is framed by Mount Ainslie in the background.
The immediate site of the Memorial is the area bounded by Limestone Avenue, Fairbairn 
Avenue and Treloar Crescent. The Memorial is part of a larger landscape which is structured by 
the land axis and includes Anzac Park and Anzac Parade as well as the Remembrance Nature 
Park on the slopes of Mount Ainslie behind the Memorial. The Australian War Memorial is also 
associated with the many memorials which line Anzac Parade and commemorate specific 
aspects of Australia's involvement in war.
Architectural Design Importance
The main Memorial building is a stone faced War Memorial Museum in the Art Deco style which 
displays Byzantine modelling in its interpenetrating masses and a front entrance showing 
Egyptian influences in its pylons and massing. The features of the style displayed by the 
building include: a stepped skyline, concentration of ornament on the upper part of the 
building, tower feature and a monumental entrance. The building has a cruciform plan with 
two floors of galleries, a library, war records storage, office space and workshop facilities. The 
major commemorative features are the central courtyard and pool, the flanking cloisters with 
the Roll of Honour, and the copper domed Hall of Memory.
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The Hall with its stepped cubic forms and copper dome is the key architectural and landmark 
element of the place. As the major vertical element in the architectural composition, it closes 
the view from within the courtyard and is a prominent terminating feature of the land axis. 
The mosaics and stained glass windows within the Hall are outstanding pieces of monumental 
applied art in the Art Deco style and identify the principal contemplative space.
Features of Importance
Major features of the site include the main Memorial building; the ceremonial landscape 
immediately in front of the main building; the Lone Pine, external displays and sculptures; 
Administration Building; kiosk; ANZAC Hall; roads and carparks. The Memorial Hall also now 
incorporates the Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier and as such demonstrates changing 
and evolving concepts of commemoration.
The Roll of Honour is a document and visual statement of the extent and identity of Australia's 
war dead. It is a key element of the founding concept of the Memorial, although only installed 
in the 1960s.
The galleries display the Memorial's collection in a way which leads to an understanding of its 
commemorative function. While most of the galleries have been altered dramatically since 
construction, the Sinai Palestine Gallery is relatively original and intact.
The World War One dioramas are important icons of the Memorial, especially those in situ 
since 1941 in the Sinai Palestine Gallery. They are rare surviving examples of artist created 
three dimensional display models, important as documents that were specifically created to 
record historical events and as highly creative interpretive devices. This gallery has the last 
large diorama, the battle of Romani and the last diorama series, the Transport series, in their 
original locations. The gallery also has its original rubber tile flooring and its original ceiling 
pattern largely intact .
The open space of the landscape surrounds of the building and the natural landscape of the 
Mount Ainslie backdrop are important features of the complex. The Queen's Tree marks the 
site of a tree planted by Queen Elizabeth II that was later vandalised and replaced with a 
EUCALYPTUS NICHOLII. This tree has not survived and a group of three trees were planted by 
the Governor General on 1 November 2002 in Remembrance Park to mark the Canberra end 
of the Remembrance driveway linking the national capital to Sydney. There are five 
commemorative trees commemorating various branches of the armed forces planted along the
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
western side of the Memorial building. These have subsequently been relocated to enhance 
the visual interpretation of the main building. Trees of horticultural importance are 
EUCALYPTUS GLOBULUS ssp GLOBULUS, E. GLOBULUS ssp MAIDENII, E. MACARTHURII, E. 
RUBIDA-CINERIA hybird, E. MICHAELIANA .
Social Value Importance
The War Memorial is the National shrine for all Australians. The Memorial building is a purpose 
built repository where the nature of commemoration is based in equal parts in the relationship 
between the building, the collections of objects and records and the commemorative spaces. 
The ceremonial landscape immediately in front of the main building takes the form of an 
amphitheatre with central steps leading up to the Memorial building. There are paved and 
grassed terraces each side of the steps and the focus of the amphitheatre is the Stone of 
Remembrance. The remaining landscape areas are generally grassed with scattered tree 
plantings. The Lone Pine, growing to the west of the Memorial building and surrounded by an 
ornate wrought metal fence, has direct association with the Gallipoli campaign in World War 
One. Remembrance Park contains two Victoria Cross memorials, trees and a commemorative 
plaque marking one of the ends of the Remembrance driveway connecting the national capital 
with Sydney.
History: Not Available
Condition and Integrity:
Cracks in the masonry and concrete construction appeared before the building's completion 
and continue. Over time, cracking has affected the backgrounds for dioramas (subsequently 
repaired or replaced) and the Hall of Memory where it is a continuing conservation concern. 
The building has also suffered stonework deterioration and water leaks. The building is 
currently in generally fair to good condition. The design of the building, galleries and displays 
has evolved over a long period of time, while the overall form of the Memorial building has 
generally not changed. The 1968-71 extension of the transepts is in sympathy with this form. 
The interior spaces including the galleries have been much altered over the years and the 
original skylights were modified and then closed. The essential and integrated relationship of 
the relics, records and memorial spaces, which was part of the early conception for the 
Memorial, remains strongly expressed. (June 1995)

Summary Statement of Significance:
Design Importance
The Parliament House Vista is the central designed landscape of Canberra, that expresses the 
core of the Walter Burley Griffin design vision for Canberra. It is highly significant for its 
symbolic representation of the democratic interchange between the people and their elected 
representatives and its use of the natural landforms to generate a strong planning geometry. 
It expresses a masterly synthesis and ordering of topographical features and administrative 
functions to meet the needs of a national capital. The vista landscape embraces the central 
land axis and part of the water axis and most of the Parliamentary Triangle including the area 
known as the Parliamentary Zone. The significance incorporates Walter Burley Griffin's vision 
for the area, as the focus of Commonwealth parliamentary and governmental activity as well 
as national cultural life. This vision has been partly realised and the place is the setting for 
major, government, judicial and cultural institutions. The northern extent of the vista of Anzac 
Parade and the Australian War Memorial, despite differing from the original plan, are 
significant for memorial purposes developed in response to the needs of the people. Despite
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
being modified to a lesser degree to accommodate the impact of wars on Australians, the Vista 
now presents as a philosophical concept expressed in urban planning, landscape and 
architecture, to achieve a grand vision of a symbolic, unified and visually dramatic place 
(Criterion F.1)
( Australian Historic Themes 7.4 Federating Australia, 8.10 , Pursuing excellence in the arts 
and sciences)
The Parliament House Vista incorporating the central national area, is the core of the most 
ambitious and most successful example of twentieth century urban planning in Australia. It is 
important for its design pattern with large landscape and waterscape spaces with their 
enframement by treed avenues and at the lake by bridges, the terminal vista features of the 
Australian War Memorial and Mount Ainslie at the northern end and Parliament House at the 
southern end, with the Carillon and Captain Cook Jet creating balanced vertical features in the 
water plane (Criterion F.1).
The spatial setting of the buildings as features in the landscape reflects Beaux Arts planning 
concepts and the building masses and their careful location complement the significance of the 
overall landscape pattern. Across the Parliamentary Triangle, the buildings of Old Parliament 
House, and East and West Blocks provide a distinctive Stripped Classical architectural 
patterned horizontal band, that contributes to the symmetrical overall patterning of the 
landscape. At a higher elevation, Parliament House is a significant feature terminating the 
southern end of the land axis, culminating the classical landmark image of the triangle apex. 
The John Gorton Building (the former Administrative Building) and the Treasury Building 
balance the composition on King George Terrace while at the Lake edge the post-war 
architecture of the National Library of Australia and the High Court - National Gallery Precinct 
are prominent modern architectural forms and have a significant historical layering effect. The 
Portal Buildings provide balanced building massing at the southern end of Anzac Parade 
(Criterion F.1).
Avenues of trees along the terraces, roads and pathways of deciduous, pine, and eucalypt 
species provide colour, character, and contrast, emphasisng the significance of the formal 
symmetrical design. Lombardy Poplars in groups of four, form sentinels at key locations. 
Water fountains, and statues also reinforce the significance of the total design pattern of the 
place. On the northern expanse of the vista the landscape pattern is the wide sweeping 
avenue space emphasised by red scoria gravel in the central strip and edged by large Blue 
Gums (Criterion F.1).
The vista landscape is significant for its richness of features. Many places in the Vista area
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
have individual heritage significance for their architectural design and historic importance. 
These include Old Parliament House and Curtilage, East Block Government Offices, West Block 
and the Dugout, John Gorton Building, the National Library of Australia, the High Court of 
Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, Blundells Farmhouse, Slab Outbuildings and 
Surrounds, the Australian War Memorial, the Portal Buildings, The High Court - National 
Gallery Precinct, the Carillon, and King George V Memorial (Criteria F.1 and A3).
Within the area are important parklands and gardens enhancing the significance of the 
landscape setting. These include the Gardens of Old Parliament House (the former Senate and 
House of Representative Gardens), important for expressing their history in plantings, sports 
facilities, modest features and layout pattern. Also important is the Sculpture Garden of the 
National Gallery, a significant native style garden, and the National Rose Gardens.
Commonwealth Park, the Peace Park, the Lakeshore Promenade and Kings Park are important 
landscapes for their design and popular use (Criteria F.1 and A3.)
Adding to the richness of the place is the manner in which Griffin's vision of democracy has 
also been emphasised, as places within the area have become identified with political protest 
actions by people, as exemplified in the significant Aboriginal Embassy site (Criteria F.1 and 
A3).
Historic Importance
The central national area of Canberra is strongly associated with the history of politics and 
government in Australia and the development of Canberra as the Australian National Capital. 
It is significant as the home of the Commonwealth Parliament, the focus of the Federal 
Government since 1927, initially in the Old Parliament House and from 1988 in the new 
Parliament House. The various government buildings in the area reinforce the association with 
Australian government and political history, including East and West Blocks, the Administrative 
Building, the Treasury Building and the High Court. The latter, being set apart from Parliament 
House but facing it is symbolic of the judicial role of the High Court as a physical 
representation of the separation of powers (Criterion A.4, Australian Historic Themes: 7.2 
Developing institutions of self-government and democracy).
The central national area has strong links with the planning and development of Canberra as 
the Australian Capital. The relocation of Parliament to Canberra and the central national area 
in 1927 was the focus of an intense period of development of the new city and gave purpose 
to Canberra as the Nation's Capital. Over time this association has been reinforced by the 
construction of major government buildings in the area, such as the Treasury Building, the
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Administration Building (now John Gorton Building), the Portal Buildings and latterly the new 
Parliament House, as well as the construction of major cultural institutions. The area as 
intended has become the focus of Commonwealth parliamentary and governmental activity as 
well as, to some extent, national cultural life. (Criterion A.4) (Australian Historic Themes: 4.1 
Planning urban settlement, 7.2 Developing institutions of self-government and democracy, 7.3 
Federating Australia).
The area has been associated since 1941 with the development of Australian cultural life and 
national identity through the presence of such institutions as the Australian War Memorial, the 
National Gallery of Australia, the National Science and Technology Centre and the National 
Library of Australia. The national cultural institutions reinforce the national character of the 
area and are an important symbolic group in Australia's national cultural life. The Australian 
War Memorial and Anzac Parade memorials and, to a lesser extent, the other memorials have 
and continue to play a very important role in fostering aspects of national identity, in 
particular the Australian War Memorial through its role as a National Shrine for all Australians 
(Criterion A.4, Australian Historic Themes 8.8 Remembering the Fallen).
Social Importance
The area has strong and special associations with the broad Australian community because of 
its social values as a symbol of Australia and Federal Government. The values have developed 
over many years since Canberra's creation and the relocation of the Parliament in 1927 gave 
them a special focus. The special association is reflected in the use of the area as the location 
for national memorials, the number of tourists who have and continue to visit the area, the 
media portrayal of Canberra and federal politics and the continuing use of the area as the 
venue for occasional ceremonies and political protests by sections of the community. Memorial 
features include sculptures, plaques, commemorative trees, water features and gardens. The 
collection of sculptures, associated art and design which comprise the Anzac Parade 
Memorials, give expression to key aspects of the history of Australia's armed forces and 
Australia's war involvement, and possess high social value (Criterion G.1, Australian Historic 
Themes 8.8 Remembering the fallen, 8.9 Commemorating significant events and people).
The special association for the community is also the use of the area by people demonstrating 
against government decisions. The central national area, particularly Parkes Place in front of 
Old Parliament House, has been used for countless demonstrations (Criterion G.1).
The landscape spaces are important for social activities of visitors and Canberra residents and 
these include Canberra festivals, water events, national events and parades such as Anzac
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Day Parade and the Dawn Service, and other commemorative services (Criterion G.1).
Aesthetic Value
The place has high aesthetic significance due to the visual impact of the extensive open 
sweeping vista along the land axis that can be experienced in two directions, the designed 
axes set within natural features of forested hills, patterns and textures of architectural 
massing accentuated by planned open spaces, water planes and tree plantings that are 
arranged across the area. The vista is significant for its visual drama with its ability to engage 
viewers in the visual perspective of the sweeping vista to the terminal features. The aesthetic 
significance is also a result of the large scale qualities of the axes, including the open green 
spaces, combined with patterns and symmetrical characteristics of the road networks and 
numerous designed smaller attributes. These include the rose gardens, the Old Parliament 
House Gardens, Commonwealth Park, the street tree plantings, the lake-land interface and the 
Sculpture Garden of the National Gallery, and many intimate spaces rich in texture, colour, 
fragrance and in some cases, art works and water features (Criterion E1).
Associational Value
The central national area has a special association with its designer, Walter Burley Griffin. 
Griffin is an important figure in Australia's cultural history for his overall design of Canberra as 
the Nation's Capital. The special association between the central national area and Griffin 
results from the area being the centrepiece of the planning geometry for Canberra and 
perhaps the only part of his Canberra plan to survive relatively intact. The area has a strong 
association with Marion Mahoney Griffin who prepared the perspective drawings of the Vista. 
The Vista area has a strong association with numerous architects and planners, in particular 
John Smith Murdoch, Chief architect of the Commonwealth Government, and Thomas Charles 
Weston, Superintendent of Parks, Gardens and Afforestation in Canberra, and notable 
planners of the National Capital Development Commission such as Sir John Overall, Peter 
Harrison and Paul Reid (Criterion H.1).

Blocks, the Administrative Building, the Treasury Building and the High Court. The latter, 
being set apart from Parliament House but facing it is symbolic of the judicial role of the 
High Court as a physical representation of the separation of powers.
The central national area has strong links with the planning and development of Canberra 
as the Australian Capital. The relocation of Parliament to Canberra and the central national 
area in 1927 was the focus of an intense period of development of the new city and gave 
purpose to Canberra as the Nation's Capital. Over time this association has been reinforced 
by the construction of major government buildings in the area, such as the Treasury 
Building, the Administration Building (now John Gorton Building), the Portal Buildings and 
latterly the new Parliament House, as well as the construction of major cultural institutions. 
The area as intended has become the focus of Commonwealth parliamentary and 
governmental activity as well as, to some extent, national cultural life.
The area has been associated since 1941 with the development of Australian cultural life 
and national identity through the presence of such institutions as the Australian War 
Memorial, the National Gallery of Australia, the National Science and Technology Centre 
and the National Library of Australia. The national cultural institutions reinforce the national 
character of the area and are an important symbolic group in Australia's national cultural 
life. The Australian War Memorial and Anzac Parade memorials and, to a lesser extent, the 
other memorials have and continue to play a very important role in fostering aspects of 
national identity, in particular the Australian War Memorial through its role as a National 
Shrine for all Australians.
The vista landscape is significant for its richness of features. Many places in the Vista area 
have individual heritage significance for their architectural design and historic importance. 
These include Old Parliament House and Curtilage, East Block Government Offices, West 
Block and the Dugout, John Gorton Building, the National Library of Australia, the High 
Court of Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, Blundells Farmhouse, Slab Outbuildings 
and Surrounds, the Australian War Memorial, the Portal Buildings, The High Court - 
National Gallery Precinct, the Carillon, and King George V Memorial.
Within the area are important parklands and gardens enhancing the significance of the 
landscape setting. These include the Gardens of Old Parliament House (the former Senate 
and House of Representative Gardens) with their surviving layout, the Sculpture Garden of 
the National Gallery, the National Rose Gardens, Commonwealth Park, the Peace Park, the 
Lakeshore Promenade and Kings Park .

Adding to the richness of the place is the manner in which Griffin's vision of democracy has 
also been emphasised, as places within the area have become identified with political 
protest actions by people, as exemplified in the significant Aboriginal Embassy site.
Attributes
The concentration of buildings, parklands and gardens that support Commonwealth 
parliamentary and governmental activity as well as, to some extent, national cultural life. 
These include Old Parliament House and Curtilage, East Block Government Offices, West 
Block and the Dugout, John Gorton Building, the National Library of Australia, the High 
Court of Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, Blundells Farmhouse, Slab Outbuildings 
and Surrounds, the Australian War Memorial, the Portal Buildings, The High Court - 
National Gallery Precinct, the Carillon, King George V Memorial, Sculpture Garden of the 
National Gallery, the National Rose Gardens, Commonwealth Park, the Peace Park, the 
Lakeshore Promenade and Kings Park and the Aboriginal Embassy site.
Criterion: E Aesthetic characteristics
The place has high aesthetic significance due to the visual impact of the extensive open 
sweeping vista along the land axis that can be experienced in two directions, the designed 
axes set within natural features of forested hills, patterns and textures of architectural 
massing accentuated by planned open spaces, water planes and tree plantings that are 
arranged across the area. The vista is significant for its visual drama with its ability to 
engage viewers in the visual perspective of the sweeping vista to the terminal features. The 
aesthetic significance is also a result of the large scale qualities of the axes, including the 
open green spaces, combined with patterns and symmetrical characteristics of the road 
networks and numerous designed smaller attributes. These include the rose gardens, the 
Old Parliament House Gardens, Commonwealth Park, the street tree plantings, the lake- 
land interface and the Sculpture Garden of the National Gallery, and many intimate spaces 
rich in texture, colour, fragrance and in some cases, art works and water features.
Attributes
The extensive vista along the land axis, the forested hills, patterns and textures of 
architectural massing accentuated by planned open spaces, water features and tree 
plantings, art works, the terminal features plus the interplay of scale and texture in the 
designed landscape.
Criterion: F Technical achievement
The Parliament House Vista is the central designed landscape of Canberra, that expresses 
the core of the Walter Burley Griffin design vision for Canberra. It is highly significant for its 
symbolic representation of the democratic interchange between the people and their
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
elected representatives and its use of the natural landforms to generate a strong planning 
geometry. It expresses a masterly synthesis and ordering of topographical features and 
administrative functions to meet the needs of a national capital. The vista landscape 
embraces the central land axis and part of the water axis and most of the Parliamentary 
Triangle including the area known as the Parliamentary Zone. The significance incorporates 
Walter Burley Griffin's vision for the area, as the focus of Commonwealth parliamentary and 
governmental activity as well as national cultural life. This vision has been partly realised 
and the place is the setting for major, government, judicial and cultural institutions. The 
northern extent of the vista of Anzac Parade and the Australian War Memorial, despite 
differing from the original plan, are significant for memorial purposes developed in 
response to the needs of the people. Despite being modified to a lesser degree to 
accommodate the impact of wars on Australians, the Vista now presents as a philosophical 
concept expressed in urban planning, landscape and architecture, to achieve a grand vision 
of a symbolic, unified and visually dramatic place.
The Parliament House Vista incorporating the central national area, is the core of the most 
ambitious and most successful example of twentieth century urban planning in Australia. It 
is important for its design pattern with large landscape and waterscape spaces with their 
enframement by treed avenues and at the lake by bridges, the terminal vista features of 
the Australian War Memorial and Mount Ainslie at the northern end and Parliament House 
at the southern end, with the Carillon and Captain Cook Jet creating balanced vertical 
features in the water plane.
The spatial setting of the buildings as features in the landscape reflects Beaux Arts planning 
concepts and the building masses and their careful location complement the significance of 
the overall landscape pattern. Across the Parliamentary Triangle, the buildings of Old 
Parliament House, and East and West Blocks provide a distinctive Stripped Classical 
architectural patterned horizontal band, that contributes to the symmetrical overall 
patterning of the landscape. At a higher elevation, Parliament House is a significant feature 
terminating the southern end of the land axis, culminating the classical landmark image of 
the triangle apex. The John Gorton Building (the former Administrative Building) and the 
Treasury Building balance the composition on King George Terrace while at the Lake edge 
the post-war architecture of the National Library of Australia and the High Court - National 
Gallery Precinct are prominent modern architectural forms and have a significant historical 
layering effect. The Portal Buildings provide balanced building massing at the southern end 
of Anzac Parade.
Avenues of trees along the terraces, roads and pathways of deciduous, pine, and eucalypt

species provide colour, character, and contrast, emphasisng the significance of the formal 
symmetrical design. Lombardy Poplars in groups of four, form sentinels at key locations. 
Water fountains, and statues also reinforce the significance of the total design pattern of 
the place. On the northern expanse of the vista the landscape pattern is the wide sweeping 
avenue space emphasised by red scoria gravel in the central strip and edged by large Blue 
Gums.
Many places in the Vista area have individual heritage significance for their architectural 
design and historic importance. These include Old Parliament House and Curtilage, East 
Block Government Offices, West Block and the Dugout, John Gorton Building, the National 
Library of Australia, the High Court of Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, Blundells 
Farmhouse, Slab Outbuildings and Surrounds, the Australian War Memorial, the Portal 
Buildings, The High Court - National Gallery Precinct, the Carillon, and King George V 
Memorial.
Within the area are important parklands and gardens enhancing the significance of the 
landscape setting that include the Sculpture Garden of the National Gallery, a significant 
native style garden, and the National Rose Gardens. Commonwealth Park, the Peace Park, 
the Lakeshore Promenade and Kings Park are important landscapes for their design and 
popular use.
Adding to the richness of the place is the manner in which Griffin's vision of democracy has 
also been emphasised, as places within the area have become identified with political 
protest actions by people, as exemplified in the significant Aboriginal Embassy site.
Attributes
The whole of the vista, including all elements and features contained within it, as well as 
the natural wooded hills beyond.
Criterion: G Social value
The area has strong and special associations with the broad Australian community because 
of its social values as a symbol of Australia and Federal Government. The values have 
developed over many years since Canberra's creation and the relocation of the Parliament 
in 1927 gave them a special focus. The special association is reflected in the use of the 
area as the location for national memorials, the number of tourists who have and continue 
to visit the area, the media portrayal of Canberra and federal politics and the continuing 
use of the area as the venue for occasional ceremonies and political protests by sections of 
the community. Memorial features include sculptures, plaques, commemorative trees,
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
water features and gardens. The collection of sculptures, associated art and design which 
comprise the Anzac Parade Memorials, give expression to key aspects of the history of 
Australia's armed forces and Australia's war involvement, and possess high social value.
The special association for the community is also the use of the area by people 
demonstrating against government decisions. The central national area, particularly Parkes 
Place in front of Old Parliament House, has been used for countless demonstrations.
The landscape spaces are important for social activities of visitors and Canberra residents 
and these include Canberra festivals, water events, national events and parades such as 
Anzac Day Parade and the Dawn Service, and other commemorative services.
Attributes
Memorial features including sculptures, plaques, commemorative trees, water features and 
gardens. Also, recreational landscape spaces and gathering spaces in which the community 
may demonstrate.
Criterion: H Significant people
The central national area has a special association with its designer, Walter Burley Griffin. 
Griffin is an important figure in Australia's cultural history for his overall design of Canberra 
as the Nation's Capital. The special association between the central national area and 
Griffin results from the area being the centrepiece of the planning geometry for Canberra 
and perhaps the only part of his Canberra plan to survive relatively intact. The area has a 
strong association with Marion Mahoney Griffin who prepared the perspective drawings of 
the Vista. The Vista area has a strong association with numerous architects and planners, 
in particular John Smith Murdoch, Chief architect of the Commonwealth Government, and 
Thomas Charles Weston, Superintendent of Parks, Gardens and Afforestation in Canberra, 
and notable planners of the National Capital Development Commission such as Sir John 
Overall, Peter Harrison and Paul Reid.
Attributes

Description:
HISTORY
The Australian Constitution left the location of the Capital to be decided by the new Federal 
Parliament. It declared that Melbourne would be the temporary home for the Federal 
Parliament and public servants until a new city was built at least 100 miles from Sydney. An
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
agreed territory of 903 square miles included the water catchment of the Cotter River and the river 
valley of the Molonglo for the setting for the city. The Department of Home Affairs commenced 
works for services and city planning. In 1910 the Secretary of the Federal Department of Home 
Affairs, David Miller requested permission of Minister O'Malley to conduct a design competition to 
elicit ideas for the city.
At the time the Federal Capital area was proclaimed, the river flats of the Molonglo, Mount Ainslie, 
Camp Hill and Kurrajong Hill had been extensively denuded of vegetation from a long period of 
clearing and grazing. Some exotic trees were established in parts of the area, around structures 
such as Blundell's cottage and St Johns Church and graveyard.
The Canberra Plan
Walter Burley Griffin won the competition for the design of Canberra in 1912. The plan was 
expressed in beautifully rendered illustrations prepared by Griffin's wife Marion Mahoney Griffin as 
plans, elevations and sections painted on silk.
The order of the city was for a great triangle aligned with the mountains which rose above the site. 
The triangle was to be defined by tree-lined avenues and spanned the central basin of an impounded 
lake. The triangle would consist of a series of terraces arranged in the functions of government and 
representing democracy. It was a synthesis of function and design where the Order of the Site (the 
natural environment) and the Order of Functions (the needs of the people) are perfectly integrated 
by specific geometry (Reid 2002). The Capitol was a main feature of the design
In terms of vistas, the Griffin vision was represented in two renderings drawn by Marion Mahony 
Griffin. In the rendering looking from Mt Ainslie towards the Capitol, the drama of the vista focuses 
on the Capitol, the building representing the aspirational forces in Australian national life, with the 
final termination in the mountains beyond. Below the Capitol, the Parliament House and the 
Government departments are terraced down to the Lake providing a symbol of a transparent 
democracy in action. The observer is standing at Mt Ainslie, a point representative of the power and 
influence of nature and the highest point of the vista. Griffin's plan for the ideal city, the 
philosophical triumvirate of humanity, democracy and nature is iconographed along the land axis 
which together with the water axis is the ordering geometry of the vista and the city. Griffin 
envisaged a dense city with a coming together of the population in a Casino (something akin to the 
recreational city gardens in pre war Berlin, Copenhagen, and Stockholm) and Plaisance descending 
from the foot of Mt Ainslie.
Intersected by a busy commercial street, Constitution Avenue, the Plaisance unfolded to the
area designated for cultural activity from which the people could look across the lake (or water axis) 
to the area of national government that was climaxed by the building symbolic of
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
national achievement and aspiration, the Capitol.
Griffin's 1913 land use plan for the central National area indicates his intentions. Moving from 
north to south along the land axis, he proposed a park at the northern end of the land axis, 
public gardens on the north side of the lake, the lake itself (now Lake Burley Griffin), 
government buildings flanking a central terrace court to the south of the lake, Parliament 
House on Camp Hill, the Capitol building on Capital Hill flanked by the Governor General's 
residence to the west and the Prime Minister's residence to the east. The Capitol building was 
not intended to be the Parliament but rather to be for popular reception and ceremonial 
activities or for archives or otherwise to commemorate Australian achievements. Griffin's 
philosophical vision expressed in a remarkable urban planning form has been affected by the 
realities of Australian political and cultural life as well as by the circumstances and 
juxtapositions of historic events. Australian planners following Griffin have rearranged the 
icons to reflect the dominant realities and meanings of Australian life.
Griffin's various plans for the central National area of Canberra all included a basic planning 
framework, which has been constructed and survives to the present. This framework includes 
the land axis, joining Capital Hill and Mount Ainslie, the water axis, the radiating avenues from 
Capital Hill, Commonwealth and Kings Avenues, the arc of Parkes Way, the northern 
punctuation of the land axis by the Australian War Memorial, the roads encircling Capital Hill, 
State and Capital Circles and the southern punctuation of the land axis by the Parliament 
House of 1988. In addition to the alignment of axes and avenues which defined Griffin's city 
plan the triangle was a basic element on which the whole city was built. In his design Griffin 
had created three urban centres connected by main avenues. Capital Hill as the government 
centre, Mt Vernon as the municipal centre and Mt Pleasant as the market centre were integral 
to the plan. The northern avenue, Constitution Avenue, was the municipal axis.
Griffin prepared a preliminary plan in 1913 and a revised plan in 1918 following which the 
Official Plan was gazetted in 1925. Griffin left in 1920 leaving development under the control 
of the Federal Capital Advisory Committee (FCAC) chaired by the planner, John Sulman. The 
Committee had been appointed to complete sufficient permanent buildings to enable 
Parliament to move from Melbourne to Canberra.
Development
Tree planting began in the early years of Canberra's development, and by 1921 some 17,000 
trees were planted (Hendry). Within the Vista area tree planting commenced around 1923 in 
Prospect Parkway, now known as Anzac Parade. Early images show tree planting in a scalloped 
arrangement along the length of the avenue
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
For 3 years from 1925, trees were planted in association with the construction of the Provisional 
Parliament House. The formal structural planting around the House including Cedars, Cypresses and 
Lombardy Poplars was completed for the opening (Hendry). The planting proposals were finalised by 
Charles Weston, Superintendent of Parks, Gardens and Afforestation, and from 1926, carried out by 
his successor Alexander Bruce. The planting design aimed to create through the use of a balanced 
mix of evergreen and deciduous trees, formally shaped grassed vistas and 'outdoor rooms' in scale 
with the Provisional Parliament House. The formally arranged groups of Lombardy Poplars to 
achieve 'sentinel' features at the entrances and the pedestrian reference points in the landscape, is 
attributed to the involvement of John Smith Murdoch, Chief Architect for the Commonwealth 
Government, in the design. Cedars were used at right angles to the Land Axis. Most of the trees 
planted in Parkes Place were exotics with the only eucalypts planted adjacent to the Senate and 
House of Representatives Gardens (Gray 1995).
The first major structure to be placed within the area was the Old Parliament House, then
called the Provisional Parliament House. In 1923 the Commonwealth Parliament agreed to the 
proposed building which was sited in front of Camp Hill, Griffin's intended location of the permanent 
Parliament House. At the time, Griffin protested recognising that if built, the provisional building 
would remove any possibility of a permanent Parliament House being built on Camp Hill. 
Nonetheless the Commonwealth proceeded. In 1925 the Federal Capital Commission (FCC) was 
established under Sir John Butters. The Commission replaced the FCAC. The FCC was responsible 
for moving the public service to Canberra and otherwise establishing the city in time for the opening 
of Parliament House.
A number of other significant projects were undertaken at the same time as the construction of 
(Old) Parliament House, which was designed by John Smith Murdoch and completed in 1927. Either 
side of the Parliament House, private gardens were established for the use of Members of 
Parliament. On either side of Camp Hill, two government office buildings were constructed, known 
as East and West Blocks and these were also completed in 1927. East and West Blocks were also 
designed by Murdoch in a similar style to Old Parliament House.
In 1926 a delegation of the Empire Parliamentary Association visited the new Parliament House and 
planted an avenue of 12 commemorative trees, to mark the event of the first use of the House of 
Representatives. Ten Roman Cypresses (CUPRESSUS SEMPERVIRENS 'STRICTA') were planted at 
right angles to the House with each tree planted by a delegate and marked by a brass plaque. To 
commemorate the opening of Parliament House in 1927, the Duke of York planted a Bunya Pine 
(ARUACARIA BIDWILLI) near Kings Avenue. The Marquis of Salisbury and Mr Arthur Henderson 
planted the Lombardy poplars in the courtyards of the Provisional Parliament House (Pryor and 
Banks 1991, Gray 1995).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
In 1927 the Canberra National Memorials Committee named the area in front of Parliament 
House - Parkes Place, to commemorate Sir Henry Parkes. King Edward, King George and 
Queen Victoria Terraces, and Langton and Walpole Crescents were named for links to the first 
50 years of Federation (Gray 1995).
The Gardens designed and constructed as part of the Old Parliament House Complex was 
conceived by the Federal Capital Advisory Committee in the early1920s and constructed by the 
Federal Capital Commission from the mid 1920s in time for the opening of Parliament in May 
1927. Formal enclosed gardens were the style of the time and James Orwin of the Sydney 
office of the Director of Works for NSW prepared sketch plans that were finalised by Murdoch. 
Most of the trees for the Parliamentary gardens were planted by late 1925. Around the same 
time road patterns for the Parliamentary area following Griffin's concepts were prepared.
Formal rose gardens in front of the House were first proposed by Weston in 1924. The idea 
was finally realised when the National Rose Gardens were established in 1933 by the Canberra 
Horticultural Society in association with the Department of the Interior. The design was 
developed by A. Bruce based on the plan of petals of an open bloom with colours arranged 
from deep red in the central area progressing through yellow, white pink and coppery shades. 
Rose gardens were also commenced around the same time in the Senate and House of 
Representatives Gardens. By 1938, these gardens were established with formal garden beds 
and recreation courts, and surrounded by young cypresses which were later clipped into 
hedges (Patrick and Wallace).
Following the opening of the Provisional Parliament House by the Duke of York on 9 May 1927, 
the area in front of the House was used for official ceremonies for Anzac and Remembrance 
Days with a temporary cenotaph, until the opening of the Australian War Memorial in 1941.
Initially this area had simple landscaping treatment of lawns. Rose gardens were added in the 
1950s, and the car parking area in the forecourt added in the 1960s.
Weston and Murdoch were both given British Empire Awards in 1927 for their contribution to 
the nation.
In 1946 a major tree thinning of the Parliamentary Zone was initiated by Lindsay Pryor, 
Superintendent, Parks and Gardens. All the golden cypresses, white poplars, pin oaks and 
Lawson's cypress on King George Terrace were removed (Gray 1995).
In order to accommodate other government departments, a competition was held in 1924 for 
the design of the Administrative building, flanking the land axis in Parkes, which was to house

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
about eight departments. The building was to be the first in the Parliamentary Triangle and its 
design was considered important because it would influence future buildings in the central National 
area. In 1924, G Sydney Jones won the competition. Work started in 1927 and the foundations 
were completed in 1928. However, work was stopped at this point because of the Depression. There 
were then many delays. The design of the proposed building was modified in 1946, construction 
started again in 1947 and the new design required the demolition of the original foundations. The 
building was substantially completed in 1956. The building is claimed to have been the largest 
Australian office building when completed. It was renamed as the John Gorton Building in 1999.
The major development at the northern end of the land axis was the construction of the Australian 
War Memorial. The site was agreed in 1923 and in 1928 Griffin expressed the view that the 
proposed site was suitable for the memorial. Construction began in 1928 but was not completed 
until 1941.
Although a memorial to King George V was proposed in 1936 it was not until 1941 that the 
architectural part was constructed but the bronze figure was not developed until after World War II. 
It was unveiled in 1953 but attracted criticism for blocking the vista to the Australian War Memorial. 
In 1968 King George Terrace was realigned and the memorial was moved to its current location west 
of the land axis, on a corner of the western part of the National Rose Garden.
In 1955 a Select Senate Committee of Inquiry urged tree planting and landscape works to be 
undertaken in Canberra under the direction of the National Capital Development Commission. The 
Commission sought guidance from landscape designers including Lord William Holford and Dame 
Sylvia Crowe. Holford recommended that a predominantly Australian character be retained around 
Lake Burley Griffin with autumn coloured foliage trees used in a dramatic way. Parliament House 
was to be built on the lakeside with a great forecourt. In 1968 the lakeshore location was rejected 
in favour of Camp Hill or Capital Hill. During the 1960s, the landscaping of the Parliamentary 
Triangle was modified to create more formality in Parkes Place. This included realigning roads, 
installing the four fountains in the pools in the land axis, paving and the relocation King George V 
statue.
The National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) Act of 1957 set in motion a significant phase 
in the development of Canberra with the support of Robert Menzies Liberal government. The report 
of British Town Planner Sir William Holford stressed the need for 'unified design' for Canberra. This 
view was supported by the Senate Select Committee which propagated Holford's concept of a 'park 
like landscape...in the heart of Canberra, in which monumental buildings functioned both as symbols 
of government and of Australian unity'. The visual design of this landscape, the views along the 
main axial lines and avenues as well as the grouping of
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
monumental buildings were considered to be the elements upon which the success of Canberra as a 
city of world standing depended. Holford's recommendations included siting the future houses of 
parliament on the lakeside and developing two monumental buildings on the municipal axis north of 
a new road connection, which became Parkes Way. The NCDC's acceptance of the Holford vision set 
the design context for the completion of Anzac Parade and the construction of the Portal Buildings 
under the direction of NCDC architects and planners.
The Portal Buildings have heritage significance.
After a number of schemes for Canberra's lake, detailed planning of the Lake edges was begun in 
1954. Lake Burley Griffin was created in 1964 by the damming of the Molonglo River by Scrivener 
Dam. It reached its predicted level of 556 metres in the same year. The northern shore of the lake 
between Commonwealth and Kings Avenues was landscaped from about this time to create 
Commonwealth and Kings Parks. In 1970, two vertical features were opened in the central basin of 
the lake. The Carillon, located on Aspen Island in the eastern part of the central basin, was a gift 
from the British Government to mark the fiftieth Jubilee of the founding of Canberra in 1963. In the 
western part of the central basin is the Captain Cook Memorial water jet commissioned by the 
National Capital Development Commission as part of the Cook Bicentenary year. In 1968 a small 
restaurant was built on a corner of the western part of the National Rose Garden.
NCDC architect and landscape architect Gareth Roberts and architect and landscape architect 
Richard Clough collaborated on the design of Anzac Parade and its architectural elements at this 
time. The two Portal Buildings, Anzac Park East and Anzac Park West, were completed in 1965 and 
1966 respectively. With the establishment of the Australian War Memorial in the 1940s, the 
surrounding landscape was imbued with an associated symbolic character. This included the 
creation of Anzac Park and Anzac Parade. Anzac Park became the setting for a series of memorials 
commemorating Australian involvement and sacrifice in war. Anzac Parade was opened by Her 
Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on Anzac Day 1965, the fiftieth anniversary of the landing of the Anzacs 
at Gallipoli. It is the setting for a series of memorials commemorating Australian involvement and 
sacrifice in war and is the major national venue for the Anzac Day March and other ceremonies to 
commemorate those who served Australia in times of conflict. It has a deep symbolism for many 
Australians and its vista, linking the Memorial with Parliament House, adds aesthetic and emotional 
value to the place, which has become part of one of the major cultural landscapes of Australia. The 
notion of a ceremonial space of this grandeur is not found elsewhere in Australia.
Over time the spaces flanking the land axis to the south of the Lake have been filled with
government buildings of varying character. These include the Treasury Building established 1967-
70, the National Library in 1968, the High Court in 1980, National Gallery in 1982 and the National 
Science and Technology Centre in 1988. Associated with the Gallery is the

extensive and significant Sculpture Garden established in 1982.
In 1972 an informal Aboriginal Embassy was established in front of Old Parliament House. The 
Embassy became the focus of a campaign for land and other rights for Aboriginal and Torres Strait 
Islander people. In 1992 the Embassy was re-established.
The most recent major change to the central National area was the construction of a new Parliament 
House on Capital Hill. In 1974, The site of Capital Hill for Parliament House, was chosen by a joint 
sitting of both Houses of Parliament. An Act of Parliament extended Parliamentary jurisdiction over 
work in the Parliamentary Triangle, henceforth known as the Parliamentary Zone. Completed in 
1988, the building has resulted in a number of significant changes to the area. The relocation of the 
Parliament to the new building left the Old Parliament House without its original use. The 
construction of the building also resulted in the levelling of Camp Hill, Griffin's intended location for 
a Parliament House and its incorporation into the broader formal landscape of the new Federation 
Mall. Finally, the new Parliament House involved the construction of a large complex of buildings 
and extensive new landscape areas. The changes affected most of Capital Hill. The winning design, 
by Mitchell, Giurgola and Thorp Architects, considered the land axis of Canberra as the fundamental 
gesture of the City, a line around which all other design has evolved in circular and radial directions 
(Reid 2002).
During 2001-2002 new designed features were constructed across the Land Axis of the Vista 
landscape. These are Commonwealth Place and Reconciliation Place. In addition, a rotunda with 
exhibition, called Magna Carta Place is located to the west of the former Senate Garden. Following 
the construction of Parliament House, emphasis was placed on the landscape of the Parliament 
Zone. The development of Federation Mall with its trees and central space was to balance Anzac 
Parade and to complete the visual Land Axis from Capital Hill to the War Memorial.
Use
By the turn of the century (2000-2001), the area was used for countless public events. These 
include memorial services such as the Anzac Day March and the Dawn Service, public protest 
demonstrations, celebration events, sporting activities, water races, art displays, fireworks and 
large-sale concerts. In addition it is used by people informally for weddings, picnics, and fairs. The 
area is a popular destination for tourists and schoolchildren.
DESCRIPTION
The central National area of Canberra is an extensive cultural landscape comprising buildings, roads, 
parks, tree plantings and a lake. The area is designated for Parliamentary and National

Capital uses. The major features of the area include: Parliament House with its gardens and 
paved areas, State Circle Cutting (geological feature), Old Parliament House and curtilage, 
East Block, West Block and the Dugout, the John Gorton Building, the National Gallery of 
Australia, the High Court of Australia, the High Court - National Gallery precinct, National 
Science and Technology Centre, the National Library of Australia, Treasury Building, National 
Rose Gardens, The Sculpture Garden of the National Gallery, King George V Memorial, 
Aboriginal Embassy, the Portal Buildings, Australian War Memorial and memorials along Anzac 
Parade, Aspen Island, the Carillon, Kings Park, HMAS Canberra Memorial, Merchant Navy 
Memorial, Blundell's Cottage, Commonwealth Park, Kings Park, the Peace Park, Regatta Point 
Exhibition Building and Restaurant, Captain Cook Memorial Water Jet, the Lakeshore 
Promenade, and extensive mature plantings and avenues of trees such as those along Anzac 
Parade. The area also includes fountains, roads, car parks, landscaped areas, a restaurant, 
kiosk and the residence of the Catholic Archbishop. The spaces, particularly the Land Axis, are 
a major feature.
The central National area has a strong sense of symmetry based on the land axis. The 
Parliament House, Old Parliament House and Australian War Memorial are located on the axis. 
In addition, the landscape features of Federation Mall, Parkes Place (the landscape feature not 
the roads) and Anzac Parade are also located on the axis. Other major features in the area are 
generally balanced about the axis such as: East and West Blocks, the gardens of Old 
Parliament House, the Portal Buildings, the eastern and western parts of the National Rose 
Gardens, Administrative and Treasury Buildings, the National Gallery/High Court group and 
the National Library/National Science and Technology Centre group, as well as the Carillon and 
Captain Cook Memorial water jet. The road system also generally reflects the symmetrical 
planning of the area based on the land axis.
The Anzac Parade Memorials comprises two main components, Anzac Parade and Anzac Park. 
Either side of Anzac Parade is bounded by Anzac Park. Treed sloping grassy strips contain 10 
symmetrically placed aprons prepared for national memorials. In 2002 there were 11 
memorials on Anzac Parade, tributes to the men and women of the Australian military. These 
memorials are: (1) the Australian Hellenic Memorial, Limestone Avenue intersection, (2) the 
Australian Army Memorial, near Currong Street, (3) the Australian National Korean Memorial, 
near Currong Street, (4) the Australian Vietnam forces National Memorial, opposite 
Booroondara Street, (5) the Desert Mounted Corps Memorial, opposite Amaroo Street 
(commonly known as the Light Horse Memorial), (6) the New Zealand Memorial (7) the Rats of 
Tobruk Memorial , opposite (5), (8) Royal Australian Air Force Memorial, opposite Page Street,
(9) the Australian Service Nurses Memorial, (10) the Royal Australian Navy Memorial, and
(11) Kemal Ataturk Memorial, Fairbairn Avenue intersection.

The array of mature tree plantings are all regarded as important. Some are classified as 
notable by Pryor and Banks (1991) and these include CALOCEDRUS DECURRENS on King 
George Terrace planted in 1927, CUPRESSUS ARIZONICA planted in 1926 on King George 
Terrace, EUCALYTUS GLOBULUS at the Australian War Memorial, E. MAIDENII group planted c 
1927. Commemorative trees in the Parkes area, include the CUPRESSUS SEMPERVIRENS 
'Stricta' planted in 1926 by nine members of the Empire Parliamentary Association, 
ARAUCARIA Bidwilli PLANTED BY THE duke of York in 1927 to commemorate his visit to 
Canberra to open the first Parliament House and CUPRESSUS ARIZONICA, planted by the wife 
of the then United States President, Mrs Lady Bird Johnson, at the time of their visit to 
Canberra in 1966. Within Commonwealth Park are a QUERCUS ROBUR planted by Princess 
Marina in 1964, and a CURRESSUS GLABRA planted by Mrs Lady Bird Johnson. Within the 
curtilage of the Australian War Memorial is a PINUS HALPENSIS planted by the Duke of 
Gloucester in 1934, believed to have been raised from seed from a cone collected from Lone 
Pine Ridge, Gallipolli in 1915. Also in curtilage is a EUCALYPTUS NICHOLII to replace the E. 
PAUCOFORA planted by Queen Elizabeth in 1954 to mark the begining of the Remembrance 
Driveway to Sydney (Pryor and Banks 1991).
History: Not Available
Condition and Integrity:
The central National area is an extensive cultural landscape with a variety of landscape and 
building features. Individual elements vary in their condition and integrity. At a general level, 
the area is in fair to good condition. The values relating to the cultural landscape design and 
special association with Griffin are degraded by the changes made over time to Griffin's plan. 
The location of Old Parliament House, removal of Camp Hill, location of the new Parliament 
House and parts of the road layout as constructed are all variations from Griffin's plan. Given 
these changes, the area displays only a poor to medium level of integrity with regard to these 
values. In 1994 the National Capital Planning Authority released details of the Central National 
Area Design Study. This includes proposals for significant changes to the area.
Location:
About 260ha, comprising the whole of the area bounded by the northern alignment of State 
Circle, the western alignment of Kings Avenue, the southern alignment of Parkes Way and the 
eastern alignment of Commonwealth Avenue, excluding the Archbishops Residence and 
grounds being Block 1 Section 2 Parkes; the whole of Anzac Parade and Anzac Park and the 
whole of Section 39, Campbell.

Eastern Precinct Vegetation at Australian War Memorial – Potential for 
Natural Heritage Values
Neil Urwin, Griffin Associates Environment
May 2008
At the commencement of landscaping at the AWM site, the woodland of the lower 
slopes of Mt Ainslie survived over the north-eastern corner of the site. The 
remainder of the site was cleared. This remaining woodland on both sides of Treloar 
Crescent is shown in the top right of the 1940 aerial photo, six years after the 
ceremonial planting of the ‘Lone Pine’ in 1934 (top left of photo). The 1952 aerial 
photo shows the early landscaping activities along Treloar Crescent, Limestone 
Avenue and parts of the western precinct of the Memorial - with the woodland 
remnant still present.

Since this early period, extensive tree planting, clearing and replanting has taken 
place to achieve the current landscaping pattern.
The existing vegetation in the eastern precinct was surveyed in March 2008 and 
mapped on a recent aerial image of the site. A large number of native and exotic 
species were identified. A number of these species are indigenous to the area and 
could have existed on the site as part of the grassy woodland on the lower slopes of 
Mt Ainslie grading into the grasslands of the Limestone Plains. These are shown in 
the following table and at Figure 3.

The species identified as indigenous to the site are those which characterise the 
present woodland vegetation abutting the AWM site on the north side of Treloar 
Crescent. The species possibly indigenous to the site are those which are marginal 
to the woodland community (either occurring in the forest form on the mid and upper 
slopes of Mt Ainslie, or downhill of the woodlands on the margins of the grassland 
plain).
Figure 4 shows the present site vegetation overlain on the 1952 aerial photo. This 
shows that, of the indigenous species currently on site, only some individuals of 
Eucalyptus melliodora, Eucalyptus bridgesiana and Eucalyptus polyanthemos are 
currently growing in locations where remnant woodland existed at the time of the 
commencement of site landscaping in the area.
Examination of these locations on site showed that only two individuals of Eucalyptus 
melliodora south-east of the C.E.W. Bean Building and a small group of Eucalyptus 
bridgesiana at the intersection of Treloar Crescent and Fairburn Avenue were mature 
enough to have been present, albeit as saplings only, in the original woodland group 
or to have grown in situ from seeds from this group. See Figure 5. All other trees, 
either because of their comparatively young age or because they are species that do 
not naturally occur in the area, are considered to be planted trees.

Figure 5. Trees which may have links to the original woodland on site.
These trees (the two Eucalyptus melliodora trees and the small group of Eucalyptus 
bridgesiana) are insufficient to be considered remnants of the original woodland 
community on site and they now exist in isolation in an artificial parkland environment. 
They are therefore not items of natural heritage significance when measured against 
the criteria for Commonwealth heritage listing. Instead, they may reflect a decision, 
on the part of the landscapers, to retain a link with the original vegetation of the 
locality and thus their value relates more to the values of the created cultural 
landscape.
Although common practice at that time of creating the AWM landscape was to source 
all landscape planting material from the Canberra Parks and Gardens nurseries, 
there was also a concept, introduced by Pryor, of ‘planting deciduous species on the 
plains and natives on the slopes leading up to the eucalypt covered hills’. The 
recognition and use of the woodland species on the site would have been in line with 
this concept and may have been originally more extensive, with mortality and site 
development works over the years reducing it to its present state.
However, the dominant landscaping theme of the Eastern Precinct, undertaken over 
the same period, was the dense plantings of Eucalyptus bicostata , E. maidenii and E. 
viminalis species around the perimeter and in numerous stands within the Precinct.
These introduced native species have isolated the indigenous species from any link 
with the Mt Ainslie woodlands.
