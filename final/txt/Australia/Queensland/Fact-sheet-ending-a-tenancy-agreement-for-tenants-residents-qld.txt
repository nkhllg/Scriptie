Ending a tenancy agreement for tenants/residents 
The Residential Tenancies and Rooming Accommodation Act 2008 (the Act) is the law that governs renting a residential 
property in Queensland. This fact sheet contains information and a summary of how the Act applies but should not be 
relied on as legal advice for specific residential tenancies. 
For ease of reading, tenants and residents will be referred to as tenants in this fact sheet. The term tenancy refers to all 
tenancies including general tenancies and rooming accommodation. The term managing parties includes lessors, lessor’s 
agents, property owners, property managers and accommodation providers. 
Overview 
Tenancy agreements can only be ended in accordance with the Act. There are processes that must be followed to 
correctly end an agreement, including using the approved form to provide reasons for ending the agreement and allowing 
the right amount of time for the notice period. 
From 1 October 2022, tenants have a wider range of reasons they can specify for ending a tenancy. 
Reasons tenants can give to end an agreement 
If a tenant is experiencing domestic and family violence and needs to end their tenancy and/or obtain their bond refund, 
there are options available.  For more information, refer to our Domestic and family violence – information for tenants fact 
sheet or Domestic and family violence – information for residents fact sheet. 
Tenants can give notice of their intention to end a tenancy for one of the following reasons: 
• Without grounds (without specific reason) 
o 
Tenants can end an agreement (fixed term or periodic) without giving a reason. However, a fixed term 
agreement cannot be ended before the agreement’s end date, unless both parties agree. 
o 
If the tenant ends an agreement early (before the agreement end date) by giving a Notice of intention to leave 
(Form 13), they are breaking the lease and may have to pay compensation. Reletting costs for fixed-term 
agreements are calculated based on how much of the lease has expired. The specific reletting costs depend 
on how much of the agreed tenancy duration has passed when a tenant/resident vacated: 
% of lease that has expired 
Reletting cost 
Less than 25% 
4 weeks rent 
25% to less than 50% 
3 weeks rent 
50% to less than 75% 
2 weeks rent 
75% or more 
1 weeks rent 
o 
For agreements up to 3 years it's the lower amount of the specified reletting costs or the rent until a new 
tenant/resident moves in. 
Customers may find it helpful to use the online calculator for guidelines on calculating reletting costs. 
• Unremedied breach 
o 
Tenants can end the agreement if the managing party does not remedy a breach after the Notice to remedy 
breach (Form 11) process has been followed. 
o 
It is important to note that ending a fixed term agreement for an unremedied breach does not necessarily 
mean that the tenant will not be ordered to pay compensation to the managing party for the early termination 
of the fixed term agreement. Whether compensation would be payable is determined by the seriousness of 
the unremedied breach and other relevant factors. 
• Non-liveability 
o 
Tenants can end the agreement if the property is partly or wholly destroyed or if the property can no longer be 
used legally as a dwelling. This does not apply if the non-liveability is caused by one of the parties breaking 
the agreement (e.g. by causing extensive damage). 
o 
The notice must be given within one month of the property becoming non-liveable and the agreement can 
end on the day the notice is given.

• 
Death of a co-tenant (does not apply to short term moveable dwellings) 
o 
The tenant may give a Notice of intention to leave (Form 13) if another tenant under the residential tenancy 
agreement dies and continuing with the agreement would be impractical for the tenant or cause them 
excessive hardship.  
• Death of a sole tenant (tenant’s representative) 
o 
If a sole tenant dies, the tenant’s personal representative or relative can negotiate with the managing party to 
end the tenancy. The date the agreement ends depends on the action taken.  
 
The tenant’s personal representative can issue a notice to the managing party or the managing party can 
issue a notice to the tenant’s representative. 
 
Parties can negotiate a mutually agreed date. 
 
If no notice is given or no agreement is made, the tenancy ends one month (or 14 days for rooming 
accommodation) after the tenant’s death, or by a Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal 
(QCAT) order. 
• 
Managing party’s intention to sell property (does not apply to rooming accommodation) 
o 
The tenant can end the agreement if the property is for sale within the first two months of the tenancy starting 
and they had not been informed in writing at the time they signed the agreement. 
o 
The tenant has until two weeks after the first two months of the tenancy to advise they want to leave. 
• 
Entitlement to student accommodation ends (does not apply to moveable dwellings) 
o 
This section applies if the property is used for student accommodation and the tenant’s entitlement to occupy 
the property or room depends on the tenant being a student.  
o 
Student accommodation means properties primarily used to provide accommodation to persons who are 
students. Student means a person enrolled in a course that, under the Social Security Act 1991 
(Commonwealth) section 569B, is an approved course of education or study for section 569A(b) of that Act.  
o 
If the tenant stops being a student, the tenant may give a Notice of intention to leave (Form 13) 
• Condition of property (does not apply to short term moveable dwellings) 
o 
The tenant may give a Notice of intention to leave (Form 13) within the first seven days of occupying the 
property under the residential tenancy agreement if the: 
 
property is not fit for the tenant to live in 
 
property or its inclusions are not in good repair 
 
managing party is in breach of a law dealing with issues about the health or safety of persons using or 
entering the property 
 
property, or its inclusions, do not comply with the prescribed minimum housing standards (only effective 
once minimum housing standards apply to the property. Minimum housing standards came into effect  
for new and renewed tenancies from 1 September 2023 and commence for all remaining tenancies on  
1 September 2024). 
o 
The tenant may not give a Notice of intention to leave (Form 13) under this ground if the circumstances 
mentioned above were caused by an action or failure of the tenant. 
• 
Managing party’s failure to comply with repair order (does not apply to rooming accommodation) 
o 
The tenant may give a Notice of intention to leave (Form 13) for this reason if all of the following apply: 
 
a repair order applies to the managing party 
 
the repair order requires repairs to be carried out to the property, or its inclusions, by a stated date 
 
the managing party fails to comply with the repair order by the stated date. 
• 
Managing party’s failure to comply with a QCAT order (does not apply to rooming accommodation) 
o 
The tenant may give a Notice of intention to leave (Form 13) if the managing party has failed to comply with  
a Queensland Civil and Administrative Tribunal (QCAT) order. 
• Compulsory acquisition (does not apply to rooming accommodation) 
o 
Tenants can give a Notice of intention to leave (Form 13) if the property has been appropriated or acquired 
compulsorily by an authority. 
• 
End of agreed short tenancy period (only applies to moveable dwellings) 
o 
The tenant may give a Notice of intention to leave (Form 13) for this reason at the end of the base period. 
o 
If a short tenancy (extension) statement has been made, the end of the extended period.

A tenancy agreement can also be ended if both the tenant and the managing party mutually agree. It is recommended 
that this be put in writing with the agreed end date specified and signed. 
Important: the correct notice periods must be provided when issuing a notice. For more details, refer to the Notice periods 
for ending a tenancy webpage. 
Termination orders by QCAT for misrepresentation 
Within the first three months in which the tenant occupies the property under the residential tenancy agreement, the 
tenant may apply to QCAT for a termination order because the managing party gave the tenant false or misleading 
information about any of the below: 
• 
the condition of the property or its inclusions 
• 
the services provided for the property 
• 
a matter relating to the property that is likely to affect the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the property 
• 
the agreement or any other document the managing party must give the tenant under the Act, such as body 
corporate by-laws that apply to the property 
• 
the right and obligations of the tenant or the managing party under the Act. 
The tenant does not need to issue a Notice of intention to leave (Form 13) before applying to QCAT. However, they must 
lodge a request for free dispute resolution with the RTA via the Tenancy Dispute Resolution Web Service or using the 
Dispute resolution request (Form 16) prior to applying to QCAT. 
In deciding if the false and misleading information justifies a termination order, QCAT will consider: 
• 
the extent to which the false and misleading information:  
o 
induced the tenant to enter into the agreement 
o 
misrepresented the condition of the property/room and its inclusions 
o 
misrepresented the services provided for the property/room 
o 
adversely affected the tenant in exercising a right under the Act 
o 
adversely affected the tenant’s quiet enjoyment of the property 
• 
the adverse effects likely to be suffered by the tenant or other persons if the agreement were not terminated 
• 
any other matter QCAT considers relevant. 
Disputes about ending agreements 
The RTA encourages self-resolution of disputes about ending agreements. Parties should attempt to resolve the dispute 
themselves by talking to each other and finding out about their rights and responsibilities. If they cannot reach an agreement, 
the parties can request free RTA dispute resolution via RTA Web Services or by submitting a paper Dispute resolution 
request (Form 16). If no agreement is reached, the RTA will issue a Notice of unresolved dispute for the party to apply to 
QCAT for a decision.
