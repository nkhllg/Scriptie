a development permit for a material change of use of
premises is necessary under the Planning Act for the
carrying out of the changed activity; and
(c)

section 125(8) in the application for the environmental
authority, an application can not be made to extend the term of
the authority.
(4)
Despite section 224, an amendment application for an
environmental authority for a petroleum activity can not be

Progressive certification for 
resource activities
Division 1
Preliminary
318Z
What is progressive certification
(1)
The administering authority may, under this division, certify
that a particular area within a relevant tenure for a resource
project has been rehabilitated under all relevant requirements
of—
(a)
this Act; and
(b)
the environmental authority under which the resource
project is authorised; and
(c)
a PRCP schedule applying to the activities carried out
under the environmental authority; and
(d)
a relevant guideline or other document made under this
Act.
(2)
The certification is a progressive certification for the relevant
tenure.
(3)
The area the subject of the progressive certification is a
certified area for the relevant tenure.
318ZA Effect of progressive certification
(1)
If progressive certification has been given for a relevant
tenure, the requirements mentioned in section 318Z(1) are
taken to have been complied with for the certified area for the
tenure.
(2)
Subsection (1) applies despite another provision of this Act or
any change in the requirements.

(3)
However, this section is subject to section 318ZB.
318ZB Continuing responsibility of holder relating to certified 
area
(1)
This section applies if progressive certification has been given
for a relevant tenure.
(2)
The holder of the environmental authority to which the
relevant tenure relates must maintain the certified area for the
relevant tenure under the conditions of the authority, or
rehabilitation milestones or management milestones under a
PRCP schedule, in force when the certification was given (the
existing conditions).
(3)
Any change to the conditions of the environmental authority,
or rehabilitation milestones or management milestones under
the schedule, is of no effect to the extent it purports to impose
a more stringent obligation for the certified area than an
obligation applying under the existing conditions or
milestones.
Example of a change to impose a more stringent requirement—
A change to an existing condition to require rehabilitation to alter a
gradient to a lower slope is more stringent because of the necessarily
increased costs of recontouring the gradient.
(4)
The obligation under subsection (2) ends on the last of the
following to happen—
(a)
the surrender under resource legislation of the relevant
tenure, or part of the relevant tenure;
(b)
the environmental authority or PRCP schedule ends or
ceases to have effect;
(c)
if the existing conditions include a condition requiring
compliance with an obligation after the authority ends
or ceases to have effect—compliance with the condition.

General environmental duty
(1)
A person must not carry out any activity that causes, or is
likely to cause, environmental harm unless the person takes all
reasonably practicable measures to prevent or minimise the
harm (the general environmental duty).
Note—
See section 24(3) (Effect of Act on other rights, civil remedies etc.).
(2)
A person commits an offence if—
(a)
the person contravenes the general environmental duty
in relation to an activity; and

the contravention causes, or is likely to cause, serious or
material environmental harm.
Maximum penalty—
(a)
if the offence is committed wilfully—4,500 penalty
units or 2 years imprisonment; or

Environmental Protection Act 1994
Chapter 7 Environmental management
Current as at 27 September 2024
Page 331
Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel
(a)
the contravention arises only because the person does an
act that causes, or is likely to cause, environmental
harm; and
(b)
either—
(i)
a thing mentioned in section 493A(2) authorises
the act to be done and provides for reasonably
practicable measures to be taken in relation to the
doing of the act; or
(ii)
in doing the act, the person complies with a code of
practice that applies in relation to the doing of the
act.
(4)
In deciding the measures required to be taken under
subsection (1), regard must be had to, for example—
(a)
the nature of the harm or potential harm; and
(b)
the sensitivity of the receiving environment; and
(c)
the current state of technical knowledge for the activity;
and
(d)
the likelihood of successful application of the different
measures that might be taken; and
(e)
the financial implications of the different measures as
they would relate to the type of activity.
(5)
Also, in deciding whether the general environmental duty is
contravened regard may be had to whether a person fails, for
example, to do any of the following in carrying out an
activity—
(a)
install, use and maintain plant, equipment, processes or
systems in a way that minimises risks of environmental
harm that may arise in connection with the activity;
(b)
use and maintain systems for the identification,
assessment and control of risks of environmental harm
that may arise in connection with the activity, and for
the evaluation of the effectiveness of controls;

minimises risks of environmental harm that may arise in
connection with the activity;
(d)
use and maintain systems to ensure that information,
instruction, supervision and training is provided to any
person engaging in the activity in a way that minimises
risks of environmental harm that may arise in
connection with the activity.
(6)
A reference in subsection (3) to an act includes an omission
and a reference to doing an act includes making an omission.
319A
Special provision for activities involving relevant 
industrial chemicals
(1)
This section applies to a person carrying out an activity that
involves a relevant industrial chemical.
(2)
The person is taken not to comply with the general
environmental duty unless the person complies with any risk
management measures for the chemical under a scheduling
decision under the Industrial Chemicals Environmental
Management (Register) Act 2021 (Cwlth).
(3)
Subsection (2)—
(a)
does not limit the application of section 319 to the
person; and

reasonably practicable measures to prevent or minimise
environmental harm caused, or likely to be caused, by
the activity.

relation to the same, or substantially the same, conduct as the

outcome document is different to the outcome for the land
under the proposed PRCP schedule, a submission under

the area.
(4)
