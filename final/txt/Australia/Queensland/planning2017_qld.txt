Rounding of amounts expressed as numbers of fee units
(1)
This section applies for working out the amount of a fee or
charge expressed in this regulation as a number of fee units.
(2)
For the purpose of the Acts Interpretation Act 1954,
section 48C(3), the amount is to be rounded to the nearest
dollar (rounding one-half upwards).
Example—
If a fee were 3,500 fee units and the value of a fee unit were $1.015, the
number of dollars obtained by multiplying 3,500 by $1.015 would be
$3,552.50. Because $3,552.50 is halfway between $3,552 and $3,553, it
is rounded upwards, so the amount of the fee would be $3,553.
