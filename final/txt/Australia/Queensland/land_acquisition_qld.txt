Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel
Acquisition of Land Act 1967
An Act to consolidate and amend the law relating to the
acquisition of land for public works and other public purposes,
and for other purposes
Part 1
Preliminary
1
Short title
This Act may be cited as the Acquisition of Land Act 1967.
2
Definitions
The dictionary in schedule 2 defines particular words used in
this Act.
3
Meaning of multi-parcel purpose
(1)
Land is taken under this Act for a multi-parcel purpose if, to
carry out the particular purpose for which the land is taken, it
is necessary to take, under this Act, more than 1 parcel of
land.
Examples of multi-parcel purposes—
roads and railways for which it is necessary to take, under this Act,
more than 1 parcel of land
(2)
For subsection (1), it does not matter whether—
(a)
the parcels of land are owned by the same person or
different persons; or
(b)
the same person or different persons are entitled to claim
compensation under this Act for the taking of the
parcels of land.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[s 4]
Acquisition of Land Act 1967
Part 1 Preliminary
Page 6
 Current as at 22 July 2024
Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel
(3)
In this section—
parcel, of land, means—
(a)
a separate lot or parcel in a plan of survey registered, or
deposited for registration, in the land registry or given to
the chief executive (surveys); or
(b)
an easement; or
(c)
other land that is described in a way that is sufficient to
substantially identify the land.
4
Relationship with other Acts
(1)
This section applies if another Act provides for land to be
taken under this Act, even though this Act would not
otherwise apply to the land.
Example—
The Native Title (Queensland) Act 1993 provides for native title rights
and interests relating to land, for example, unallocated State land under
the Land Act 1994, to be acquired under this Act even though this Act
would not otherwise apply to unallocated State land.
(2)
Despite the other Act, sections 9(7) and 15D do not apply to
the taking of land if the land includes Aboriginal or Torres
Strait interests.
(3)
For subsection (2), land includes Aboriginal or Torres Strait
Islander interests if—
(a)
native title rights and interests exist for the land; or
(b)
the land is Aboriginal land or transferable land under the
Aboriginal Land Act 1991; or
(c)
the land is Torres Strait Islander land or transferable
land under the Torres Strait Islander Land Act 1991.
4A
Taking non-native title right or interest
(1)
This section applies to the taking of a non-native title right or
interest if—

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[s 4A]
Acquisition of Land Act 1967
Part 1 Preliminary
Current as at 22 July 2024
Page 7
Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel
(a)
the taking happens under a compulsory acquisition Act;
and
(b)
the taking under the compulsory acquisition Act—
(i)
is authorised under the Native Title (Queensland)
Act 1993, section 144(1)(b); or
(ii)
is authorised under the compulsory acquisition Act
but happens at the same time as the taking under
that Act of native title rights and interests as
authorised under the Native Title (Queensland) Act
1993, section 144(1)(a).
(2)
The compulsory acquisition Act, including to the extent
appropriate this Act, must be applied to the taking of the
non-native title right or interest to the greatest practicable
extent as if the right or interest were land to which the
compulsory acquisition Act otherwise applies.
(3)
However, when the taking has effect, despite any compulsory
acquisition Act, including any other provision of this Act, the
right or interest is completely extinguished to the extent it
relates to land stated in the gazette resumption notice for the
taking.
(4)
Without limiting subsection (1), taking that happens under a
compulsory acquisition Act includes taking under a
compulsory acquisition Act other than this Act if either of the
following applies—
(a)
the 
compulsory 
acquisition 
Act 
authorises 
a
constructing authority to take land under this Act;
(b)
the 
compulsory 
acquisition 
Act 
authorises 
a
constructing authority to take land under that Act but
requires provisions of this Act to be applied to any
aspect of the taking.
(5)
In this section—
gazette resumption notice, for the taking of a right or interest,
includes any instrument giving effect to the taking.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part 1 Preliminary

Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel
4B
Taking non-native title right or interest that is a resource 
interest
(1)
This section applies to the taking of a non-native title right or
interest if—
(a)
it is a taking to which section 4A applies; and
(b)
the right or interest is a resource interest.
(2)
The entity taking the resource interest must give the relevant
chief executive for the resource interest a written notice that—
(a)
states the details of the extinguishment of the resource
interest; and
(b)
asks for the extinguishment to be recorded in the
appropriate register kept by the chief executive; and
(c)
is accompanied by a certified copy of the gazette
resumption notice mentioned in section 4A(3).
(3)
Compensation to be paid under the compulsory acquisition
Act in relation to the taking of the resource interest is limited
in the way provided for in the resource compensation
provision for the resource interest.
Example—
If the resource interest is a mining tenement interest under the Mineral
Resources Act 1989, on an application of section 10AAD of that Act,
allowance can not be made for the value of minerals known or supposed
to be on or below the surface of, or mined from, the land the subject of
the mining tenement interest.
(4)
In this section—
relevant chief executive, for a resource interest, means the
chief executive of the department administering the resource
interest compensation provision for the resource interest.

General
5
Purposes for which land may be taken
(1)
Land may be taken under and subject to this Act—
(a)
where the constructing authority is the Crown, for any
purpose set out in schedule 1; or
(b)
where 
the 
constructing 
authority 
is 
a 
local
government—
(i)
for any purpose set out in schedule 1 which the
local government may lawfully carry out; or
(ii)
for any purpose, including any function of local
government, which the local government is
authorised or required by a provision of an Act
other than this Act to carry out; or
(c)
in the case of a constructing authority other than the
Crown or a local government—
(i)
for any purpose set out in schedule 1 which that
constructing authority may lawfully carry out; or
(ii)
for any purpose which that constructing authority
is authorised or required, by a provision of an Act
other than this Act, to carry out.
(2)
The power to take, under and subject to this Act, land for a
purpose (the primary purpose) includes power to take from
time to time as required land either for the primary purpose or

(b)
indicates only the type of activity or other thing to which
a purpose mentioned in the part ordinarily relates; and
(c)
does not limit the matters to which a purpose mentioned
in the part may relate.
6
Easements
(1)
When for any purpose it is not necessary that the constructing
authority should take the whole estate in any land, but it is
sufficient for such purpose to take an easement, the
constructing authority may take such easement only and for
that purpose the provisions of this Act shall apply as if the
easement were land.
(2)
Upon application in that behalf, payment of the prescribed
fees, and the production to the land registry of the gazette
copy of the gazette resumption notice, whereby an easement is
taken affecting land under the Land Title Act 1994, the
registrar of titles shall register such easement as prescribed by
that Act, notwithstanding that such easement is not being
annexed to or used and enjoyed together with any other land.
(3)
The taking of an easement over land does not extinguish any
interest in the land existing immediately before the easement
is taken.
Division 2
Taking other than by agreement
7
Notice of intention to take land
(1)
A constructing authority which proposes to take any land shall
serve as prescribed by this section the notice (a notice of
intention to resume) prescribed by this section.
(2)
A notice of intention to resume shall be served upon any and
every person who to the knowledge of the constructing
authority—
(a)
will be entitled to claim compensation under this Act in

of, and shown on a building units plan under, the Building
Units and Group Titles Act 1980, the constructing authority
need only serve the notice on—
(a)

Management Act 1997, the constructing authority need only
serve the notice on—
(a)
the body corporate under that Act for the community
titles scheme; and
(b)
each entity, other than the body corporate or an owner of
a lot in the community titles scheme for the common
property, who to the knowledge of the constructing
authority has an interest in the common property.
(2C)
Subsection (2D) applies if the constructing authority gives a
body corporate mentioned in subsection (2A) or (2B) a notice
of intention to resume or a notice amending a notice of
intention to resume (each a relevant notice).
(2D)
The body corporate must ensure a copy of the relevant notice

corporate given to each of its members after receiving the
relevant notice.
(3)

with the land registry a notice of the amendment or
discontinuance.
(4B)
For the purpose of subsection (4A), notwithstanding that a
constructing authority has not served notice under section 16,
it shall be deemed to discontinue a resumption if an
application under section 9(1) has not been made within the
time stated in section 9(2).
(5)
The failure by the constructing authority to serve upon the
owner a notice of intention to resume, where such failure is
due to circumstances beyond the control of the constructing
authority, or the failure of the constructing authority to serve
upon any person other than the owner a notice of intention to
resume, or the failure of the constructing authority to observe
subsection (4), shall not prejudice any gazette resumption
notice made under this Act, with respect to any land, and any
land included in the notice shall be taken in terms of the notice
notwithstanding any such failure, and the failure by the
constructing authority to serve upon any person entitled
thereto any notice as prescribed by this Act shall not
invalidate the continuance or discontinuance of any
resumption.

In subsection (5)—
owner means, in the case of land under the Land Title Act
1994, the person registered as the proprietor in fee simple at
the date of the notice of intention to resume.

resume land who has objected as prescribed to the taking (the
objector) shall not be entitled to be heard in support of the
grounds of the objection unless the person stated in the
objection that the person desired to be so heard and appears,
in person or by counsel, solicitor or agent, at the time and
place specified in the notice.
(2)
The constructing authority shall consider the grounds of
objection to the taking of any land and—

(2A)
If upon such consideration, the constructing authority is of
opinion that the resumption should be discontinued or that the
notice of intention to resume should be amended, the
constructing authority may discontinue the resumption or
amend the notice of intention to resume.
(2B)
However, a notice of intention to resume shall not be amended
so as to include therein land additional to the land the subject
thereof.
(3)
If the constructing authority amends the notice of intention to
resume, the objector can not again object to the taking of the
land as provided for under the amended notice if the owner of
the land (whether or not the owner is the objector) agrees to
the amendment.
9
Ways in which land is to be taken
(1)
If within the time stated in the notice of intention to resume no
objection is made or if, after due consideration of all

proposed to be taken, the constructing authority may apply to
the relevant Minister that the land be taken as prescribed by
this section.
