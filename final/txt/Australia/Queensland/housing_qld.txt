community housing services; and
(b)
to promote confidence in the good governance of
registered providers of community housing services, in

Meaning of primary jurisdiction
(1)

registrar of the provider’s new primary jurisdiction must—

record the new primary jurisdiction on the national
register.
(4)
For subsection (1)(a), a community housing service provided
by a national provider, or intended to be provided by a
potential provider, in a jurisdiction other than a participating

most of the national provider’s or potential provider’s
community housing services are, or will be, provided.
