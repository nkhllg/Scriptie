Australian Accounting Standard AASB 1060 General Purpose Financial Statements – Simplified Disclosures for For-
Profit and Not-for-Profit Tier 2 Entities (as amended) is set out in paragraphs 1 – 243 and Appendices A – C.  All the 
paragraphs have equal authority.  Paragraphs in bold type state the main principles.  Terms defined in Appendix A are 
in italics the first time they appear in the Standard.  AASB 1060 is to be read in the context of other Australian 
Accounting Standards, including AASB 1048 Interpretation of Standards, which identifies the Australian Accounting 
Interpretations, and AASB 1057 Application of Australian Accounting Standards.  In the absence of explicit guidance, 
AASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors provides a basis for selecting and 
applying accounting policies.

STANDARD
Accounting Standard AASB 1060
The Australian Accounting Standards Board made Accounting Standard AASB 1060 General Purpose Financial 
Statements – Simplified Disclosures for For-Profit and Not-for-Profit Tier 2 Entities under section 334 of the 
Corporations Act 2001 on 6 March 2020.
This compiled version of AASB 1060 applies to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2025.  It incorporates 
relevant amendments contained in other AASB Standards made by the AASB up to and including 7 March 2024 (see 
Compilation Details).
Accounting Standard AASB 1060
General Purpose Financial Statements – Simplified Disclosures for For-
Profit and Not-for-Profit Tier 2 Entities
Objective
1
This Standard establishes disclosure requirements applicable to entities that are preparing general purpose 
financial statements and elect to apply the Tier 2 reporting requirements under AASB 1053 Application of 
Tiers of Australian Accounting Standards. 
2
Except to the extent specifically addressed in this Standard, the definitions and presentation requirements of 
other Australian Accounting Standards continue to apply. Entities are permitted to refer to other Standards 
for guidance on the requirements in this Standard, including AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, 
AASB 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements, 
AASB 107 Statement of Cash Flows and AASB 124 Related Party Disclosures.
Scope
3
This Standard applies to all entities that elect to apply Tier 2: Australian Accounting Standards – Simplified 
Disclosures under AASB 1053, including those that present consolidated financial statements in accordance 
with AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and those that present separate financial statements in 
accordance with AASB 127 Separate Financial Statements. However, this Standard does not apply to the 
structure and content of condensed interim financial statements prepared in accordance with AASB 134 
Interim Financial Reporting.
4
Entities applying this Standard are required to apply all the recognition and measurement requirements in 
Australian Accounting Standards1 and apply this Standard in relation to disclosure requirements only.
5
This Standard uses terminology that is suitable for profit-oriented entities, including public sector business 
entities. If entities with not-for-profit activities in the private sector or the public sector apply this Standard, 
they may need to amend the descriptions used for particular line items in the financial statements and for the 
financial statements themselves.
6
Similarly, entities that do not have equity as defined in AASB 132 Financial Instruments: Presentation (eg 
some mutual funds) and entities whose share capital is not equity (eg some co-operative entities) may need 
to adapt the financial statement presentation of members’ or unitholders’ interests.
7
AusCF paragraphs and footnotes included in this Standard apply only to:
(a)
not-for-profit entities; and
(b)
for-profit entities that are not applying the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting (as 
identified in AASB 1048 Interpretation of Standards). 
Such entities are referred to as ‘AusCF entities’. For AusCF entities, the term ‘reporting entity’ is defined in 
AASB 1057 Application of Australian Accounting Standards and Statement of Accounting Concepts SAC 1 
Definition of the Reporting Entity also applies. For-profit entities applying the Conceptual Framework for 
1
The term ‘Australian Accounting Standards’ refers to Standards (including Interpretations) made by the AASB that apply to any reporting 
period beginning on or after 1 January 2005. In this context, the term encompasses Australian Accounting Standards – Simplified 
Disclosures, which some entities are permitted to apply in accordance with AASB 1053 Application of Tiers of Australian Accounting 
Standards in preparing general purpose financial statements.

Financial Reporting (as set out in paragraph Aus1.1 of the Conceptual Framework) shall not apply AusCF 
paragraphs or footnotes.
Tier 2 disclosures
Financial Statement Presentation2
Scope
8
This section explains fair presentation of financial statements, what compliance with Australian Accounting 
Standards, including this Standard, requires and what a complete set of financial statements is. [IFRS for 
SMEs Standard paragraph 3.1]
Fair presentation
9
Financial statements shall present fairly the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an 
entity. Fair presentation requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and 
conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses set out in the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting: 
(a)
The application of the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian Accounting 
Standards and the disclosures in this Standard, with additional disclosure when necessary, is 
presumed to result in financial statements that achieve a fair presentation of the financial position, 
financial performance and cash flows of Tier 2 entities.
(b)
As explained in paragraph 13 of AASB 1053, this Standard does not apply to an entity with public 
accountability.
The additional disclosures referred to in (a) are necessary when compliance with the specific requirements in 
this Standard is insufficient to enable users to understand the effect of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance. [Based on IFRS for SMEs 
Standard paragraph 3.2]
AusCF9
Notwithstanding paragraph 9, in respect of AusCF entities, financial statements shall present fairly 
the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of an entity. Fair presentation requires 
the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance 
with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in 
the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements: 
(a)
The application of the recognition and measurement requirements in Australian 
Accounting Standards and the disclosures in this Standard, with additional disclosure 
when necessary, is presumed to result in financial statements that achieve a fair 
presentation of the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of Tier 2 
entities.
(b)
As explained in paragraph 13 of AASB 1053, this Standard does not apply to an entity 
with public accountability.
The additional disclosures referred to in (a) are necessary when compliance with the specific 
requirements in this Standard is insufficient to enable users to understand the effect of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance. 
Compliance with Australian Accounting Standards – Simplified Disclosures
10
An entity whose financial statements comply with the recognition and measurement requirements in 
Australian Accounting Standards, the presentation requirements in those Standards as modified by this 
Standard, and the disclosure requirements in this Standard shall make an explicit and unreserved statement of 
such compliance in the notes. Financial statements shall not be described as complying with Australian 
Accounting Standards – Simplified Disclosures unless they comply with all of these requirements. [Based on 
IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 3.3]

STANDARD
11
An entity shall disclose in the notes:
(a)
the statutory basis or other reporting framework, if any, under which the financial statements are 
prepared; and
(b)
whether, for the purposes of preparing the financial statements, it is a for-profit or not-for-profit 
entity.
12
Entities applying Australian Accounting Standards – Simplified Disclosures shall not depart from a 
requirement in an Australian Accounting Standard, including this Standard.
13
In the extremely rare circumstances when management concludes that compliance with a recognition and 
measurement requirement in an Australian Accounting Standard, or a presentation and disclosure requirement 
in this Standard, would be so misleading that it would conflict with the objective of financial statements set 
out in the Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting, but the relevant regulatory framework prohibits 
departure from the requirement, the entity shall, to the maximum extent possible, reduce the perceived 
misleading aspects of compliance by disclosing the following:
(a)
the title of the Australian Accounting Standard in question, the nature of the requirement and the 
reason why management has concluded that complying with that requirement is so misleading in 
the circumstances that it conflicts with the objective of financial statements set out in the 
Conceptual Framework for Financial Reporting; and
(b)
for each period presented, the adjustments to each item in the financial statements that management 
has concluded would be necessary to achieve a fair presentation.
[Based on IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 3.7]
AusCF13
Notwithstanding paragraph 13, in respect of AusCF entities, in the extremely rare circumstances 
when management concludes that compliance with a recognition and measurement requirement in 
an Australian Accounting Standard, or a presentation and disclosure requirement in this Standard, 
would be so misleading that it would conflict with the objective of financial statements set out in 
the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial Statements, but the relevant 
regulatory framework prohibits departure from the requirement, the entity shall, to the maximum 
extent possible, reduce the perceived misleading aspects of compliance by disclosing the following:
(a)
the title of the Australian Accounting Standard in question, the nature of the requirement 
and the reason why management has concluded that complying with that requirement is 
so misleading in the circumstances that it conflicts with the objective of financial 
statements set out in the Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of Financial 
Statements; and
(b)
for each period presented, the adjustments to each item in the financial statements that 
management has concluded would be necessary to achieve a fair presentation.
Going concern
14
When preparing financial statements, the management of an entity using Australian Accounting Standards – 
Simplified Disclosures shall make an assessment of the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern. An 
entity is a going concern unless management either intends to liquidate the entity or to cease operations, or 
has no realistic alternative but to do so. In assessing whether the going concern assumption is appropriate, 
management takes into account all available information about the future, which is at least, but is not limited 
to, twelve months from the reporting date. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 3.8]
15
When management is aware, in making its assessment, of material uncertainties related to events or conditions 
that cast significant doubt upon the entity’s ability to continue as a going concern, the entity shall disclose 
those uncertainties. When an entity does not prepare financial statements on a going concern basis, it shall 
disclose that fact, together with the basis on which it prepared the financial statements and the reason why the 
entity is not regarded as a going concern. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 3.9]
Frequency of reporting
16
An entity shall present a complete set of financial statements (including comparative information – see 
paragraph 20) at least annually. When the end of an entity’s reporting period changes and the annual financial 
statements are presented for a period longer or shorter than one year, the entity shall disclose the following:
(a)
that fact;
(b)
the reason for using a longer or shorter period; and
Authorised Version F2025C00209 registered 06/03/2025

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AASB 1060-compiled
8
STANDARD
(c)
the fact that comparative amounts presented in the financial statements (including the related notes) 
are not entirely comparable.
[IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 3.10]
Consistency of presentation
17
An entity shall retain the presentation and classification of items in the financial statements from one period 
to the next unless:
(a)
it is apparent, following a significant change in the nature of the entity’s operations or a review of 
its financial statements, that another presentation or classification would be more appropriate 
having regard to the criteria for the selection and application of accounting policies in AASB 108 
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors; or
(b)
Australian Accounting Standards – Simplified Disclosures require a change in presentation.
[IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 3.11]
18
When the presentation or classification of items in the financial statements is changed, an entity shall 
reclassify comparative amounts unless the reclassification is impracticable. When comparative amounts are 
reclassified, an entity shall disclose the following:
(a)
the nature of the reclassification;
(b)
the amount of each item or class of items that is reclassified; and
(c)
the reason for the reclassification.
[IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 3.12]
19
If it is impracticable to reclassify comparative amounts, an entity shall disclose why reclassification was not 
practicable. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 3.13]
Comparative information
20
Except when this Standard permits or requires otherwise, an entity shall disclose comparative information in 
respect of the previous comparable period for all amounts presented in the current period’s financial 
statements. An entity shall include comparative information for narrative and descriptive information when 
it is relevant to an understanding of the current period’s financial statements. [IFRS for SMEs Standard 
paragraph 3.14]
Materiality and aggregation
21
An entity shall present separately each material class of similar items. An entity shall present separately items 
of a dissimilar nature or function unless they are immaterial. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 3.15]
22
Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence 
decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those financial 
statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity. [Based on IFRS for SMEs 
Standard paragraph 3.16]
23
This Standard specifies information that is required to be included in the financial statements, which include 
the notes. An entity need not provide a specific disclosure if the information resulting from that disclosure is 
not material. This is the case even if this Standard contains a list of specific requirements or describes them 
as minimum requirements.
Offsetting
24
An entity shall not offset assets and liabilities or income and expenses, unless required or permitted by an 
Australian Accounting Standard.
Complete set of financial statements
25
A complete set of financial statements of an entity shall include all of the following:
(a)
a statement of financial position as at the reporting date;
Authorised Version F2025C00209 registered 06/03/2025

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AASB 1060-compiled
9
STANDARD
(b)
either:
(i)
a single statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income for the reporting 
period displaying all items of income and expense recognised during the period including 
those items recognised in determining profit or loss (which is a subtotal in the statement 
of comprehensive income) and items of other comprehensive income; or
(ii)
a separate statement of profit or loss and a separate statement of comprehensive income. 
If an entity chooses to present both a statement of profit or loss and a statement of 
comprehensive income, the statement of comprehensive income begins with profit or 
loss and then displays the items of other comprehensive income;
(c)
a statement of changes in equity for the reporting period;
(d)
a statement of cash flows for the reporting period; and
(e)
notes, comprising material accounting policy information and other explanatory information.
[Based on IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 3.17]
26
If the only changes to equity during the periods for which financial statements are presented arise from profit 
or loss, payment of dividends, corrections of prior period errors, and changes in accounting policy, the entity 
may present a single statement of income and retained earnings in place of the statement of comprehensive 
income and statement of changes in equity (see paragraph 62). [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 3.18]
27
If an entity has no items of other comprehensive income in any of the periods for which financial statements 
are presented, it may present only a statement of profit or loss or it may present a statement of comprehensive 
income in which the ‘bottom line’ is labelled ‘profit or loss’. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 3.19]
28
Because paragraph 20 requires comparative amounts in respect of the previous period for all amounts 
presented in the financial statements, a complete set of financial statements means that an entity shall present, 
as a minimum, two of each of the required financial statements and related notes. [IFRS for SMEs Standard 
paragraph 3.20]
29
In a complete set of financial statements, an entity shall present each financial statement with equal 
prominence. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 3.21]
30
An entity may use titles for the financial statements other than those used in this Standard as long as they are 
not misleading. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 3.22]
Identification of the financial statements
31
An entity shall clearly identify each of the financial statements and the notes and distinguish them from other 
information in the same document. In addition, an entity shall display the following information prominently 
and repeat it when necessary for an understanding of the information presented:
(a)
the name of the reporting entity and any change in its name since the end of the preceding reporting 
period;
(b)
whether the financial statements cover the individual entity or a group of entities;
(c)
the date of the end of the reporting period and the period covered by the financial statements;
(d)
the presentation currency, as defined in AASB 121 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange 
Rates; and
(e)
the level of rounding, if any, used in presenting amounts in the financial statements.
[IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 3.23]
32
An entity shall disclose the following, if not disclosed elsewhere in information published with the financial 
statements:
(a)
the domicile and legal form of the entity, its country of incorporation and the address of its 
registered office (or principal place of business, if different from the registered office); and
(b)
a description of the nature of the entity’s operations and its principal activities.
[IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 3.24]
Presentation of information not required by this Standard
33
This Standard does not address presentation of segment information (AASB 8 Operating Segments), earnings 
per share (AASB 133 Earnings per Share), or interim financial reports (AASB 134). An entity making such

disclosures shall apply the relevant Standards in preparing and presenting the information. [IFRS for SMEs 
Standard paragraph 3.25]
Statement of Financial Position3
Scope of this section
34
This section sets out the information that is to be presented in a statement of financial position and how to 
present it. The statement of financial position (sometimes called the balance sheet) presents an entity’s assets, 
liabilities and equity as of a specific date – the end of the reporting period. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 
4.1]
Information to be presented in the statement of financial position
35
As a minimum, the statement of financial position shall include line items that present the following amounts:
(a)
cash and cash equivalents;
(b)
trade and other receivables;
(c)
financial assets (excluding amounts shown under (a), (b), (i) and (j));
(d)
inventories;
(e)
property, plant and equipment;
(f)
investment property;
(g)
intangible assets;
(h)
biological assets;
(i)
investments in associates;
(j)
investments in joint ventures; 
(k)
trade and other payables;
(l)
financial liabilities (excluding amounts shown under (k) and (o));
(m)
liabilities and assets for current tax;
(n)
deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets (these shall always be classified as non-current);
(o)
provisions;
(p)
non-controlling interests, presented within equity separately from the equity attributable to the 
owners of the parent;
(q)
equity attributable to the owners of the parent;
(r)
the total of assets classified as held for sale and assets included in disposal groups classified as held 
for sale in accordance with AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations; and
(s)
liabilities included in disposal groups classified as held for sale in accordance with AASB 5.
[Based on IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 4.2]
36
An entity shall present additional line items, headings and subtotals in the statement of financial position 
when such presentation is relevant to an understanding of the entity’s financial position. [IFRS for SMEs 
Standard paragraph 4.3]
Current/non-current distinction
37
An entity shall present current and non-current assets, and current and non-current liabilities, as separate 
classifications in its statement of financial position in accordance with paragraphs 38–41, except when a 
presentation based on liquidity provides information that is reliable and more relevant. When that exception 
applies, all assets and liabilities shall be presented in order of approximate liquidity (ascending or 
descending). [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 4.4]

STANDARD
Current assets
38
An entity shall classify an asset as current when:
(a)
it expects to realise the asset, or intends to sell or consume it, in the entity’s normal operating cycle;
(b)
it holds the asset primarily for the purpose of trading;
(c)
it expects to realise the asset within twelve months after the reporting date; or
(d)
the asset is cash or a cash equivalent, unless it is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle 
a liability for at least twelve months after the reporting date.
[IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 4.5]
39
An entity shall classify all other assets as non-current. When the entity’s normal operating cycle is not clearly 
identifiable, its duration is assumed to be twelve months. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 4.6]
Current liabilities
40
An entity shall classify a liability as current when:
(a)
it expects to settle the liability in the entity’s normal operating cycle;
(b)
it holds the liability primarily for the purpose of trading;
(c)
the liability is due to be settled within twelve months after the reporting date; or
(d)
the entity does not have the right at the reporting date to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
twelve months after the reporting date.
[Based on IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 4.7]
41
An entity shall classify all other liabilities as non-current. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 4.8]
41A
Terms of a liability that could, at the option of the counterparty, result in its settlement by the transfer of the 
entity’s own equity instruments do not affect its classification as current or non-current if, applying 
AASB 132 Financial Instruments: Presentation, the entity classifies the option as an equity instrument, 
recognising it separately from the liability as an equity component of a compound financial instrument.
Sequencing of items and format of items in the statement of financial position
42
This Standard does not prescribe the sequence or format in which items are to be presented. Paragraph 35 
simply provides a list of items that are sufficiently different in nature or function to warrant separate 
presentation in the statement of financial position. In addition:
(a)
line items are included when the size, nature or function of an item or aggregation of similar items 
is such that separate presentation is relevant to an understanding of the entity’s financial position; 
and
(b)
the descriptions used and the sequencing of items or aggregation of similar items may be amended 
according to the nature of the entity and its transactions, to provide information that is relevant to 
an understanding of the entity’s financial position.
[IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 4.9]
43
The judgement on whether additional items are presented separately is based on an assessment of all of the 
following:
(a)
the amounts, nature and liquidity of assets;
(b)
the function of assets within the entity; and
(c)
the amounts, nature and timing of liabilities.
[IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 4.10]
Information to be presented either in the statement of financial position or in 
the notes
44
An entity shall disclose, either in the statement of financial position or in the notes, further subclassifications 
of the line items presented, classified in a manner appropriate to the entity’s operation. This includes for 
example:
(a)
property, plant and equipment in classifications appropriate to the entity;

(b)
trade and other receivables showing separately amounts due from related parties, amounts due from 
other parties and contract assets from contracts with customers;
(c)
inventories, showing separately amounts of inventories:
(i)
held for sale in the ordinary course of business;
(ii)
in the process of production for such sale; and
(iii)
in the form of materials or supplies to be consumed in the production process or in the 
rendering of services.
(d)
trade and other payables, showing separately amounts payable to trade suppliers, amounts payable 
to related parties, contract liabilities from contracts with customers and accruals;
(e)
provisions for employee benefits and other provisions; and
(f)
classes of equity, such as paid-in capital, share premium, retained earnings and items of income 
and expense that, as required by Australian Accounting Standards, are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and presented separately in equity.

Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income4
Scope of this section
48
This section requires an entity to present its total comprehensive income for a period—ie its financial 
performance for the period—in one or two financial statements. It sets out the information that is to be 
presented in those statements or in the notes and how to present it. [Based on IFRS for SMEs Standard 
paragraph 5.1]
Presentation of total comprehensive income
49
An entity shall present its total comprehensive income for a period either:
(a)
in a single statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, in which case the statement 
of comprehensive income presents all items of income and expense recognised in the period; or
(b)
in two statements—a statement of profit or loss and a statement of comprehensive income—in 
which case the statement of profit or loss presents all items of income and expense recognised in 
the period except those that are recognised in total comprehensive income outside of profit or loss 
as permitted or required by other Australian Accounting Standards.
[IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 5.2]
50
A change from the single-statement approach to the two-statement approach, or vice versa, is a change in 
accounting policy to which AASB 108 applies. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 5.3]
Single-statement approach
51
Under the single-statement approach, the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income shall 
include all items of income and expense recognised in a period unless other Australian Accounting Standards 
require otherwise. Australian Accounting Standards provide different treatment for the following 
circumstances:
(a)
the effects of corrections of errors and changes in accounting policies are presented as retrospective 
adjustments of prior periods instead of as part of profit or loss in the period in which they arise (see 
AASB 108); and
(b)
items of other comprehensive income are recognised as part of total comprehensive income, outside 
of profit or loss, when they arise.
[Based on IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 5.4]
52
As a minimum, an entity shall include, in the statement(s) presenting profit or loss and other comprehensive 
income, line items that present the following amounts for the period:
(a)
revenue;
(b)
finance costs;
(c)
share of the profit or loss of investments in associates and joint ventures accounted for using the 
equity method (see AASB 128 Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures);
(d)
tax expense;
(e)
a single amount for the total of:
(i)
discontinued operations (see AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations); and
(ii)
the post-tax gain or loss attributable to an impairment, or reversal of an impairment, of 
the assets in the discontinued operation (see AASB 5), both at the time and subsequent 
to being classified as a discontinued operation and to the disposal of the net assets 
constituting the discontinued operation;
(f)
profit or loss (if an entity has no items of other comprehensive income, this line need not be 
presented);

(g)
each item of other comprehensive income (see paragraph 51(b)) classified by nature (excluding 
amounts in (h)). Such items shall be grouped into those that, in accordance with other Australian 
Accounting Standards:
(i)
will not be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss; and
(ii)
will be reclassified subsequently to profit or loss when specific conditions are met;
(h)
share of the other comprehensive income of associates and joint ventures accounted for by the 
equity method; and
(i)
total comprehensive income (if an entity has no items of other comprehensive income, it may use 
another term for this line such as profit or loss).
[Based on IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 5.5]
53
An entity shall disclose separately the following items in the statement(s) presenting profit or loss and other 
comprehensive income as allocations for the period:
(a)
profit or loss for the period attributable to:
(i)
non-controlling interests; and
(ii)
owners of the parent; and
(b)
total comprehensive income for the period attributable to:
(i)
non-controlling interests; and
(ii)
owners of the parent.
[IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 5.6]
Two-statement approach
54
Under the two-statement approach, the statement of profit or loss shall display, as a minimum, line items that 
present the amounts in paragraph 52(a)–52(f) for the period, with profit or loss as the last line. The statement 
of comprehensive income shall begin with profit or loss as its first line and shall display, as a minimum, line 
items that present the amounts in paragraph 52(g)–52(i) and paragraph 53 for the period. [IFRS for SMEs 
Standard paragraph 5.7]
Requirements applicable to both approaches
55
Under AASB 108, the effects of corrections of errors and changes in accounting policies are presented as 
retrospective adjustments of prior periods instead of as part of profit or loss in the period in which they arise. 
[IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 5.8]
56
An entity shall present additional line items, headings and subtotals in the statement(s) presenting profit or 
loss and other comprehensive income (and in the statement of profit or loss, if presented), when such 
presentation is relevant to an understanding of the entity’s financial performance. [IFRS for SMEs Standard 
paragraph 5.9]
57
An entity shall not present or describe any items of income and expense as ‘extraordinary items’ in the 
statement(s) presenting profit or loss and other comprehensive income (or in the statement of profit or loss, 
if presented) or in the notes. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 5.10]
Analysis of expenses
58
An entity shall present in the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income or in the notes an 
analysis of expenses using a classification based on either the nature of expenses or the function of expenses 
within the entity, whichever provides information that is reliable and more relevant.
Analysis by nature of expense
(a)
Under this method of classification, expenses are aggregated in the statement(s) of profit and loss 
and other comprehensive income according to their nature (for example, depreciation, purchases of 
materials, transport costs, employee benefits and advertising costs) and are not reallocated among 
various functions within the entity.

STANDARD
Analysis by function of expense
(b)
Under this method of classification, expenses are aggregated according to their function as part of 
cost of sales or, for example, the costs of distribution or administrative activities. At a minimum, 
an entity discloses its cost of sales under this method separately from other expenses.
[Based on IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 5.11]
Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement of Income and 
Retained Earnings5
Scope of this section
59
This section sets out requirements for presenting the changes in an entity’s equity for a period, either in a 
statement of changes in equity or, if specified conditions are met and an entity chooses, in a statement of 
income and retained earnings. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 6.1]
Statement of changes in equity
Purpose
60
The statement of changes in equity presents an entity’s profit or loss for a reporting period, other 
comprehensive income for the period, the effects of changes in accounting policies and corrections of errors 
recognised in the period and the amounts of investments by, and dividends and other distributions to, owners 
in their capacity as owners during the period. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 6.2]
Information to be presented in the statement of changes in equity
61
The statement of changes in equity includes the following information:
(a)
total comprehensive income for the period, showing separately the total amounts attributable to 
owners of the parent and to non-controlling interests;
(b)
for each component of equity, the effects of retrospective application or retrospective restatement 
recognised in accordance with AASB 108; and
(c)
for each component of equity, a reconciliation between the carrying amount at the beginning and 
the end of the period, separately disclosing changes resulting from:
(i)
profit or loss;
(ii)
other comprehensive income; and
(iii)
the amounts of investments by, and dividends and other distributions to, owners in their 
capacity as owners, showing separately issues of shares, treasury share transactions, 
dividends and other distributions to owners and changes in ownership interests in 
subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control.
[IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 6.3]
Statement of income and retained earnings
Purpose
62
The statement of income and retained earnings presents an entity’s profit or loss and changes in retained 
earnings for a reporting period. Paragraph 26 permits an entity to present a statement of income and retained 
earnings in place of a statement of comprehensive income and a statement of changes in equity if the only 
changes to its equity during the periods for which financial statements are presented arise from profit or loss, 
payment of dividends, corrections of prior period errors, and changes in accounting policy. [IFRS for SMEs 
Standard paragraph 6.4]

Statement of Cash Flows6
Scope of this section
64
This section sets out the information that is to be presented in a statement of cash flows and how to present 
it. The statement of cash flows provides information about the changes in cash and cash equivalents of an 
entity for a reporting period, showing separately changes from operating activities, investing activities and 
financing activities. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 7.1]
Cash equivalents
65
Cash equivalents are short-term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to known amounts of 
cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. They are held to meet short-term cash 
commitments instead of for investment or other purposes. Consequently, an investment normally qualifies as 
a cash equivalent only when it has a short maturity of, say, three months or less from the date of acquisition. 
Bank overdrafts are normally considered financing activities similar to borrowings. However, if they are 
repayable on demand and form an integral part of an entity’s cash management, bank overdrafts are a 
component of cash and cash equivalents. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 7.2]
Information to be presented in the statement of cash flows
66
An entity shall present a statement of cash flows that presents cash flows for a reporting period classified by 
operating activities, investing activities and financing activities. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 7.3]
Operating activities
67
Operating activities are the principal revenue-producing activities of the entity. Consequently, cash flows 
from operating activities generally result from the transactions and other events and conditions that enter into 
the determination of profit or loss. Examples of cash flows from operating activities are:
(a)
cash receipts from the sale of goods and the rendering of services;
(b)
cash receipts from royalties, fees, commissions and other revenue;
(c)
cash payments to suppliers for goods and services;
(d)
cash payments to and on behalf of employees;
(e)
cash payments or refunds of income tax, unless they can be specifically identified with financing 
and investing activities; and
(f)
cash receipts and payments from investments, loans and other contracts held for dealing or trading 
purposes, which are similar to inventory acquired specifically for resale.
Some transactions, such as the sale of an item of plant by a manufacturing entity, may give rise to a gain or 
loss that is included in profit or loss. However, the cash flows relating to such transactions are cash flows 
from investing activities. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 7.4]

STANDARD
Investing activities
68
Investing activities are the acquisition and disposal of long-term assets and other investments not included in 
cash equivalents. Examples of cash flows arising from investing activities are:
(a)
cash payments to acquire property, plant and equipment (including self-constructed property, plant 
and equipment), intangible assets and other long-term assets;
(b)
cash receipts from sales of property, plant and equipment, intangibles and other long-term assets;
(c)
cash payments to acquire equity or debt instruments of other entities and interests in joint ventures 
(other than payments for those instruments classified as cash equivalents or held for dealing or 
trading);
(d)
cash receipts from sales of equity or debt instruments of other entities and interests in joint ventures 
(other than receipts for those instruments classified as cash equivalents or held for dealing or 
trading);
(e)
cash advances and loans made to other parties;
(f)
cash receipts from the repayment of advances and loans made to other parties;
(g)
cash payments for futures contracts, forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts, except 
when the contracts are held for dealing or trading, or the payments are classified as financing 
activities; and
(h)
cash receipts from futures contracts, forward contracts, option contracts and swap contracts, except 
when the contracts are held for dealing or trading, or the receipts are classified as financing 
activities.
When a contract is accounted for as a hedge (see AASB 9 Financial Instruments and AASB 139 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement), an entity shall classify the cash flows of the contract in the same 
manner as the cash flows of the item being hedged. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 7.5]
Financing activities
69
Financing activities are activities that result in changes in the size and composition of the contributed equity 
and borrowings of an entity. Examples of cash flows arising from financing activities are:
(a)
cash proceeds from issuing shares or other equity instruments;
(b)
cash payments to owners to acquire or redeem the entity’s shares;
(c)
cash proceeds from issuing debentures, loans, notes, bonds, mortgages and other short-term or long-
term borrowings;
(d)
cash repayments of amounts borrowed; and
(e)
cash payments by a lessee for the reduction of the outstanding liability relating to a lease.
[IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 7.6]
Reporting cash flows from operating activities
70
An entity shall present cash flows from operating activities using either:
(a)
the indirect method, whereby profit or loss is adjusted for the effects of non-cash transactions, any 
deferrals or accruals of past or future operating cash receipts or payments and items of income or 
expense associated with investing or financing cash flows; or
(b)
the direct method, whereby major classes of gross cash receipts and gross cash payments are 
disclosed.
[IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 7.7]
Indirect method
71
Under the indirect method, the net cash flow from operating activities is determined by adjusting profit or 
loss for the effects of:
(a)
changes during the period in inventories and operating receivables and payables;
Authorised Version F2025C00209 registered 06/03/2025

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AASB 1060-compiled

STANDARD
(b)
non-cash items such as depreciation, provisions, deferred tax, accrued income (expenses) not yet 
received (paid) in cash, unrealised foreign currency gains and losses, undistributed profits of 
associates and non-controlling interests; and
(c)
all other items for which the cash effects relate to investing or financing.
[IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 7.8]
72
Alternatively, the net cash flow from operating activities may be presented under the indirect method by 
showing the revenues and expenses disclosed in the statement of comprehensive income and the changes 
during the period in inventories and operating receivables and payables.
Direct method
73
Under the direct method, net cash flow from operating activities is presented by disclosing information about 
major classes of gross cash receipts and gross cash payments. Such information may be obtained either:
(a)
from the accounting records of the entity; or
(b)
by adjusting sales, cost of sales and other items in the statement of comprehensive income (or the 
statement of profit or loss, if presented) for:
(i)
changes during the period in inventories and operating receivables and payables;
(ii)
other non-cash items; and
(iii)
other items for which the cash effects are investing or financing cash flows.
[IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 7.9]
Reporting cash flows from investing and financing activities
74
An entity shall present separately major classes of gross cash receipts and gross cash payments arising from 
investing and financing activities. The aggregate cash flows arising from acquisitions and from disposals of 
subsidiaries or other business units shall be presented separately and classified as investing activities. [IFRS 
for SMEs Standard paragraph 7.10]
Reporting cash flows on a net basis
75
Cash flows arising from the following operating, investing or financing activities may be reported on a net 
basis:
(a)
cash receipts and payments on behalf of customers when the cash flows reflect the activities of the 
customer rather than those of the entity; and
(b)
cash receipts and payments for items in which the turnover is quick, the amounts are large, and the 
maturities are short.
76
Examples of cash receipts and payments referred to in paragraph 75(a) are:
(a)
the acceptance and repayment of demand deposits of a bank;
(b)
funds held for customers by an investment entity; and
(c)
rents collected on behalf of, and paid over to, the owners of properties.
77
Examples of cash receipts and payments referred to in paragraph 75(b) are advances made for, and the 
repayment of:
(a)
principal amounts relating to credit card customers;
(b)
the purchase and sale of investments; and
(c)
other short-term borrowings, for example, those which have a maturity period of three months or 
less.
78
Cash flows arising from each of the following activities of a financial institution may be reported on a net 
basis:
(a)
cash receipts and payments for the acceptance and repayment of deposits with a fixed maturity 
date;
(b)
the placement of deposits with and withdrawal of deposits from other financial institutions; and
(c)
cash advances and loans made to customers and the repayment of those advances and loans.

STANDARD
Foreign currency cash flows
79
An entity shall record cash flows arising from transactions in a foreign currency in the entity’s functional 
currency by applying to the foreign currency amount the exchange rate between the functional currency and 
the foreign currency at the date of the cash flow. Paragraph 40 in AASB 121 explains when an exchange rate 
that approximates the actual rate can be used. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 7.11]
80
The entity shall translate cash flows of a foreign subsidiary at the exchange rates between the entity’s 
functional currency and the foreign currency at the dates of the cash flows. [IFRS for SMEs Standard 
paragraph 7.12]
81
Unrealised gains and losses arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates are not cash flows. 
However, to reconcile cash and cash equivalents at the beginning and the end of the period, the effect of 
exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents held or due in a foreign currency must be presented in 
the statement of cash flows. Consequently, the entity shall remeasure cash and cash equivalents held during 
the reporting period (such as amounts of foreign currency held and foreign currency bank accounts) at period-
end exchange rates. The entity shall present the resulting unrealised gain or loss separately from cash flows 
from operating, investing and financing activities. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 7.13]
Interest and dividends
82
An entity shall present separately cash flows from interest and dividends received and paid. The entity shall 
classify cash flows consistently from period to period as operating, investing or financing activities. [IFRS 
for SMEs Standard paragraph 7.14]
83
An entity may classify interest paid and interest and dividends received as operating cash flows because they 
are included in profit or loss. Alternatively, the entity may classify interest paid and interest and dividends 
received as financing cash flows and investing cash flows respectively, because they are costs of obtaining 
financial resources or returns on investments. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 7.15]
84
An entity may classify dividends paid as a financing cash flow because they are a cost of obtaining financial 
resources. Alternatively, the entity may classify dividends paid as a component of cash flows from operating 
activities because they are paid out of operating cash flows. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 7.16]
Income tax
85
An entity shall present separately cash flows arising from income tax and shall classify them as cash flows 
from operating activities unless they can be specifically identified with financing and investing activities. 
When tax cash flows are allocated over more than one class of activity, the entity shall disclose the total 
amount of taxes paid. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 7.17]
Non-cash transactions
86
An entity shall exclude from the statement of cash flows investing and financing transactions that do not 
require the use of cash or cash equivalents. An entity shall disclose such transactions elsewhere in the financial 
statements in a way that provides all the relevant information about those investing and financing activities. 
[IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 7.18]
87
Many investing and financing activities do not have a direct impact on current cash flows even though they 
affect the capital and asset structure of an entity. The exclusion of non-cash transactions from the statement 
of cash flows is consistent with the objective of a statement of cash flows because these items do not involve 
cash flows in the current period. Examples of non-cash transactions are:
(a)
the acquisition of assets either by assuming directly related liabilities or by means of a lease;
(b)
the acquisition of an entity by means of an equity issue; and
(c)
the conversion of debt to equity.
[IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 7.19]
Components of cash and cash equivalents
88
An entity shall present the components of cash and cash equivalents and shall present a reconciliation of the 
amounts presented in the statement of cash flows to the equivalent items presented in the statement of 
financial position. However, an entity is not required to present this reconciliation if the amount of cash and

cash equivalents presented in the statement of cash flows is identical to the amount similarly described in the 
statement of financial position. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 7.20]
Other disclosures
89
An entity shall disclose, together with a commentary by management, the amount of significant cash and cash 
equivalent balances held by the entity that are not available for use by the entity. Cash and cash equivalents 
held by an entity may not be available for use by the entity because of, among other reasons, foreign exchange 
controls or legal restrictions. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 7.21]
Notes to the Financial Statements7
Scope of this section
90
This section sets out the principles underlying information that is to be presented in the notes to the financial 
statements and how to present it. Notes contain information in addition to that presented in the statement of 
financial position, the statement of profit or loss  and other comprehensive income (if presented), the statement 
of profit or loss and the statement of comprehensive income (if presented), the combined statement of income 
and retained earnings (if presented), the statement of changes in equity (if presented) and the statement of 
cash flows. Notes provide narrative descriptions or disaggregations of items presented in those statements 
and information about items that do not qualify for recognition in those statements. In addition to the 
requirements of this section, nearly every other section of this Standard requires disclosures that are normally 
presented in the notes. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 8.1]
Structure of the notes
91
The notes shall:
(a)
present information about the basis of preparation of the financial statements and the specific 
accounting policies used, in accordance with paragraphs 95–97;
(b)
disclose the information required by this Standard that is not presented elsewhere in the financial 
statements; and
(c)
provide information that is not presented elsewhere in the financial statements but is relevant to an 
understanding of any of them.
[IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 8.2]
92
An entity shall, as far as practicable, present the notes in a systematic manner. An entity shall cross-reference 
each item in the financial statements to any related information in the notes. [IFRS for SMEs Standard 
paragraph 8.3]
93
Examples of systematic ordering or grouping of the notes include:
(a)
giving prominence to the areas of its activities that the entity considers to be most relevant to an 
understanding of its financial performance and financial position, such as grouping together 
information about particular operating activities;
(b)
grouping together information about items measured similarly such as assets measured at fair value; 
or
(c)

Supplier finance arrangements
119A
Supplier finance arrangements are characterised by one or more finance providers offering to pay amounts an 
entity owes its suppliers and the entity agreeing to pay according to the terms and conditions of the 
arrangements at the same date as, or a date later than, suppliers are paid. These arrangements provide the 
entity with extended payment terms, or the entity’s suppliers with early payment terms, compared to the 
related invoice payment due date. Supplier finance arrangements are often referred to as supply chain finance, 
payables finance or reverse factoring arrangements. Arrangements that are solely credit enhancements for the 
entity (for example, financial guarantees including letters of credit used as guarantees) or instruments used 
by the entity to settle directly with a supplier the amounts owed (for example, credit cards) are not supplier 
finance arrangements.
119B
An entity shall disclose in aggregate for its supplier finance arrangements:
(a)
the terms and conditions of the arrangements (for example, extended payment terms and security 
or guarantees provided). However, an entity shall disclose separately the terms and conditions of 
arrangements that have dissimilar terms and conditions;

and
(iii)
the range of payment due dates (for example, 30–40 days after the invoice date) for both 
the financial liabilities disclosed under (i) and comparable trade payables that are not part 
of a supplier finance arrangement. Comparable trade payables are, for example, trade 
payables of the entity within the same line of business or jurisdiction as the financial 
liabilities disclosed under (i). If ranges of payment due dates are wide, an entity shall 
disclose explanatory information about those ranges or disclose additional ranges (for 
example, stratified ranges); and
(c)
the type and effect of non-cash changes in the carrying amounts of the financial liabilities disclosed 
under (b)(i). Examples of non-cash changes include the effect of business combinations, exchange

Related Party Disclosures31
Scope of this section
189
This section requires an entity to include in its financial statements the disclosures necessary to draw attention 
to the possibility that its financial position and profit or loss have been affected by the existence of related 
parties and by transactions and outstanding balances with such parties. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 
33.1]
190
In considering each possible related party relationship, an entity shall assess the substance of the relationship 
and not merely the legal form. [IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 33.3]
191
In the context of this Standard, the following are not necessarily related parties:
(a)
two entities simply because they have a director or other member of key management personnel in 
common;
(b)
two venturers simply because they share joint control over a joint venture;
(c)
any of the following simply by virtue of their normal dealings with an entity (even though they 
may affect the freedom of action of an entity or participate in its decision-making process):
(i)
providers of finance;
(ii)
trade unions;
(iii)
public utilities; or
(iv)
government departments and agencies; and
(d)
a customer, supplier, franchisor, distributor or general agent with whom an entity transacts a 
significant volume of business, merely by virtue of the resulting economic dependence.
[IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 33.4]
Disclosure of parent-subsidiary relationships
192
Relationships between a parent and its subsidiaries shall be disclosed irrespective of whether there have been 
related party transactions. An entity shall disclose the name of its parent and, if different, the ultimate 
controlling party. If neither the entity’s parent nor the ultimate controlling party produces financial statements 
available for public use, the name of the next most senior parent that does so (if any) shall also be disclosed. 
[IFRS for SMEs Standard paragraph 33.5]
Disclosure of key management personnel compensation
193
Key management personnel are those persons having authority and responsibility for planning, directing and 
controlling the activities of the entity, directly or indirectly, including any director (whether executive or 
otherwise) of that entity. Compensation includes all employee benefits (as defined in AASB 119) including 
those in the form of share-based payment (see AASB 2 Share-based Payment). Employee benefits include all 
forms of consideration paid, payable or provided by the entity, or on behalf of the entity (for example, by its 
parent or by a shareholder), in exchange for services rendered to the entity. It also includes such consideration 
paid on behalf of a parent of the entity in respect of goods or services provided to the entity. [IFRS for SMEs 
Standard paragraph 33.6]
194
An entity shall disclose key management personnel compensation in total. [IFRS for SMEs Standard 
paragraph 33.7]
195
If an entity obtains key management personnel services from another entity (the ‘management entity’), the 
entity is not required to apply the requirements in paragraph 194 to the compensation paid or payable by the 
management entity to the management entity’s employees or directors.

(a)
a state (a national, regional or local government) that has control, joint control or significant 
influence over the reporting entity; and
(b)
another entity that is a related party because the same state has control, joint control or significant 
influence over both the reporting entity and the other entity.
However, the entity must still disclose a parent-subsidiary relationship as required by paragraph 192. [IFRS 
for SMEs Standard paragraph 33.11]

Income of not-for-profit entities43
226
The objective of the disclosure requirements is for an entity to disclose sufficient information to enable users 
of financial statements to understand the effects of volunteer services and other transactions where an entity 
acquires an asset for consideration that is significantly less than fair value principally to enable the entity to 
further its objectives on the financial position, financial performance and cash flows of the entity. Paragraphs

227
An entity shall consider the level of detail necessary to satisfy the disclosure objective and how much 
emphasis to place on each of the various requirements. An entity shall aggregate or disaggregate disclosures 
so that useful information is not obscured by either the inclusion of a large amount of insignificant detail or 
the aggregation of items that have substantially different characteristics. 
228
An entity need not disclose information in accordance with paragraphs 226–241 if it has provided the 
information in accordance with other sections in this Standard.

during the period, disaggregated into categories that reflect how the nature and amount of income (and the 
resultant cash flows) are affected by economic factors. 
231
To meet the objective in paragraph 226, an entity shall consider disclosing information about assets and 
liabilities recognised at the reporting date in accordance with AASB 1058 Income of Not-for-Profit Entities, 
including the amounts of: 
(a)

Other information that may be appropriate for an entity to disclose includes, for each class of taxation income 
that the entity cannot measure reliably during the period in which the taxable event occurs (see paragraphs 
B28–B31 of AASB 1058): 
(a)
information about the nature of the tax; 
(b)

Transfers to enable an entity to acquire or construct a recognisable non-
financial asset to be controlled by the entity 
233
An entity shall disclose the opening and closing balances of financial assets arising from transfers to enable 
an entity to acquire or construct recognisable non-financial assets to be controlled by the entity and the 
associated liabilities arising from such transfers, if not otherwise separately presented or disclosed. An entity 
shall also disclose income recognised in the reporting period arising from the reduction of an associated 
liability. 
234
An entity shall disclose information about its obligations under such transfers, including a description of when 
the entity typically satisfies its obligations (for example, as the asset is constructed, upon completion of 
construction or when the asset is acquired).
235
An entity shall disclose the judgements, and changes in the judgements, made in applying AASB 1058 that 
significantly affect the determination of the amount and timing of income arising from transfers to enable an 
entity to acquire or construct a recognisable non-financial asset to be controlled by the entity. In particular, 
an entity shall explain the judgements, and changes in the judgements, made in determining the timing of 
satisfaction of obligations (see paragraphs 236 and 237). 
236
For obligations that an entity satisfies over time, an entity shall disclose the methods used to recognise income 
(for example, a description of the output methods or input methods used and how those methods are applied).
237

evaluating when it has satisfied its obligations. 
Compliance with parliamentary appropriations and other related authorities for 
expenditure
238

or all of their spending authority for the period from a parliamentary appropriation. The amounts disclosed in 
accordance with paragraphs 239–241 include any amounts appropriated in respect of which the entity 
recognises revenue or other income in accordance with another Australian Accounting Standard.

STANDARD
239
An entity shall disclose: 
(a)
a summary of the recurrent, capital or other major categories of amounts authorised for expenditure 
(including parliamentary appropriations), disclosing separately: 
(i)
the original amounts appropriated; and 
(ii)
the total of any supplementary amounts appropriated and amounts authorised other than 
by way of appropriation (eg by the Treasurer, other Minister or other legislative 
authority); 
(b)
the expenditures in respect of each of the items disclosed in (a) above; and 
(c)
the reasons for any material variances between the amounts appropriated or otherwise authorised 
and the resulting associated expenditures, and any financial consequences for the entity of 
unauthorised expenditure. 
240
For the purposes of resource allocation decisions, including assessments of accountability, AASB 1058 
requires that users of financial statements of government departments and other public sector entities that 
obtain part or all of their spending authority for the period from a parliamentary appropriation be provided 
with information about the amounts appropriated or otherwise authorised for the entity’s use, and whether the 
entity’s expenditures were as authorised. This information may be based on acquittal processes applied by an 
entity. When spending limits imposed by parliamentary appropriation or other authorisation have not been 
complied with, information regarding the amount of, and reasons for, the non-compliance is relevant for 
assessing the performance of management, the likely consequences of non-compliance, and the ability of the 
entity to continue to provide services at a similar or different level in the future. 
241
Broad summaries of the major categories of appropriations and associated expenditures, rather than detailed 
reporting of appropriations for each activity or output, is sufficient for most users of such an entity’s financial 
statements. Determining the level of detail and the structure of the summarised information is a matter of 
judgement. To develop effective disclosures, entities also subject to AASB 1055 might consider the variance 
disclosure requirements in that Standard at the same time.
Service concession arrangements: grantors that are public sector 
entities44
242
The objective of the disclosure requirements is for a public sector grantor to disclose sufficient information 
to enable users of financial statements to understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of assets, 
liabilities, revenue and cash flows arising from service concession arrangements. To achieve this, an entity 
shall consider disclosing qualitative and quantitative information about its service concession arrangements, 
including the following:
(a)
a description of the arrangements;
(b)
significant terms of the arrangements that may affect the amount, timing and uncertainty of future 
cash flows (eg the period of the arrangement, re-pricing dates and the basis upon which re-pricing 
or renegotiation is determined);
(c)
the nature and extent (eg quantity, time period, or amount, as appropriate) of:
(i)
rights to receive specified services from the operator;
(ii)
the carrying amount of service concession assets as at the end of the reporting period, 
including separate disclosure for existing assets of the grantor reclassified as service 
concession assets during the reporting period;
(iii)
rights to receive specified assets at the end of an arrangement;
(iv)
renewal and termination options;
(v)
other rights and obligations (eg major overhaul of service concession assets); and
(vi)
obligations to provide the operator with access to service concession assets or other 
revenue-generating assets; and
(d)
changes in arrangements occurring during the reporting period.
243
The disclosures provided by an entity in accordance with paragraph 242 are provided individually for each 
material service concession arrangement or in aggregate for service concession arrangements involving 
services of a similar nature, in addition to disclosures required by the sections covering Property, Plant and

APPENDIX A
Appendix A
Defined terms
This appendix is an integral part of the Standard.
The following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings specified. Except to the extent specifically addressed 
in this Standard, the definitions in other Australian Accounting Standards also apply.
Presentation of the financial statements
Accounting policies are defined in paragraph 5 of AASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting 
Estimates and Errors, and the term is used in this Standard with the same meaning.
General purpose financial statements (referred to as ‘financial statements’) are those intended to meet the 
needs of users who are not in a position to require an entity to prepare reports tailored to their particular 
information needs. 
Impracticable Applying a requirement is impracticable when the entity cannot apply it after making 
every reasonable effort to do so. 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) are Standards and Interpretations issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).  They comprise: 
(a)
International Financial Reporting Standards; 
(b)
International Accounting Standards; 
(c)
IFRIC Interpretations; and
(d)
SIC Interpretations.45 
Material:
Information is material if omitting, misstating or obscuring it could reasonably be expected to influence 
decisions that the primary users of general purpose financial statements make on the basis of those 
financial statements, which provide financial information about a specific reporting entity.
Materiality depends on the nature or magnitude of information, or both. An entity assesses whether 
information, either individually or in combination with other information, is material in the context of its 
financial statements taken as a whole.
Information is obscured if it is communicated in a way that would have a similar effect for primary users of 
financial statements to omitting or misstating that information. The following are examples of circumstances 
that may result in material information being obscured:
(a)
information regarding a material item, transaction or other event is disclosed in the financial 
statements but the language used is vague or unclear;
(b)
information regarding a material item, transaction or other event is scattered throughout the 
financial statements;
(c)
dissimilar items, transactions or other events are inappropriately aggregated;
(d)
similar items, transactions or other events are inappropriately disaggregated; and
(e)
the understandability of the financial statements is reduced as a result of material information being 
hidden by immaterial information to the extent that a primary user is unable to determine what 
information is material.
Assessing whether information could reasonably be expected to influence decisions made by the primary 
users of a specific reporting entity’s general purpose financial statements requires an entity to consider the 
characteristics of those users while also considering the entity’s own circumstances.
Many existing and potential investors, lenders and other creditors cannot require reporting entities to provide 
information directly to them and must rely on general purpose financial statements for much of the financial 
information they need. Consequently, they are the primary users to whom general purpose financial 
statements are directed. Financial statements are prepared for users who have a reasonable knowledge of 
business and economic activities and who review and analyse the information diligently. At times, even well-
informed and diligent users may need to seek the aid of an adviser to understand information about complex 
economic phenomena.
45 Definition of IFRSs amended after the name changes introduced by the revised Constitution of the IFRS Foundation in 2010.

APPENDIX A
Notes contain information in addition to that presented in the statement of financial position, 
statement(s) of profit or loss and other comprehensive income, separate income statement (if 
presented), statement of changes in equity and statement of cash flows.  Notes provide narrative 
descriptions or disaggregations of items presented in those statements and information about items that 
do not qualify for recognition in those statements. 
Other comprehensive income comprises items of income and expense (including reclassification 
adjustments) that are not recognised in profit or loss as required or permitted by other Australian 
Accounting Standards. 
The components of other comprehensive income include: 
(a)
changes in revaluation surplus (see AASB 116 Property, Plant and Equipment and AASB 138 
Intangible Assets); 
(b)
remeasurements of defined benefit plans (see AASB 119 Employee Benefits); 
(c)
gains and losses arising from translating the financial statements of a foreign operation (see 
AASB 121 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates); 
(d)
gains and losses from investments in equity instruments designated at fair value through other 
comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 5.7.5 of AASB 9 Financial Instruments;
(da)
gains and losses on financial assets measured at fair value through other comprehensive income in 
accordance with paragraph 4.1.2A of AASB 9;
(e)
the effective portion of gains and losses on hedging instruments in a cash flow hedge and the gains 
and losses on hedging instruments that hedge investments in equity instruments measured at fair 
value through other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 5.7.5 of AASB 9 (see 
Chapter 6 of AASB 9);
(f)
for particular liabilities designated as at fair value through profit or loss, the amount of the change 
in fair value that is attributable to changes in the liability’s credit risk (see paragraph 5.7.7 of 
AASB 9);
(g)
changes in the value of the time value of options when separating the intrinsic value and time value 
of an option contract and designating as the hedging instrument only the changes in the intrinsic 
value (see Chapter 6 of AASB 9); 
(h)
changes in the value of the forward elements of forward contracts when separating the forward 
element and spot element of a forward contract and designating as the hedging instrument only the 
changes in the spot element, and changes in the value of the foreign currency basis spread of a 
financial instrument when excluding it from the designation of that financial instrument as the 
hedging instrument (see Chapter 6 of AASB 9);
(i)
insurance finance income and expenses from contracts issued within the scope of AASB 17 
Insurance Contracts excluded from profit or loss when total insurance finance income or expenses 
is disaggregated to include in profit or loss an amount determined by a systematic allocation 
applying paragraph 88(b) of AASB 17, or by an amount that eliminates accounting mismatches 
with the finance income or expenses arising on the underlying items, applying paragraph 89(b) of 
AASB 17; and
(j)
finance income and expenses from reinsurance contracts held excluded from profit or loss when 
total reinsurance finance income or expenses is disaggregated to include in profit or loss an amount 
determined by a systematic allocation applying paragraph 88(b) of AASB 17.
Owners are holders of instruments classified as equity. 
Profit or loss is the total of income less expenses, excluding the components of other comprehensive 
income. 
Reclassification adjustments are amounts reclassified to profit or loss in the current period that were 
recognised in other comprehensive income in the current or previous periods. 
Total comprehensive income is the change in equity during a period resulting from transactions and 
other events, other than those changes resulting from transactions with owners in their capacity as 
owners. 
Total comprehensive income comprises all components of ‘profit or loss’ and of ‘other comprehensive 
income’.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
Basis for Conclusions
This Basis for Conclusions accompanies, but is not part of, AASB 1060.
Introduction
BC1
This Basis for Conclusions summarises the Australian Accounting Standards Board’s considerations in 
reaching the conclusions in AASB 1060. It sets out the reasons why the Board developed the Standard, the 
approach taken to developing the Standard and key decisions made. In making decisions, individual Board 
members gave greater weight to some factors than to others. 
The need for a new disclosure Standard for Tier 2 entities
BC2
This Standard has been developed in conjunction with AASB 2020-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting 
Standards – Removal of Special Purpose Financial Statements for Certain For-Profit Private Sector Entities 
to:
(a)
provide Tier 2 reporting requirements for those for-profit entities that will be prohibited from 
preparing special purpose financial statements (SPFS) when AASB 2020-2 becomes operative, that 
appropriately balance the needs of users with the costs of moving from SPFS to Tier 2; 
(b)
reduce the reporting burden of for-profit and not-for-profit (NFP) entities using the current Tier 2 
reporting requirements for preparing General Purpose Financial Statements (GPFS) as a result of 
the AASB’s post-implementation review of the current Reduced Disclosure Requirements (RDR) 
framework; and
(c)
maximise the use of relevant International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) based materials 
by more closely reflecting the IFRS for SMEs disclosures in this Standard and support the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) with its project to develop a reduced disclosure 
IFRS standard that combines full IFRS recognition and measurement (R&M) requirements with 
IFRS for SMEs disclosures1.
BC3
Entities that are required to prepare financial statements in accordance with Australian Accounting Standards 
(AAS) have a choice of two disclosure frameworks2:
(a)
Tier 1 reporting requirements which apply to the GPFS of for-profit private sector entities that have 
public accountability and are required by legislation to prepare financial statements that comply 
with either Australian Accounting Standards or accounting standards and the Australian 
Government and State, Territory and Local Governments; and 
(b)
Tier 2 reporting requirements which apply to the GPFS of for-profit private sector entities that do 
not have public accountability, not-for-profit private sector entities and public sector entities, 
whether for-profit or not-for-profit, other than the Australian Government and State, Territory and 
Local Governments. 
BC4
Before the adoption of AASB 2020-2 entities that had self-assessed to be a non-reporting entity, could also 
elect to prepare SPFS. However, in March 2020 the Board decided to remove this ability based on the 
feedback received on the March 2018 Consultation Paper ITC 39 Applying the IASB’s Revised Conceptual 
Framework and Solving the Reporting Entity and Special Purpose Financial Statement Problems and the 
subsequent ED 297 Removal of Special Purpose Financial Statements for Certain For-Profit Private Sector 
Entities. 
BC5
AASB 2020-2 removes the ability to prepare SPFS for the following for-profit entities:
(a)
for-profit private sector entities that are required by legislation to comply with either Australian 
Accounting Standards or accounting standards;
(b)
other for-profit private sector entities that are required only by their constituting document or 
another document to comply with Australian Accounting Standards, provided that the relevant 
document was created or amended on or after 1 July 2021; and
1
In January 2020, the IASB moved its Disclosure Initiative – Subsidiaries that are SMEs project to the standard-setting programme. The 
objective of the project is to develop a reduced disclosure IFRS Standard that would apply on a voluntary basis to subsidiaries that do not 
have public accountability.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
(c)
other for-profit entities that elect to prepare GPFS and apply the revised Conceptual Framework 
for Financial Reporting (Conceptual Framework) and the consequential amendments to other 
pronouncements set out in Accounting Standards AASB 2019-1 Amendments to Australian 
Accounting Standards – References to the Conceptual Framework and AASB 2020-2 Amendments 
to Australian Accounting Standards – Removal of Special Purpose Financial Statements for 
Certain For-Profit Sector Entities.
BC6
To help reduce the cost burden for for-profit entities that will be affected by the removal of SPFS, and noting 
the comments received on ITC 39, the Board agreed to make further reductions to the disclosures that apply 
to Tier 2 entities compared to the GPFS Tier 2 RDR framework. 
BC7
The Board also noted the strong preference expressed by respondents to ITC 39 for a framework that includes 
full R&M requirements in AAS on the grounds that it would enhance the comparability, consistency and 
transparency of the financial statements. Feedback from targeted outreach emphasised that users agreed the 
usefulness of information within financial statements for decision making is adversely affected where entities 
have not consistently applied R&M requirements. Further discussion of the Board’s consideration on this 
matter is available in AASB 2020-2 paragraphs BC108−BC114. 
BC8
While some respondents had called for more than one Tier 2 GPFS framework for for-profit entities, the 
Board noted that given the small number of for-profit entities required to publicly lodge financial statements 
with ASIC, which will be even less following the increase of the reporting thresholds for large proprietary 
companies (April 2019), the development and maintenance of more than two GPFS disclosure frameworks 
was not warranted. The Board further emphasised that entities without a statutory requirement to comply with 
AAS, such as those below the now doubled large proprietary thresholds, would be able to continue to tailor 
their financial statements to the needs of their specific users and therefore additional Tiers were not required. 
Further discussion of the Board’s consideration on this matter is available in AASB 2020-2 paragraphs 
BC99−BC107.
BC9
However, separate targeted consultations will be undertaken in relation to the implementation of the IASB’s 
revised Conceptual Framework by not-for-profit (NFP) private and public sector entities which may result in 
more than two tiers for those sectors, as the characteristics of those sectors are quite different. For these 
entities, this Standard is therefore an interim measure until more progress is made through further consultation 
and outreach.
BC10
After having considered the various options outlined below and the feedback received on ED 295 General 
Purpose Financial Statements – Simplified Disclosures for For-Profit and Not-for-Profit Tier 2 Entities, the 
Board is of the view that this Standard addresses stakeholders’ concerns and provides an appropriate balance 
between user needs and preparer costs. 
Options considered: why using the IFRS for SMEs Standard as the basis 
for the new Tier 2 Standard?
BC11
In developing AASB 1060, the Board considered the following options:
(a)
retain the current Tier 2 disclosure requirements (RDR framework); 
(b)
adopt the alternative proposed in ITC 39 (SDR framework – see paragraph BC13);
(c)
revisit the proposals in ED 277 Reduced Disclosures Requirements for Tier 2 Entities; or
(d)
develop a new disclosure Standard based on the IFRS for SMEs Standard. 
RDR and SDR frameworks – feedback from ITC 39
BC12
In ITC 39, the Board proposed to replace the current RDR framework with a revised disclosure framework 
and proposed two alternatives for Tier 2 (See Specific Matter for Comment 12 of ITC 39). Alternative 1 was 
the existing Tier 2 RDR under AASB 1053 Application of Tiers of Australian Accounting Standards which 
requires compliance with the full R&M requirements of AAS (as amended for NFP specific issues) and with 
minimum disclosures specified in each Standard. 
BC13
The second proposed alternative, the Specified Disclosure Requirement (SDR), was a revised disclosure 
framework. It required full R&M requirements of AAS (as amended for NFP specific issues) and included 
the disclosure of those Standards that are currently mandatory for entities required to prepare financial 
statements in accordance with Chapter 2M of the Corporations Act 2001 (Cwth), being AASB 101 
Presentation of Financial Statements, AASB 107 Statement of Cash Flows, AASB 108 Accounting Policies, 
Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, AASB 1048 Interpretation of Standards and AASB 1054 
Australian Additional Disclosures, and disclosures required by AASB 15 Revenue from Contracts with

Assets.
BC14
After issuing ITC 39, the Board held targeted outreach with key stakeholders, including State, Territory and 
National regulators, audit offices, accounting firms, the Australian Securities Exchange (ASX), the Australian 
Taxation Office (ATO), the Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC), credit rating agencies 
and professional bodies. The ITC 39 proposals were also presented at various forums, workshops, roundtables 
and discussion groups.
BC15
The Board received feedback on its proposals in ITC 39 through 33 formal comment letters from professional 
service firms, regulators, professional bodies, academics, preparers, users of financial statements and other 
respondents. Furthermore, feedback was sought via targeted user and preparer surveys in quarter 3 of 2018, 
which received a total of 37 user and 49 preparer responses3. The surveys were focussed on the specific 
matters for comment in ITC 39, and were used to get a better understanding of which of the Tier 2 GPFS 
frameworks proposed in ITC 39 users preferred (and why), as well as what transitional relief would be helpful 
to preparers. 
BC16
The feedback on the proposed SDR framework was that the SDR had too many disclosures in some ways but 
fell short in many other ways. For example, the feedback received from roundtables, surveys and submissions 
on ITC 39 was that whilst the disclosures in SDR are important, requiring full disclosure of those nine 
Standards (as explained in paragraph BC13) was too much. Most participants further suggested that SDR 
might not be appropriate for all industry sectors and is missing some critical disclosures to help predict the 
viability of an entity such as liquidity, contingent liabilities, subsequent events and commitment disclosures. 
BC17
At the same time, respondents noted that refining the principles used in determining the level of disclosures 
required for Tier 2 entities to achieve an appropriate balance between the benefits of financial information to 
users and the costs to preparers of providing that information is crucial. The feedback from the roundtables, 
surveys and submissions on ITC 39 indicated that RDR has too many disclosure requirements. 
Revisiting the proposals in ED 277
BC18
The RDR disclosure requirements in Australia and New Zealand are essentially the same and are based on an 
approach developed by the Board in 2010. That approach draws on the disclosure requirements in the IFRS 
for SMEs Standard when Tier 2 R&M requirements are the same as those under the IFRS for SMEs Standard; 
and applies the ‘user needs’ and ‘cost-benefit’ principles applied by the IASB in developing its IFRS for 
SMEs Standard when full R&M requirements are not the same as those available under the IFRS for SMEs 
Standard. A top-down approach is used which starts with the full IFRS disclosures and then identifies those 
that can be removed. The Board noted that there could be a tendency to retain disclosures in circumstances 
where a direct comparison is not possible.
BC19
A post implementation review of the RDR framework was carried out by the Board which identified that the 
RDR disclosure requirements had not delivered the expected outcome and that take up of the RDR framework 
by entities was consequently low4. In response to the findings of the post implementation review, the Board 
issued ED 277 in January 2017 as a joint project with the New Zealand Accounting Standards Board 
(NZASB). 
BC20
ED 277 proposed adopting an RDR decision-making framework, together with accompanying operational 
guidance. The framework was based on Key Disclosure Areas (KDAs) which were meant to result in 
information that meets user needs. Judgement was required when applying this framework, and the 
overarching principles of user needs and cost-benefit were considered when determining the disclosures that 
Tier 2 entities should make.
BC21
The approach taken in the proposed Tier 2 framework in ED 277 was to include an Australian Appendix in 
each AAS that identifies the disclosures that Tier 2 entities are required to provide, thereby addressing 
concerns by those that find the shading used to identify disclosures that can be omitted confusing. However, 
while ED 277 was based on clear disclosure principles, the cost-benefit analysis was difficult to apply in the 
3
See AASB Staff Paper Enhancing the revised Conceptual Framework and replacing Special Purpose Financial Statements – For-profit 
User and Preparer Survey Results.
4
As per paragraph BC14 of ED 277, the level of adoption among other types of companies, including large proprietary companies was 
very low – with the likely reason being that the general level of disclosure under Tier 2 was still viewed as burdensome. A research paper 
(Potter, B., Tanewski, G., and Wright, S., 2016, Financial Reporting by Private Companies in Australia: Current Practice and 
Opportunities for Research, paper presented at the AASB Research Forum, November 24 2016, Sydney) on the financial reporting 
practices by a sample of large proprietary companies in Australia lodging annual financial statements with ASIC identified that:
(i) 
less than 10 percent of the total sample use Tier 2 disclosures; and
(ii) 
of those large proprietary companies sampled that prepare GPFS, around 20 percent use Tier 2 disclosures.
A subsequent analysis of financial reports of for-profit non-disclosing entities lodging financial statements with ASIC in 2018 confirmed 
that 71 percent of these entities were still lodging SPFS with ASIC, 13 percent lodged Tier 2 GPFS and 16 percent Tier 1.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
context of disclosures and the top-down approach resulted in too many disclosures being retained, as removal 
was difficult to justify with the KDAs. 
BC22
Feedback from Australian stakeholders confirmed that ED 277 still resulted in too many disclosures. While 
the Board had intended to conduct further outreach and consultation on the proposals in ED 277, any further 
work was put on hold following the issue of the revised Conceptual Framework by the IASB in March 2018 
and the decision by the Board to reform the Australian Financial Reporting Framework and propose removing 
the ability for entities to prepare SPFS when required to comply with AAS by legislation or otherwise.
Issue of ED 295 – New disclosure Standard based on the 
disclosures in IFRS for SMEs Standard
BC23
In weighing up the shortfalls of RDR, the other proposed Tier 2 options and the disclosure principles applied 
by the IASB while developing the IFRS for SMEs Standard, the Board decided in February 2019 to develop 
a new Tier 2 Standard based on the disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs Standard which would be available for 
GPFS that are publicly lodged or are required to comply with AAS, but do not relate to entities that are 
publicly accountable.
BC24
Using the IFRS for SMEs Standard as the base maximises the use of relevant IFRS-based materials. The Board 
further noted that the IASB had added a research project on Subsidiaries that are SMEs to their agenda in 
March 2019, which was moved to the standard-setting programme in January 2020. Consistent with the policy 
of adopting Standards issued by the IASB for application by Australian entities, AASB 1060 may ultimately 
be replaced with the Standard developed by the IASB. This would not only remove the need for the Board to 
maintain a separate Tier 2 Standard, but also provide comparability and consistency for subsidiary reporting 
globally. However, this is a longer-term project and the Board needs to have a revised disclosure framework 
in place in time for the removal of SPFS from 1 July 2021. While the Board could therefore not wait for the 
IASB to complete their project, the Board will monitor the progress of the IASB’s project closely.
BC25
The disclosures that are relevant to Tier 2 entities are set out in a separate Standard, being AASB 1060, which 
was exposed for public comment in August 2019 as ED 295, together with ED 297. The comment period for 
both EDs ended on 30 November 2019. 
BC26
Extensive outreach was conducted on the proposals, including roundtables in Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane, 
Perth and Adelaide, attended by 127 stakeholders, a webinar with 162 participants, as well as separate 
consultations with the AASB’s User Advisory Committee, credit analysts and private equity investors.
BC27
The Board received 25 formal submissions on ED 295 from stakeholders representing professional services 
firms, regulators, professional bodies, academics, preparers, public sector audit offices, software providers 
and others. 
BC28
The following section details the matter considered by the Board in developing the proposals and this 
Standard, including the Board’s decisions on how to address stakeholders’ feedback as part of the exposure 
process. 
Costs vs benefits
BC29
The Board identified the following benefits arising from the adoption of the new Tier 2 Standard over the 
other options considered:
(a)
The IASB has developed the disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs Standard with for-profit private 
sector entities that are not publicly accountable entities in mind and considers that they are adequate 
to meet the needs of the relevant users5. 
(b)
A comparison of the new disclosures to the disclosures that would be required under the SDR and 
RDR has confirmed that adoption of the new Tier 2 Standard addresses stakeholders concerns by 
resulting in a level of disclosures that lies in between the current RDR and the proposed SDR 
requirements.
(c)
This option is based on a bottom-up approach in developing disclosures and avoids needing to 
identify specific full IFRS disclosures that need to be retained and those that can be excluded. It is 
a more rigorous and targeted way of reducing disclosures to an appropriate level (based on previous 
5
The IASB was guided by the broad principles set out in paragraph BC41, but also relied on the recommendations of a working group 
which undertook a comprehensive review of the disclosure proposals in the exposure draft, and the comments on those proposals in 
response to the exposure draft. In addition, the IASB received feedback from representatives of a number of German banks that lend 
extensively to small private entities and provided the IASB with a comprehensive report on disclosure needs from a bank lender’s 
perspective. See paragraphs BC44-BC47 and BC156-158 of the IFRS for SMEs Standard – Part B.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
experiences with the RDR approach, as it involves needing to justify additional disclosures rather 
than the removal of disclosures from full IFRS). 
(d)
This option introduces more flexibility as it allows drafting disclosures to suit the circumstances 
and not be restricted by existing full IFRS disclosures. 
(e)
Setting out the disclosures in a separate Standard will make it easier for stakeholders, as it avoids 
having to identify applicable disclosures via shading in between the full disclosures. The Board 
noted that this will also improve readability where parts of sentences were shaded in the RDR (ie 
excluded).
BC30
However, the Board noted that adopting this Standard will result in a divergence from the New Zealand RDR 
Framework. The AASB’s For-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework sets out that differences between 
accounting Standards issued in Australia and New Zealand for for-profit entities should be minimised 
wherever possible to reduce the costs for entities operating trans-Tasman. This divergence could cause 
inconvenience for entities operating trans-Tasman. Notwithstanding this, the Board noted that the R&M 
requirements for entities applying the Tier 2 reporting frameworks in Australia and New Zealand would 
remain consistent and given the current situation of many Australian entities not complying with full R&M 
requirements, the overall outcome is likely to be more consistency with NZ requirements than currently. The 
Board further noted that the NZ XRB has asked its stakeholders about the importance of harmonisation with 
Australia in their Targeted Review of the Accounting Standards Framework in July 2019 and that the NZASB 
will consider the feedback in future discussions on whether and how to respond to the developments in 
Australia and internationally. 
BC31
The Board also noted that the simplified Tier 2 disclosures are contained in a separate Standard which might 
not be welcomed by preparers who prefer seeing the disclosure requirements together with the R&M 
requirements in each Standard. However, only four respondents to ED 295 did not like having a separate 
disclosure standard. Feedback at the roundtables and webinars was overwhelmingly positive.  
BC32
Finally, for entities that were previously preparing SPFS, the adoption of AASB 2020-2 means a step-up in 
their disclosures. The disclosures will also likely exceed what would have been required under the SDR 
proposals outlined in paragraph BC13. However, there will be some disclosure relief, as SPFS currently are 
required to comply with all the disclosures in the mandatory standards (AASB 101, AASB 107, AASB 108, 
AASB 1048 and AASB 1054) which go beyond what is required under AASB 1060. Furthermore, the 
doubling of the reporting thresholds for large proprietary companies in April 2019 has already reduced the 
number of entities that are required to prepare and lodge financial statements with ASIC by approximately 
2,300 companies, and the Board has further reduced the burden for affected entities by providing transitional 
relief for entities that are adopting AASB 2020-2 and AASB 1060 early, ie for financial years beginning 
before 1 July 2021. Further discussion of the Board’s consideration on this matter is available in 
AASB 2020-2 paragraphs BC122−BC153.
BC33
After considering both the advantages and disadvantages noted above, the Board was of the view that the 
simplified disclosures strike the right balance between user needs and cost to preparers and appropriately 
address the concerns raised by respondents to ITC 39. In particular, the Board noted the strong support for a 
consistent reporting framework which requires compliance with full R&M requirements in AAS but revisits 
the current disclosures that are required for Tier 2 entities under the RDR framework. The disclosures in 
AASB 1060 will not only be beneficial for entities that are already reporting under Tier 2 but also those 
entities that will have to step up from SPFS to Tier 2 GPFS when the  removal of SPFS for certain for-profit 
private sector entities that are required to prepare financial statements that comply with AAS or accounting 
standards through AASB 2020-2 becomes applicable. 
Methodology and principles applied
BC34
In accordance with AASB 1053, Tier 2 requirements comprise the R&M requirements of Tier 1 but 
substantially reduced disclosure requirements. AASB 1053 sets out the eligibility criteria that entities must 
meet to report in accordance with the Tier 2 framework. This framework does not change those criteria.
BC35
The Board agreed to develop the new disclosures via a bottom-up approach, starting with the existing 
disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs Standard. This avoids having to identify specific full AAS disclosures that 
need to be retained and those that can be excluded. This approach also avoids the tendency to retain 
disclosures in circumstances where a direct comparison is not possible. To distinguish the new disclosure 
framework from the previous RDR framework, it will be referred to as the ‘Simplified Disclosures’ 
framework.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
BC36
While the Board has decided not to adopt the IFRS for SMEs Standard as an alternative for Tier 2 reporting6, 
the IASB’s assessment of user needs and cost-benefit considerations in relation to the disclosures for this 
group of entities will be similarly relevant to Australian for-profit private sector entities without public 
accountability. The Board therefore considers the IFRS for SMEs based disclosures an appropriate starting 
point for developing a disclosure Standard for this group of entities. 
BC37
The Simplified Disclosures framework is based on the premise that the disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs 
Standard should be retained where the R&M requirements and options are the same or similar in the IFRS for 
SMEs Standard and full IFRS. Disclosures relating to R&M options or treatments in the IFRS for SMEs 
Standard that are not available in full IFRS will be removed. Disclosures have only been added in comparison 
with the IFRS for SMEs Standard base where the R&M principles were significantly different or certain topics 
are not addressed under the IFRS for SMEs Standard. 
BC38
In considering the IFRS for SMEs Standard, the Board noted that the nature and degree of the differences 
between the disclosures in full IFRS Standards and the disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs Standard is 
determined on the basis of users’ needs and cost-benefit analyses7. The Board noted that the overall increase 
in disclosures for entities transitioning from SPFS (eg related party and financial instrument disclosures) 
offsets the loss of some disclosures as a result of not having to fully comply with AASB 101, AASB 107, 
AASB 108, AASB 1048 and AASB 1054. In some instances, based on user feedback, public policy interest 
(eg audit fees and tax reconciliation – see paragraphs BC75 and BC79–80) or to reflect Australian specific 
issues (eg imputation credits – see paragraphs BC83-BC84), the Board has retained additional disclosures 
above IFRS for SMEs. 
BC39
The disclosure requirements in the IFRS for SMEs Standard are therefore substantially reduced when 
compared with the disclosure requirements in full IFRS Standards. The IASB identified the following four 
principles as being used for the reductions: 
(a)
some disclosures are not included because they relate to topics covered in IFRS Standards that are 
omitted from the IFRS for SMEs Standard (as per paragraph BC88 of IFRS for SMEs Standard 2015 
– Part B);
(b)
some disclosures are not included because they relate to R&M principles in full IFRSs that have 
been replaced by simplifications in the IFRS for SMEs Standard (as per paragraphs BC98–BC136 
of the IFRS for SMEs Standard 2015 – Part B);
(c)
some disclosures are not included because they relate to options in full IFRS Standards that are not 
included in the IFRS for SMEs Standard (as per paragraphs BC84–BC86 of the IFRS for SMEs 
Standard 2015 – Part B); and
(d)
some disclosures are not included on the basis of users’ needs or cost-benefit considerations (as per 
paragraphs BC44–BC47, BC157 and BC158 of the IFRS for SMEs Standard 2015 – Part B). 
BC40
In addition to these principles, the Board further decided that disclosures should be reduced from the IFRS 
for SMEs Standard where the disclosure requirements have been removed from full IFRS after the IFRS for 
SMEs Standard was finalised and as a result exceed what is currently required under the full IFRS (as per 
paragraphs BC43, BC66–BC67 and BC71 of this Standard).
BC41
In determining what disclosures to add, the following broad principles have been applied by the Board, which 
are consistent with those applied by the IASB in developing the disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs Standard8:
(a)
users of the financial statements of for-profit entities that are not publicly accountable entities are 
particularly interested in information about short-term cash flows and about obligations, 
commitments or contingencies, whether or not recognised as liabilities. Thus disclosures in full 
IFRS Standards that provide this sort of information are necessary;
(b)
users of the financial statements of for-profit entities that are not publicly accountable entities are 
particularly interested in information about liquidity and solvency. Thus disclosures in full IFRS 
Standards that provide this sort of information are necessary;
(c)
information on measurement uncertainties is important;
(d)
information about an entity’s accounting policy choices is important;
6
In considering the feedback received on ITC 39, the AASB noted in February 2019 that while a minority of respondents had asked the 
Board to consider the IFRS for SMEs Standard as an option or alternative for Tier 2 GPFS, these respondents did not provide any new 
arguments as to whether the IFRS for SMEs Standard would be preferable to full R&M. The AASB further noted that the IFRS for SMEs 
Standard includes requirements for consolidated financial statements, deferred tax accounting, financial instruments accounting and 
related party disclosures that are not substantively different to full IFRS R&M requirements. For these reasons, the AASB decided not to 
propose a Tier 2 GPFS framework with differential R&M requirements as an option or alternative for Tier 2 GPFS for the for-profit 
sector. Further discussion of the Board’s consideration on this matter is available in AASB 2020-2 paragraphs BC99−BC107.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
(e)
disaggregations of amounts presented in the financial statements of for-profit entities that are not 
publicly accountable entities are important for an understanding of those statements; and
(f)
some disclosures in full IFRS Standards are more relevant to investment decisions in public capital 
markets than to the transactions and other events and conditions encountered by typical for-profit 
entities that are not publicly accountable entities.
BC42
In addition, to these principles the Board agreed to add disclosures where they address matters of public policy 
(eg audit fees and tax reconciliation – see paragraphs BC75 and BC79–BC80) or reflect Australian specific 
issues (eg imputation credits – see paragraphs BC83-BC84).
BC43
Consistent with the IASB’s intentions in relation to the Subsidiaries that are SMEs project, tailoring of the 
IFRS for SMEs disclosure requirements has further been restricted to the absolute minimum. As identified in 
paragraph BC70, this resulted in the retention of termination benefit disclosures which are not required under 
full AAS. However, consistent with the principle in paragraph BC40, where the IASB has removed 
disclosures from full IFRS after the IFRS for SMEs Standard was finalised, these reductions were carried over 
to AASB 1060. This has affected in particular the leasing disclosures, see paragraphs BC66–BC67 and 
resulted in the removal of a number of employee benefits disclosures. 
BC44
To identify R&M differences, the Board has referred to:
(a)
the AASB staff paper Comparison of Standards for Smaller Entities prepared and published in 
April 2018;
(b)
full IFRS vs IFRS for SMEs Standard comparisons included in the IFRS for SMEs Standard 
modules published by the IASB; and
(c)
individual analyses of Standards, where a topic is covered by neither of these two sources. 
BC45
Judgement was exercised when applying the framework and the overarching principles of user needs and 
cost-benefit were considered when determining the disclosures that are relevant for Tier 2 entities. Significant 
judgements made in this process are explained in paragraphs BC54−BC93. 
BC46
The disclosures that are relevant to Tier 2 entities are set out in this Standard (ie are not shaded in the body 
or the appendix of each AAS). They are considered by the Board to be appropriate for GPFSs that are publicly 
lodged or are required to comply with AAS, but do not relate to entities that are publicly accountable.
BC47
As a general rule, the presentation requirements of full AAS have been retained, and the Board noted that it 
did not intend to make any changes to the presentation requirements or accounting treatments available under 
AAS. 
BC48
This applies in particular to the presentation requirements in AASB 101 and AASB 107 even though these 
Standards have been replaced in their entirety with AASB 1060 paragraphs 8 to 97. The only exception made 
relates to the option of not presenting a separate statement of changes in equity as noted in paragraph BC62.
BC49
ED 295 further proposed to replace the presentation requirements of AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for 
Sale and Discontinued Operations with those included in the IFRS for SMEs Standard. However, after 
considering the feedback received on ED 295, the Board decided to amend the proposals to align the 
presentation requirements in AASB 1060 with those in AASB 5. This will ensure consistency in the 
presentation of discontinued operations between Tier 1 and Tier 2 entities and is consistent with the overall 
intention to retain the presentation requirements from full AAS and only adopt the IFRS for SMEs disclosures. 
BC50
The Board noted that any future changes made to AAS will be assessed using the above principles, to 
determine whether and how the changes would require amendments to AASB 1060. Where necessary, 
amendments to AASB 1060 will be made in time to ensure they are effective at the same time as the 
amendments to the full AAS. This will ensure AASB 1060 will continue to be appropriately aligned with the 
requirements of full AAS. 
Scope and application to not-for-profit and public sector entities
BC51
While the disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs Standard are developed specifically for for-profit private sector 
entities, the Board agreed that AASB 1060 should also be made applicable to not-for-profit private sector 
entities and public sector entities, other than the Australian Government and State, Territory and Local 
Governments. Making AASB 1060 applicable to all Tier 2 entities, whether for-profit or NFP, will result in 
an immediate reduction in disclosures compared to the current RDR framework, and NFP private sector 
entities will be able to benefit from this reduction in disclosures while waiting for legislative action on the 
ACNC legislative review recommendations and for a revised NFP Financial Reporting Framework to be

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
developed9. Similarly, public sector entities will also benefit while consideration is being given to improving 
public sector financial reporting10. The Tier 2 disclosure framework may still be relevant to NFP entities as 
one of the tiers of reporting for that sector even after a revised NFP Financial Reporting Framework is 
developed. 
BC52
While respondents to ED 295 had suggested deferring the mandatory date of AASB 1060 for NFP entities 
possibly until the NFP private and public sector financial reporting frameworks have been finalised, the Board 
decided against different application dates to avoid the confusion for users that would come from having two 
Tier 2 reporting frameworks in operation at the same time. 
BC53
In determining whether disclosures would need to be added to address any R&M differences that are specific 
to NFP private sector and public sector entities, the Board has applied paragraph 28 of the AASB’s Not-for-
Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework and the principles listed in paragraphs BC41 and BC42 above. 
While those principles have been developed with a specific focus on the users of the financial statements of 
private sector entities, the Board considers that they are also relevant to the users of the financial statements 
of NFP entities. However, the Board also acknowledged that certain transactions or items in the financial 
statements are unique to NFP entities and may require additional information, as set out in the AASB’s Not-
for-Profit Entity Standard Setting Framework. A limited number of disclosures have been added to 
AASB 1060 for that reason. Further details about the decisions made in relation to specific disclosures are set 
out in paragraphs BC91–BC93. 
Significant decisions made by the Board in developing the disclosures
Replacing entire Standards with AASB 1060
BC54
In considering the ease of application for Tier 2 entities, the Board decided to replace any Standards that deal 
exclusively with presentation and disclosure requirements in their entirety with the corresponding 
requirements in AASB 1060. New paragraphs 20A and 20B are added to AASB 1057 Application of 
Australian Accounting Standards to note that entities applying this Standard do not need to comply with 
AASB 7 Financial Instruments:Disclosures, AASB 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities, AASB 101, 
AASB 107 and AASB 124. These Standards will be replaced with the following sections from the IFRS for 
SMEs Standard: 
(a)
Financial Statement Presentation (AASB 101): paragraphs 8 – 33
(b)
Statement of Financial Position (AASB 101): paragraphs 34 – 47
(c)
Statement of Profit or Loss and Other Comprehensive Income (AASB 101): paragraphs 48 – 58
(d)
Statement of Changes in Equity and Statement of Income and Retained Earnings (AASB 101): 
paragraphs 59 – 63
(e)
Statement of Cash Flows (AASB 107): paragraphs 64 – 89
(f)
Notes to the Financial Statements (AASB 101): paragraphs 90 – 103
(g)
Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements (AASB 12): paragraphs 104 – 105
(h)
Basic Financial Instruments (AASB 7): paragraphs 111 – 119
(i)
Other Financial Instruments Issues (AASB 7): paragraphs 120 – 122
(j)
Investments in Associates (AASB 12): paragraphs 125 – 128
(k)
Investments in Joint Ventures (AASB 12): paragraphs 129 – 131
(l)
Related Party Disclosures (AASB 124): paragraphs 189 – 203
BC55
The Board noted that by replacing the five Standards listed in paragraph BC54, this also removes some of the 
guidance included in these Standards which is not included in the IFRS for SMEs Standard. However, for the 
sake of maintaining simplicity of the disclosure requirements, the Board considered this to be preferable to 
considering on a case-by-case basis which guidance should be included and which could be omitted. As noted 
in paragraph BC47, the Board does not intend the removal of the guidance to result in any differences in the 
presentation requirements to full AAS. However, in response to stakeholder feedback, the Board added 
paragraph 2 which specifically permits entities to refer to other Standards for guidance on requirements in 
this Standard. The Board also added the definitions from the replaced Standards in Appendix A.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
BC56
To prevent possible differences in presentation requirements to full AAS, the Board further decided to add 
the following requirements from AASB 101, AASB 107 and AASB 124 to AASB 1060 which deal with:
(a)
the prohibition for Australian entities that apply AASB 1060 to depart from a requirement in an 
Australian Accounting Standard (paragraph 12 in this Standard and paragraph Aus19.1 in 
AASB 101);
(b)
the specific prohibition to offset assets and liabilities or income and expenses, unless required or 
permitted by an Australian Accounting Standard (paragraph 24 in this standard and paragraph 32 
in AASB 101);
(c)
the option to present the net cash flow from operating activities under the indirect method by 
showing the revenues and expenses disclosed in the statement of comprehensive income and the 
changes during the period in inventories and operating receivables and payables (paragraph 72 in 
this standard and paragraph 20 in AASB 107); 
(d)
options to report certain cash flows on a net basis (paragraphs 75 to 78 in this Standard and 
paragraphs 22−24 in AASB 107);
(e)
the exemption from the disclosure of key management personnel compensation where the entity 
obtains key management personnel services from another entity (paragraphs 195 and 196 in this 
standard and paragraphs 17A and 18A in AASB 124).  
BC57
The prohibition to depart from a requirement in an Australian Accounting Standard reflects Australian 
specific circumstances which are also relevant to Tier 2 entities and hence needs to be included. Paragraphs 
3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 of the IFRS for SMEs Standard have been deleted, as they are not relevant to entities applying 
this Standard. 
BC58
The offsetting prohibition in paragraph BC56(b) is included in Section 2 Concepts and Pervasive Principles 
of the IFRS for SMEs Standard (paragraph 2.52). As this section has been otherwise excluded from this 
Standard on the basis that it does not include any disclosures, the prohibition had to be separately added to 
this Standard. 
BC59
Permitting the options in the presentation of the cash flow statement from AASB 107 ensures that there are 
no differences in presentation to full AAS and avoids any possible issues, for example for the consolidation 
of subsidiaries that report under Tier 2 by parent entities that report under Tier 1 (full AAS).
BC60
Retaining the exemption from disclosing key management personnel compensation in paragraph BC56(e) for 
entities that obtain key management personnel services from another entity avoids having potentially more 
onerous disclosure requirements than for Tier 1 entities. While arguably the exemption in paragraph 17A of 
AASB 124 (paragraph 195 in this Standard) only provides relief from disclosing the breakdown of key 
management personnel compensation that is otherwise required to be disclosed by AASB 124 paragraph 17, 
the Board noted that the fees paid to a management entity that must be disclosed under paragraph 18A of 
AASB 124 (paragraph 196 in this Standard) may also cover other services, and that the fees many not 
specifically identify the amount relating to key management personnel services. 
BC61
To avoid any potential R&M differences, the Board further decided to replace the definition of materiality in 
the IFRS for SMEs Standard with the recently updated definition of material from AASB 101 and added 
paragraph 23 which clarifies the application of materiality (based on paragraph 31 in AASB 101). The Board 
also replaced the guidance on the presentation of information in the notes (structure of notes, paragraph 93 in 
this standard and paragraph 8.4 in the IFRS for SMEs Standard) with the revised guidance from 
paragraphs 114 and 116 of AASB 101 that was introduced via amendments to AASB 101 in 2015 and added 
additional guidance to paragraph 40 confirming that the terms of a liability that could, at the option of the 
counterparty, result in its settlement by the issue of equity instruments do not affect its classification (from 
paragraph 69(d) of AASB 101). This will further ensure that there are no presentation differences to full AAS. 
BC62
Consistent with the basic approach of minimising differences to the disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs 
Standard, the Board decided to retain paragraph 3.18 of the IFRS for SMEs Standard which includes an option 
of not presenting a statement of changes in equity if the only changes to equity during the periods for which 
financial statements are presented arise from profit or loss, payment of dividends, corrections of prior period 
errors, and changes in accounting policy (paragraph 26 in this Standard).
BC63
In relation to the replacement of AASB 12, the Board noted that the investment entity exemption from 
consolidation creates a R&M difference to the IFRS for SMEs Standard. However, based on the principles 
listed in paragraph BC41, the Board did not consider that additional disclosures would be warranted in relation 
to this exemption. The Board noted that the IASB discussed the investment entity exception in the context of 
the 2020 Request for Information Comprehensive Review of the IFRS for SMEs Standard and concluded that 
few entities eligible to apply the IFRS for SMEs Standard would be investment entities. The Board also 
expects the exemption to have limited practical impact, since the majority of investment entities will be 
publicly accountable and therefore not able to apply this Standard.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
BC64
In responding to stakeholders’ concerns that an investment entity preparing separate financial statements 
could not comply with paragraph 105 of this Standard because the paragraph requires the entity to identify 
the consolidated financial statements or other primary financial statements to which the separate financial 
statements relate, the Board noted that separate financial statements are defined in AASB 127 Separate 
Financial Statements as financial statements that are presented in addition to consolidated financial statements 
or to financial statements that apply equity-accounting to investments in associates or joint ventures 
(consistent with the definition of separate financial statements in the IFRS for SMEs Standard). Therefore, the 
financial statements prepared by investment entities would not be separate financial statements under that 
definition and as a result paragraph 105 would not apply.
Judgements made in adding, removing or adapting the 
disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs Standard
BC65
The Board has exercised a number of significant judgements while adding, removing and amending 
disclosures from the certain sections of the IFRS for SMEs Standard.
BC66
In considering the R&M differences between AASB 16 Leases and Section 20 Leases in the IFRS for SMEs 
Standard, the Board noted that the accounting for all leases held by lessees under AASB 16 is broadly similar 
to the the accounting for finance leases in the IFRS for SMEs Standard. As a consequence, the Board 
considered that the disclosures for finance leases should be used as a basis, and only be adapted for different 
terminology used in AASB 16 (eg referring to variable lease payments instead of contingent rent). 
BC67
The Board also decided in principle to adapt the current disclosures for operating leases to apply to short-
term leases and leases of low value assets that have not been recognised as right-of-use assets per the 
exemption in paragraph 6 of AASB 16. However, the Board noted that the disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs 
Standard about operating lease commitments are more extensive than what is required under paragraphs 55 
and 60 of AASB 16. AASB 16 is a recent Standard that was finalised after the IFRS for SMEs Standard was 
developed. As noted in paragraph BC40, the Board considered that where the IASB has removed disclosures 
from full IFRS after the IFRS for SMEs Standard was finalised, similar reductions in disclosures should also 
be carried over to the new Tier 2 Standard. Therefore, the Board decided to replace the disclosures in the 
IFRS for SMEs Standard with the relevant disclosures from AASB 16. 
BC68
In considering the R&M differences between AASB 15 and Section 23 Revenue in the IFRS for SMEs 
Standard, the Board noted that while the differences may affect the amount and timing of the revenue 
recognised, under both AASB 15 and Section 23, revenue is either recognised at a point in time or over time. 
On that basis, the Board decided to adapt the disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs Standard to reflect the different 
terminology used in AASB 15 but without adding unnecessary details. For example, the requirement to 
disclose specified categories of revenue has been replaced with a requirement to disaggregate revenue into 
categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows are affected 
by economic factors. The reference to “methods used to determine the stage of completion” has been changed 
to “methods used to recognise revenue for performance obligations that are satisfied over time”. 
BC69
In considering the difference between AASB 123 Borrowing Costs and Section 25 Borrowing Costs in the 
IFRS for SMEs Standard, the Board noted that the IFRS for SMEs Standard does not permit the capitalisation 
of borrowing costs and therefore does not require any additional disclosures. As this is an R&M difference, 
the Board decided to require disclosure of the amount of capitalised borrowing costs on the grounds that total 
interest is an important element for a user to understand liquidity and solvency of an entity, and that 
information about these amounts capitalised would therefore be relevant. The Board further considered that 
the benefits of this disclosure would exceed the cost, noting that it is was also required for RDR entities. 
BC70
Based on the principle to avoid differences to the IFRS for SMEs Standard as far as possible, the Board 
decided to retain certain disclosures even though they were not required for RDR entities. These include:
(a)
in relation to the section covering employee benefits, disclosures about termination benefits which 
are over and above what is required under full IFRS/AAS (paragraphs 173(d),(g), 174-175);
(b)
disclosures about the entity’s domicile and other general information (paragraph 32), the qualitative 
factors that make up goodwill (paragraph 142(g)), adjusting events that occurred after the end of 
the reporting period (paragraph 185) and parent-subsidiary relationships where an entity applies 
the exemption from providing related party disclosures for government-related entities (paragraph 
200);
(c)
disclosures about hedging (paragraphs 121 and 122), investments in associates (paragraph 126) and 
leasing (paragraphs 144(b), 147(d) and 148(b)) where some disclosures were added but many 
others removed as a result of applying the principles in paragraph BC41; and
(d)
a number of disclosures in relation to the section covering transition to Australian Accounting 
Standards – Simplified Disclosures – see paragraph BC100 for details.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
BC71
While acknowledging stakeholders concerns about the potential increase in disclosures, the Board noted that 
the small increases will be more than offset with the reduction in disclosures in other areas. On this basis, the 
Board agreed to retain the disclosures from IFRS for SMEs Standard, which have been demonstrated to be 
appropriate for small and medium sized entities without public accountability. However, consistent with the 
principles in paragraph BC40, the Board agreed to remove disclosures about specific components of 
capitalised defined benefit cost, group plans and other long-term benefits from the disclosures proposed in 
ED 295 as these disclosures had been included in full IFRS when the IFRS for SMEs Standard was first issued, 
but had since been removed from full IFRS. 
BC72
In relation to the adjusting events after the end of the reporting period, the Board noted that paragraph 185 
specifically refers to an update of ‘related disclosures’, which is different to the equivelant requirements in 
AASB 110 Events after the Reporting Period, where paragraph 8 requires the adjustment of amounts 
recognised in the financial statements and paragraphs 19 and 20 deal with disclosure-related adjustments. 
While RDR entities were not required to comply with paragraphs 19 and 20 of AASB 110, the Board noted 
that paragraph 185 refers only to disclosures that relate to amounts recognised in the financial statements and 
is therefore narrower than the requirements in paragraphs 19 and 20 of AASB 110. On that basis, the Board 
did not consider the requirements to be particularly onerous and decided to retain them consistent with the 
principle of consistency with the IFRS for SMEs Standard.  
BC73
In considering differences between AASB 138 Intangible Assets and Section 18 Intangible Assets other than 
Goodwill in the IFRS for SMEs Standard, the Board noted that the IFRS for SMEs Standard does not permit 
the revaluation of intangible assets and therefore does not require relevant disclosures. The Board decided 
that these disclosures would be relevant and should be added, using the disclosures for property plant and 
equipment from paragraph 17.33 of the IFRS for SMEs Standard as a basis. The Board also decided to add a 
requirement to disclose the reason for an intangible asset having an indefinite useful life based on AASB 140 
Investment Property paragraph 122(a), as this option is not available under the IFRS for SMEs Standard. 
BC74
However, the IFRS for SMEs Standard also requires for revalued property, plant and equipment the disclosure 
of the carrying amount of the assets that would have been recognised under the cost model (paragraph 
17.33(d) in the IFRS for SMEs Standard). The Board noted that the option to use the revaluation model for 
property, plant and equipment was only introduced into the IFRS for SMEs Standard as part of the 
amendments made in 2015. While the Basis for Conclusions to the amendments explain the reasons for 
permitting this option11, they do not discuss the associated disclosures that were added in the process. When 
the Board discussed this particular disclosure requirement in the context of the original RDR disclosures in 
ED 192 Revised Differential Reporting Framework, it noted that the revaluation model provides more relevant 
information than the cost model, and that it would appear illogical and irrelevant to provide comparative 
information about the cost model12. The Board therefore concluded that the cost of this disclosure would 
outweigh the benefits. These arguments are still valid and on that basis the Board decided not to include this 
particular disclosure from the IFRS from SMEs Standard. 
Audit fees
BC75
Stakeholders were generally supportive of adding the requirement to disclose the fees paid to each auditor 
and reviewer, including any network firm, from AASB 1054 to AASB 1060 (paragraphs 98 and 99). The 
Board considered that the disclosure of audit fees is a public policy issue (see paragraph BC42) and requiring 
this disclosure will assist in improving auditor independence and accountability, thereby increasing users’ 
confidence in the quality of companies’ financial reports. The Board noted that the term ‘network firm’ is 
defined in APES 110 Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by Accounting and Professional 
Ethical Standards Board (APESB) (November 2018 incorporating all amendments to April 2018) and that 
preparers and auditors may refer to APES 110 for guidance. 
Maturity Analysis
BC76
A number of respondents to ED 295 and roundtable participants noted an inconsistency in disclosures about 
the maturity of financial liabilities. While paragraph 144(b) (paragraph 20.13(b) in the IFRS for SMEs 
Standard) requires disclosure of a quantitative maturity analysis for future lease payments of lessees in fixed 
time periods, paragraph 114 (paragraph 11.42 in the IFRS for SMEs Standard) only has a general requirement 
for other financial liabilities to disclose terms and conditions “such as … maturity, repayment schedule …”. 
BC77
The Board acknowledged that information about the maturity of an entity’s financial liabilities is important 
as the users of financial statements of entities that do not have public accountability are particularly interested

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
in information about short-term cash flows, obligations and commitments, and liquidity. However, as 
stakeholder feedback on this issue was mixed, the Board decided to retain the disclosures consistent with the 
IFRS for SMEs Standard. Noting that the IFRS for SMEs disclosures, in particular the leasing disclosures, are 
currently being reviewed by the IASB, the Board decided to flag the inconsistency in the disclosures to the 
IASB instead. 
BC78
However, The Board also noted that while paragraph 114 only has general disclosure requirements, these still 
require disclosure of the terms and conditions of the debt instrument and make specific reference to the 
instruments’ maturity and repayment schedule. The Board therefore expects entities to provide this 
information in some form. 
Tax reconciliation
BC79
Consistent with the disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs Standard, ED 295 only required disclosure of a narrative 
explanation of any significant differences between the tax expense (income) and accounting profit multiplied 
by the applicable tax rate without requiring a numerical reconciliation. Stakeholder feedback on this proposed 
reduction in disclosures was mixed. Amongst others, the Australian Taxation Office noted that the audited 
tax reconciliation is an important source of information for its risk identification and assessment purposes.
BC80
After considering the stakeholders’ feedback, the Board decided to require disclosure of a numerical tax 
reconciliation (paragraph 178(c)) on the basis that this is a public policy issue. The Board further noted that 
there has been significant interest in the income tax disclosures not only by regulators but also by the public 
in general, as part of the focus on possible tax avoidance in particular by multi-national entities. 
Individually material items of income and expenses
BC81
Some respondents to ED 295 were concerned about the absence of a specific requirement to disclose 
individually material items of income and expenses and noted that this disclosure is currently explicitly 
required for both RDR GPFS and SPFS. While the Board acknowledged these concerns, it noted that entities 
applying this Standard are still expected to disclose information that is not presented elsewhere but that is 
relevant to an understanding of the financial statement in accordance with paragraph 91(c). This would 
include information about individually material items of income and expense where information about these 
items is necessary to assess the entity’s financial performance. 
BC82
However, the Board, also agreed to monitor entities’ disclosure practices and may revisit this issue should it 
become apparent that entities do not provide sufficient disclosures in this regard. 
Imputation credits
BC83
In response to stakeholders’ feedback, the Board decided to add in paragraphs 100–103 the disclosure of 
imputation credits from paragraphs 12–15 in AASB 1054. The Board noted that, although the disclosure of 
imputation credits was not required under the current RDR framework, it was mandatory for entities preparing 
SPFS under Part 2M.3 of the Corporations Act 2001 and therefore it should not be onerous to provide for the 
majority of entities transitioning from SPFS to the new Tier 2 GPFS. 
BC84
The Board noted that Australia and New Zealand are among a limited number of jurisdictions that have an 
imputation tax regime and information about imputation credits provides useful information as the credits 
have the characteristics of an asset to equity investors. Moreover, published research demonstrates that the 
franking status of dividends increases the association between dividends and future earnings and therefore 
provides useful information about an entity’s future earnings potential and short-term cash flows.13 Requiring 
the disclosure will ensure that information about the entity’s imputation credits will not be lost when entities 
transition from SPFS to this Standard.
Specific transition disclosure requirements in another Standard
BC85
The Board noted that other Australian Accounting Standards may provide transition options for entities on 
initial application and that these options may be accompanied by specific transition disclosure requirements. 
Examples of such transition options can be found in AASB 15, AASB 16, AASB 1058 Income of Not-for-
Profit Entities or AASB 1059 Service Concession Arrangements: Grantors. The Board decided that where 
this is the case, the entity shall apply the relevant specific transition disclosures that are required under that

AASB 1060-compiled
73
BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
Standard for the selected transition option instead of the disclosures for a change in accounting policy 
specified in paragraph 106 of this Standard.
BC86
This is because even though the specific transition option under another Standard may require additional 
disclosures compared to what would be required under paragraph 106, the Board noted that the targeted 
disclosures of the selected transition option provide more relevant information about the transitional impact 
than the general accounting policy change disclosures required under paragraph 106. 
BC87
For example, where an entity adopts AASB 16 using the simplified transition approach and does not restate 
comparative information, AASB 16 paragraph C12 requires disclosure of an explanation of the differences 
between operating lease commitments disclosed under AASB 117 Leases at the end of the previous annual 
reporting period to the lease liabilities recognised in the statement of financial position at the date of initial 
application under AASB 16, together with the weighted average lessee’s incremental borrowing rate applied 
to the lease liabilities recognised at the date of initial application. In addition, the entity must also disclose 
whether it has used any of the specified practical expedients when adopting AASB 16. This provides more 
relevant information than a disclosure of the adjustments recognised for each financial statement line item 
affected by the new accounting policy in paragraph 106(b) for the current and each prior period presented.
AASB Standards and Interpretations not covered in AASB 1060
BC88
There are a number of Standards that the Board decided not to address in this Standard for the following 
reasons:
(a)
AASB 14 Regulatory Deferral Accounts as it would only be relevant for entities that have 
recognised regulatory deferral account balances under their current accounting policy (eg where 
the entity prepared SPFS without complying with the R&M of full AAS). None of the respondents 
to ED 295 identified any entities that intend to apply AASB 14 on transition to GPFS. The Board’s 
decision also is consistent with IASB’s view that it should not incorporate the requirements of 
IFRS 14 as part of the current comprehensive review of the IFRS for SMEs Standard14;
(b)
AASB 4 Insurance Contracts, AASB 17 Insurance Contracts, AASB 1023 General Insurance 
Contracts, AASB 1038 Life Insurance Contarcts and AASB 1056 Superannuation Entities are not 
addressed in this Standard as the majority of the entities applying these Standards would have 
public accountability by holding assets in a fiduciary capacity. 
The Board acknowledged that AASB 4 and AASB 17 would also be applicable to entities such as 
‘captive insurers’ which may not be publicly accountable and hence would be eligible to apply this 
Standard. These entities will have to provide the full disclosures of AASB 4 or AASB 17, as the 
disclosures in these standards have not been replaced by AASB 1060. However, the Board was of 
the view that ‘captive insurers’ deal only with insurance contracts within their own group and as a 
result are likely to have relatively simple insurance arrangements. They would therefore not be 
unduly impacted by the full disclosure requirements under these Standards. 
In relation to AASB 1056, the Board concluded that superannuation entities are currently divided 
between Tier 1 entities and non-reporting entities (including Small Australian Prudential 
Regulation Authority (APRA) Funds (SAFs) and Self-Managed Superannuation Funds (SMSFs)). 
Accordingly, Tier 2 disclosures were not developed for these entities. The Board further noted that 
there is currently no legislative requirements for superannuation entities to prepare financial 
statements in accordance with AAS. Until such time as the legislation is changed, superannaution 
entities could therefore continue preparing SPFS and thus AASB 1056 has been excluded from this 
Standard. 
(c)
AASB 8 Operating Segments and AASB 133 Earnings per Share require disclosure of segment 
information and of earnings per share data only for entities which have debt or equity instruments 
that are traded, or are in the process of being issued for trading in a public market. These entities 
would have public accountability and, accordingly, the Board decided that these Standards are not 
applicable for Tier 2 entities. Instead, consistent with the IFRS for SMEs Standard, paragraph 33 
refers back to these Standards and provides that an entity disclosing segment information or 
earnings per share must comply with AASB 8 or AASB 133 respectively in full. 
(d)
AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting is applicable for the specific purpose of preparing interim 
financial reports and AASB 1039 Concise Financial Reports is applicable for the specific purpose 
of preparing concise reports under the Corporations Act 2001. AASB 1060 is intended to be used 
in the preparation of annual GPFS. Accordingly, the Board considered that AASB 134 and 
AASB 1039 are not relevant in relation to this disclosure Standard.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
(e)
The majority of the disclosures from AASB 1054 are now covered in AASB 1060: paragraphs 7 
and 8 of AASB 1054 are covered in paragraphs 10–11 of AASB 1060, paragraphs 10 and 11 of 
AASB 1054 are covered in paragraphs 98 and 99 of AASB 1060 as discussed in paragraph BC75 
and paragraphs 12–15 of AASB 1054 are covered in paragraphs 100–103 of AASB 1060 as 
discussed in paragraphsBC83–BC84. Paragraph 9 of AASB 1054 will no longer be relevant as it 
refers to SPFS and paragraph 16 of AASB 1054 does not provide information about short-term 
cash flows, obligations, commitment, contingencies, liquidity or solvency and is therefore not 
required.
(f)
AASB 1057 and AASB 1053 do not include any R&M or disclosure requirements and as a result 
have not been included in this Standard.
BC89
In assessing whether disclosure requirements of a particular AASB Interpretation would need to be added to 
AASB 1060, the Board has considered the following:
(a)
If the Basis for Conclusions in the IFRS for SMEs Standard confirmed that particular interpretations 
had been incorporated in the IFRS for SMEs Standard, no further action was required.
(b)
No action was required for interprations that have been superseded or do not have any disclosure 
requirements. 
BC90
The Board further considered whether disclosure requirements from AASB Interpretations would need to be 
added to AASB 1060 but concluded this was not necessary for the following reasons:for the following 
reasons:
(a)
AASB Interpretation 1019 The Superannuation Contributions Surcharge and AASB Interpretation 
1047 Professional Indemnity Claims Liabilities in Medical Defence Organisations are not relevant 
for Tier 2 entities, as entities applying these interpretations would have public accountability by 
holding assets in a fiduciary capacity.
(b)
The disclosures in AASB Interpretation 1052 Tax Consolidation Accounting Disclosure were 
excluded for RDR entities on the basis of cost-benefit considerations. In addition, as the 
interpretation is not creating any R&M differences to IAS 12, and therefore also not to the IFRS 
for SMEs Standard, the Board concluded that additional disclosures will not be required.
(c)
The disclosure paragraphs in AASB Interpretation 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments do 
not introduce new disclosures, but refer to disclosures in the AASB 112 that are captured in 
paragraphs 96, 97 and 154 of AASB 1060. 
(d)
Two of the three disclosure paragraphs in AASB Interpretation 5 Rights to Interests arising from 
Decommissioning, Restoration and Environmental Rehabilitation Funds were already excluded for 
Tier 2 entities on the basis of cost-benefit considerations. However, as there are also no R&M 
differences to the IFRS for SMEs Standard, the Board concluded that no additional disclosures 
would be required.
Not-for-profit private sector entities and public sector entities 
BC91
As explained in paragraph BC51, the Board decided that AASB 1060 should be equally applicable to both 
for-profit and NFP private sector entities and any public sector entities that are eligible to report under Tier 2 
based on the requirements in AASB 1053. The Board therefore also considered any NFP private sector and 
public sector entity differences in AAS and to what extent, if any, additional disclosures would be required 
for such Tier 2 entities. 
BC92
In summary, the Board decided to:
(a)
include additional disclosures for AASB 1, AASB 16, AASB 102 and AASB 123 to address R&M 
differences that are specific to NFP entities; and
(b)
include additional disclosures for AASB 1004, AASB 1050, AASB 1051, AASB 1055, 
AASB 1058 and AASB 1059 which are only applicable for NFP private sector and/or public sector 
entities. 
Consistent with the conclusions in paragraph BC53, the proposed disclosures reflect the fact that the relevant 
transactions and circumstances covered are unique to NFP private sector and/or public sector entities and that 
users would require information on non-financial accountability and stewardship, even if the broad principles 
in paragraph BC41 would not indicate such a need. 
BC93
As a general rule, the Board considered that previous decisions made under the current RDR framework in 
relation to the cost vs the benefits of these disclosures in relation to Tier 2 NFP entities remain relevant.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
Drafting conventions and future maintenance
BC94
While ED 295 used the numbering from the IFRS for SMEs Standard, the Board agreed to use consecutive 
paragraph numbers in this Standard consistent with the approach used in other AAS. To show the linkage to 
the IFRS for SMEs disclosures and allow easy comparison, equivalent IFRS for SMEs paragraph numbers are 
added at the end of each paragraph where applicable.  Where paragraphs from the IFRS for SMEs Standard 
have been amended, the words ‘based on’ are used. 
BC95
The Board further decided that the analysis tables developed for ED 295 (See Detailed comparison of R&M 
requirements in IFRS for SMEs Standard and full IFRS and analysis of impact on disclosures – For for-profit 
private sector entities with no public accountability and Analysis of NFP modifications paragraphs in AAS 
and NFP specific AASB Standards for detailed analysis) will include all the edits and mark-ups and will be 
used as an ongoing document for future reference. They will be a record of the rationale behind certain 
decisions and judgements and would facilitate any future amendments. 
BC96
The Board also acknowledged that a review of the disclosures will need to take place any time the IFRS for 
SMEs Standard is updated, a new Australian Accounting Standard or Interpretation is issued or amendments 
are made to existing Australian Accounting Standards or Interpretations. 
Transitional requirements
BC97
The Board considered whether specific transitional requirements needed to be added to AASB 1053 in 
relation to AASB 1060, but has concluded that this is not necessary for the following reasons:
(a)
adjustments to recognised amounts will only arise where an entity did not previously report either 
under Tier 1 or Tier 2 (RDR); and
(b)
the principles of transitioning to full R&M requirements are the same, regardless of the level of 
disclosures to be provided.
BC98
Therefore, the Board concluded that the transition requirements in paragraph 18A of AASB 1053 can be 
retained without further changes (except some changes required by AASB 2020-2 to clarify the scope of the 
paragraph for certain entities required to consolidate for the first time). However, the Board decided to add 
an explanatory paragraph 18C to AASB 1053 which confirms the different disclosures that apply to Tier 2 
entities that apply this Standard. 
BC99
The Board acknowledged that the adoption of this new Tier 2 Standard as such will not result in any 
adjustments to recognised amounts unless an entity has not previously complied with all R&M requirements 
of AAS and is preparing GPFS for the first time. Separate transition relief has been provided in Appendix E 
of AASB 1053 Application of Tiers of Australian Accounting Standards for entities moving from SPFS to 
Tier 2 GPFS when adopting the requirements of AASB 2020-2. Further discussion of the Board’s 
consideration on this matter is available in AASB 2020-2 paragraphs BC122−BC144.
BC100
The Board also decided to retain the requirements to explain how the adoption of AAS has affected the entity’s 
financial position, financial performance and cash flows, and to disclose a description of each change in 
accounting policy, a reconciliation of the profit and loss for the latest period before adoption, and information 
about any errors noted in the context of the adoption (paragraphs 208, 210(c), 211 and 212 of this Standard) 
even though they were not previously required for RDR entities, to keep differences to the IFRS for SMEs 
Standard at a minimum.
Effective date
BC101
In proposing the effective date in ED 295, the Board had noted that the revised Conceptual Framework as 
issued by the IASB in March 2018 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2020 and 
that the regulations in relation to doubling of thresholds for large proprietary companies are applicable to 
financial years beginning on or after 1 July 2019.
BC102
With these factors in mind and in order to provide an option for large proprietary companies to early adopt 
AASB 1060, the Board had proposed that AASB 1060 should be ready for adoption latest by 30 June 2020, 
to be effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2020.
BC103
However, respondents to ED 295 and ED 297 expressed mixed views on the proposed effective date, with 
many recommending the Board defer the effective date of both standards by one to two years. After 
considering the arguments provided by stakeholders and various options, the Board ultimately decided to 
defer the effective date of both standards by one year to financial years beginning on or after 1 July 2021, 
with early adoption permitted.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
Basis for Conclusions on AASB 2020-7
This Basis for Conclusions accompanies, but is not part of, AASB 1060.  The Basis for Conclusions was originally 
published with AASB 2020-7 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions: 
Tier 2 Disclosures.
Introduction
BC1
This Basis for Conclusions summarises the Australian Accounting Standards Board’s considerations in 
reaching the conclusions in this Standard. It sets out the reasons why the Board developed the Standard, the 
approach taken to developing the Standard and the bases for key decisions made. In making decisions, 
individual Board members gave greater weight to some factors than to others.
Reasons for proposing amendments to AASB 1060
BC2
In June 2020, the Board issued AASB 2020-4 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Covid-19-
Related Rent Concessions to make amendments to AASB 16 Leases to provide lessees with an optional 
exemption from assessing whether a COVID-19-related rent concession is a lease modification. The 
amendments added a new paragraph 60A to AASB 16, which requires an entity applying the practical 
expedient to disclose:
(a)
that it has applied the practical expedient to all rent concessions that meet the conditions in 
paragraph 46B of AASB 16 or, if not applied to all such rent concessions, information about the 
nature of the contracts to which it has applied the practical expedient; and
(b)
the amount recognised in profit or loss for the reporting period to reflect changes in lease payments 
that arise from rent concessions to which the lessee has applied the practical expedient in paragraph 
46A of AASB 16.
BC3
The amendments further provide relief from providing the information required by AASB 108 Accounting 
Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors paragraph 28(f) in the reporting period in which the 
lessee first applies the amendments made by AASB 2020-4 through paragraph C20B of AASB 16.
BC4
The Board considered whether these disclosures should also apply to entities that intend to adopt AASB 1060 
General Purpose Financial Statements – Simplified Disclosures for For-Profit and Not-for-Profit Tier 2 
Entities. The Board referred to the principles used when developing the disclosures in AASB 1060, which are 
described in paragraphs BC34–BC50 in the Basis for Conclusions to that Standard. In particular:
(a)
the disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs Standard should be retained where the recognition and 
measurement (R&M) requirements and options are the same or similar in the IFRS for SMEs 
Standard and full IFRS Standards (and therefore Australian Accounting Standards);
(b)
where R&M options or treatments in the IFRS for SMEs Standard are not available in full IFRS 
Standards (and therefore Australian Accounting Standards), the related IFRS for SMEs disclosures 
are removed; and
(c)
where the R&M principles in full IFRS Standards (and therefore Australian Accounting Standards) 
are significantly different from those in the IFRS for SMEs Standard or certain topics are not 
addressed in the IFRS for SMEs Standard, disclosures may be added. To determine whether to add 
any disclosures, the Board refers to the principles applied by the IASB in developing the disclosures 
in the IFRS for SMEs Standard, which are set out in paragraph BC8 below.
In addition to applying these principles, the Board also considers whether to add disclosures to address matters 
of public policy or to reflect Australian-specific issues.
BC5
Based on these principles, the Board agreed to use the following approach when considering whether to add 
to or amend disclosure requirements in AASB 1060 in relation to amendments made by the IASB to full IFRS 
Standards:
(a)
if the amendments introduce significant R&M differences between full IFRS Standards and the 
IFRS for SMEs Standard, apply the principles applied by the IASB in developing the IFRS for 
SMEs Standard, as summarised in paragraph BC8; 
Authorised Version F2025C00209 registered 06/03/2025

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AASB 1060-compiled
78
BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
(b)
if the amendments do not introduce significant R&M differences, no further action is required 
unless the disclosures address a matter of public policy or are of particular relevance in the 
Australian environment.
BC6
In relation to the COVID-19-related rent concessions, the Board noted that the IFRS for SMEs Standard does 
not discuss how to account for lease modifications. Paragraph 10.4 of the IFRS for SMEs Standard explains 
that management shall use its judgement in developing and applying accounting policies that result in relevant 
and reliable information. Paragraph 10.6 further states that in making the judgement, management may also 
consider the requirements and guidance in full IFRS Standards dealing with similar and related issues. It is 
therefore possible that the expedient provided under full IFRS Standards may not result in significant 
differences in the R&M requirements. On that basis, it would arguably not be necessary to consider whether 
to add any disclosures to AASB 1060.
BC7
However, as the practical expedient introduces a significant exemption from the accounting principles in 
AASB 16 that is only available to entities in the limited circumstances set out in AASB 16 paragraph 46B, 
the Board was of the view that this would be a situation where additional disclosures may be warranted.
BC8
The Board therefore referred to the principles applied by the IASB in developing the disclosures in the IFRS 
for SMEs Standard. These principles consider that users of the financial statements of for-profit entities that 
are not publicly accountable are particularly interested in information about:
(a)
short-term cash flows and obligations, commitments or contingencies, whether or not recognised 
as liabilities;
(b)
liquidity and solvency;
(c)
measurement uncertainties;
(d)
accounting policy choices; and
(e)
disaggregations of amounts presented in the financial statements.
The principles further note that some disclosures in full IFRS Standards are more relevant to investment 
decisions in public capital markets than to transactions and other events and conditions encountered by entities 
without public accountability.
BC9
Applying the practical expedient in AASB 16 paragraph 46A is an accounting policy choice. Entities would 
therefore already be required to explain if they have used the expedient, and to what extent, when describing 
their accounting policies and the basis of preparation of their financial statements under paragraph 95(b) of 
AASB 1060. However, the Board noted that adding a specific disclosure requirement to AASB 1060 would 
ensure all entities applying the expedient state this fact in their basis of preparation, regardless of whether 
they are reporting under Tier 1 or Tier 2. Providing information about accounting policy choices made by the 
entity is further supported by the principle in paragraph BC8(d).
BC10
In relation to the amount recognised in profit or loss for the reporting period, the Board noted that this provides 
information about the disaggregation of amounts presented in the statement of profit or loss, and is hence 
supported by paragraph BC8(e). The disclosure may also provide further insights about the entity’s liquidity 
and solvency (paragraph BC8(b)) and would improve the comparability of financial statements of lessees that 
have applied the practical expedient and those that have not.
BC11
Furthermore, if the entity had applied AASB 16 in a prior period, adopting the practical expedient would be 
a change in accounting policy and the entity would have to disclose the impact of this change on the current 
and prior periods under paragraph 28(f) of AASB 108, but for the disclosure relief added to AASB 16 
(paragraph C20B) by AASB 2020-4. Noting that there should be no impact on prior periods as the practical 
expedient is limited to COVID-19-related rent concessions, disclosing the amount recognised in profit or loss 
for the reporting period would provide essentially the same information as required under AASB 1060 
paragraph 106(b), which is the equivalent paragraph to AASB 108 paragraph 28(f). Requiring disclosure of 
the amount recognised in profit or loss but providing relief from compliance with paragraph 106(b) would 
therefore not result in any additional disclosures being required under AASB 1060.
BC12
Considering that the proposed new requirements are not expected to result in an increase in disclosures, the 
Board agreed to propose amendments to AASB 1060 that would replicate the disclosure changes made to 
AASB 16 and AASB 108 by AASB 2020-4. The Board further noted that the additional disclosures would 
apply only to COVID-19-related rent concessions and were warranted because of the special circumstances 
leading to the practical expedient in AASB 16. The amendments do not alter the fact that disclosure of variable 
lease payments is not required under the IFRS for SMEs Standard and therefore also not required under 
AASB 1060.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
Tier 2 Reduced Disclosure Requirements
BC13
The Board also considered whether the new disclosures in AASB 16 should be reduced for entities reporting 
under the Tier 2 Reduced Disclosure Requirements (RDR) framework (Tier 2 RDR entities). In doing so, the 
Board referred to the ‘user need’ and ‘cost-benefit’ principles set out in the ‘Tier 2 Disclosure Principles’ 
document of the RDR decision-making framework. These principles were also based on the principles applied 
by the IASB in developing the disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs Standard and are the same as those 
summarised in paragraph BC8.
BC14
The considerations in paragraphs BC9–BC12 are therefore also relevant for Tier 2 RDR entities. Disclosure 
of the accounting policies applied by the entity is already required under AASB 101 Presentation of Financial 
Statements paragraph 117(b), and without the relief introduced by paragraph C20B of AASB 16, entities that 
had previously applied AASB 16 would need to disclose the impact of the change in accounting policy on 
each financial statement line item affected.
BC15
On that basis, the Board took the view that the additional disclosures introduced by AASB 16 paragraph 60A 
should not be reduced for Tier 2 RDR entities and the disclosure relief in paragraph C20B should be available 
to such entities. This approach would mean that no further changes would need to be made to AASB 16 in 
relation to Tier 2 RDR.
Issue of ED 303 Covid-19-Related Rent Concessions: Tier 2 Disclosures
BC16 
The Board’s proposals were exposed for public comment in July 2020 through Exposure Draft ED 303 Covid-
19-Related Rent Concessions: Tier 2 Disclosures. Noting that the practical expedient added to AASB 16 is 
already available for early adoption as at 30 June 2020, the Board agreed on a short exposure period of 14 
days from the day of issue of the ED. The Board received feedback through two submissions and discussions 
with stakeholders, which were supportive of the proposed amendments. The Board therefore decided to 
finalise and approve the amendments as proposed.
Operative date and early application
BC17
While the amendments made by AASB 2020-4 are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or 
after 1 June 2020, the Board noted that AASB 1060 does not become operative until annual reporting periods 
beginning on or after 1 July 2021. The specified operative date for the amendments made by this Standard 
therefore could not be earlier than 1 July 2021. However, the Board considered that entities should be required 
to apply these amendments earlier if they apply both:
(a)
AASB 1060; and
(b)
the practical expedient in paragraph 46A of AASB 16;
to a reporting period beginning before 1 July 2021.

This Basis for Conclusions accompanies, but is not part of, AASB 1060.  The Basis for Conclusions was originally 
published with AASB 2020-9 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Tier 2 Disclosures: Interest Rate 
Benchmark Reform (Phase 2) and Other Amendments.
Introduction
BC1
This Basis for Conclusions summarises the Australian Accounting Standards Board’s considerations in 
reaching the conclusions in this Standard. It sets out the reasons why the Board developed the Standard, the 
approach taken to developing the Standard and the bases for key decisions made. In making decisions, 
individual Board members gave greater weight to some factors than to others. 
Tier 2 Simplified Disclosures – amendments to AASB 1060
BC2
In September 2020, the Board issued AASB 2020-8 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – 
Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2 to help entities to provide financial statement users with useful 
information about the effects of the interest rate benchmark reform on those entities’ financial statements. 
New paragraphs 24I and 24J were added to AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures to require an entity 
applying the amendments to disclose information about: 
(a)
the nature and extent of risks to which the entity is exposed arising from financial instruments 
subject to interest rate benchmark reform, and how the entity manages these risks; and
(b)
the entity’s progress in completing the transition to alternative benchmark rates and how the entity 
is managing the transition.
BC3
The amendments also give relief from providing the information otherwise required by AASB 108 Accounting 
Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors paragraph 28(f) in the reporting period in which the 
entity first applies the amendments made by AASB 2020-8 through new paragraph 44HH of AASB 7.
Reasons for not adding any disclosures to AASB 1060
BC4
The Board considered whether the new disclosures should also apply to entities that intend to adopt 
AASB 1060 General Purpose Financial Statements – Simplified Disclosures for For-Profit and Not-for-
Profit Tier 2 Entities. The Board referred to the principles used when developing the disclosures in 
AASB 1060, in particular:
(a)
the disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs Standard should be retained where the recognition and 
measurement (R&M) requirements and options are the same or similar in the IFRS for SMEs 
Standard and full IFRS Standards (and therefore Australian Accounting Standards); 
(b)
where R&M options or treatments in the IFRS for SMEs Standard are not available in full IFRS 
Standards (and therefore Australian Accounting Standards), the related IFRS for SMEs disclosures 
are removed; and
(c)
where the R&M principles in full IFRS Standards (and therefore Australian Accounting Standards) 
are significantly different from those in the IFRS for SMEs Standard or certain topics are not 
addressed in the IFRS for SMEs Standard, disclosures may be added. To determine whether to add 
any disclosures, the Board refers to the principles applied by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB) in developing the disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs Standard, which are 
set out in paragraph BC5.
In addition to applying these principles, the Board also considers whether to add disclosures to address matters 
of public policy or to reflect Australian-specific issues.
BC5
The principles applied by the IASB in developing the disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs Standard consider 
that users of the financial statements of for-profit entities that are not publicly accountable are particularly 
interested in information about: 
(a)
short-term cash flows and obligations, commitments or contingencies, whether or not recognised 
as liabilities;
(b)
liquidity and solvency;

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
(c)
measurement uncertainties; 
(d)
accounting policy choices; and
(e)
disaggregations of amounts presented in the financial statements.
The principles further note that some disclosures in full IFRS Standards are more relevant to investment 
decisions in public capital markets than to transactions and other events and conditions encountered by entities 
without public accountability.
BC6
Based on these principles of the Board and the IASB, the Board agreed to use the following approach when 
considering whether to add to or amend disclosure requirements in AASB 1060 in relation to amendments 
made by the IASB to full IFRS Standards:
(a)
if the amendments introduce significant R&M differences between full IFRS Standards and the 
IFRS for SMEs Standard, apply the principles applied by the IASB in developing the IFRS for 
SMEs Standard, as summarised in paragraph BC5; and
(b)
if the amendments do not introduce significant R&M differences, no further action is required 
unless the disclosures address a matter of public policy or are of particular relevance in the 
Australian environment.
BC7
The Board therefore considered whether the amendments made to AASB 9 Financial Instruments, AASB 4 
Insurance Contracts, AASB 16 Leases and AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement 
by AASB 2020-8 will result in significant R&M differences to the IFRS for SMEs Standard.
Differences arising from the practical expedient for particular changes to 
contractual cash flows
BC8
The Board noted that the IFRS for SMEs Standard does not deal with the impact of interest rate benchmark 
reform on financial reporting or provide a practical expedient for similar situations. The amendments to 
AASB 9 mean that the changes made to the basis for determining the contractual cash flows as a result of 
interest rate benchmark reform are accounted for in the same way as the re-estimation of future interest 
payments on variable-rate financial assets and financial liabilities. In particular, the rules on accounting for 
modifications of contractual cash flows in AASB 9 do not apply.
BC9
Paragraph 11.37 of the IFRS for SMEs Standard addresses substantial modifications only in the context of the 
derecognition of financial liabilities. However, given the IASB concluded that it would be unlikely that the 
transition to an alternative benchmark rate alone would result in the derecognition of a financial instrument, 
these requirements are not relevant for the assessment outlined in paragraph BC6. In terms of accounting for 
other modifications under the IFRS for SMEs Standard, an entity’s management would need to apply 
paragraph 10.4 and use its judgement in developing and applying accounting policies that result in relevant 
and reliable information. Paragraph 10.6 further states that in making the judgement, management may also 
consider the requirements and guidance in full IFRS Standards dealing with similar and related issues. The 
Board considered this could include the practical expedient for the interest rate benchmark reform in AASB 9.
BC10
The Board also noted that AASB 4 is not addressed in AASB 1060 as the majority of the entities applying 
AASB 4 would have public accountability. In respect of the amendments made to AASB 16 in relation to 
lease modifications required by interest rate benchmark reform, the Board considered that the IFRS for SMEs 
Standard does not discuss how to account for lease modifications. For the same reasons as set out in paragraph 
BC9, the Board concluded that the expedient introduced by the amendments to AASB 16 should not result in 
a significant R&M difference. In any case, the Board noted that there are no additional disclosures associated 
with the application of the practical expedient for leases.
BC11
The Board therefore concluded that the modifications arising as a result of interest rate benchmark reform 
should not result in significant R&M differences between the amended IFRS Standards and the IFRS for 
SMEs Standard that would warrant additional disclosures for Tier 2 entities applying the new Simplified 
Disclosures framework in AASB 1060.
Differences arising from the relief from specific hedge accounting 
requirements
BC12
The Board noted that the IFRS for SMEs Standard permits hedge accounting only for four specific types of 
instruments listed in the Standard, including interest rate swaps. While the IFRS for SMEs Standard is less 
restrictive regarding the types of risks that can qualify for hedge accounting and hedge ineffectiveness, it 
requires an entity to discontinue hedge accounting if:
(a)
the hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated;

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
(b)
the hedge no longer meets the conditions for hedge accounting specified in paragraph 12.16; or
(c)
the entity revokes the designation.
BC13
In the IFRS Interest Rate Benchmark Reform—Phase 2 amendments, the IASB observed that amending the 
formal designation of a hedging relationship to reflect changes required by the reform would result in the 
hedging relationship being discontinued. The Board noted this is because both AASB 9 (paragraph 6.4.1) and 
AASB 139 (paragraph 88) require the formal designation of a hedging relationship to be documented at 
inception as part of the qualifying criteria for hedge accounting to be applied. The hedge documentation 
includes identification of the hedging instrument, the hedged item, the nature of the risk being hedged and 
how the entity will assess hedge effectiveness. Although in limited circumstances AASB 9 permits the hedge 
documentation to be updated without resulting in the discontinuation of hedge accounting, AASB 139 
requires hedge accounting to be discontinued when any amendments are made to the hedge designation as 
documented at the inception of the hedging relationship.
BC14
The Board further noted that the term “at inception” is a notable omission in the IFRS for SMEs Standard. 
Given the absence of an explicit reference to the formal designation and documentation at the inception of a 
hedge in the IFRS for SMEs Standard, the Board took the view that changes to hedge designations and hedge 
documentation that are required as a result of the reform would not necessarily result in the discontinuation 
of hedge accounting under the IFRS for SMEs Standard. The relief from specific hedge accounting 
requirements introduced by the amendments to AASB 9 and AASB 139 is therefore unlikely to result in 
significant R&M differences.
Other considerations
BC15
The IFRS for SMEs Standard also permits accounting under IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement but does not require any additional disclosures beyond what is in the IFRS for SMEs Standard. 
The Board noted in the IASB’s Request for Information on the Comprehensive Review of the IFRS for SMEs 
Standard that the IASB is considering replacing the option of applying IAS 39 with an option to apply IFRS 9 
Financial Instruments, while still retaining the disclosures from the IFRS for SMEs Standard. The Board 
considered this further supports the argument that no additional disclosures from AASB 2020-8 should be 
required, as an entity applying the IFRS for SMEs Standard and IAS 39 or IFRS 9 would apply the Interest 
Rate Benchmark Reform—Phase 2 amendments and not be required to provide any additional disclosures 
under the view in the Request for Information.
BC16
The Board further considered whether the new disclosure requirements added to AASB 7 address a matter of 
public policy or are of particular relevance to the Australian environment but did not consider this to be the 
case. Finally, the Board noted that should interest rate benchmark reform have a material effect on an entity 
such that knowledge about the financial effects is necessary for an understanding of the financial statements, 
disclosure would still be required under the general provisions of paragraph 91 in AASB 1060. 
BC17
On that basis, the Board took the view that the additional disclosures introduced by AASB 7 paragraphs 24I 
and 24J should not be added to AASB 1060. 
Reasons for providing disclosure relief in AASB 1060
BC18
The Board noted that the IASB decided not to require entities to provide the disclosures otherwise required 
by IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors paragraph 28(f) because the cost 
of providing quantitative information about the effect of the changes in accounting policy that are associated 
with the amendments to IFRS Standards could outweigh the benefits. The Board took the view that this would 
similarly apply to entities reporting under AASB 1060 and therefore decided to introduce a similar exception 
into AASB 1060 by adding a new paragraph 107A. 
Tier 2 Reduced Disclosure Requirements
BC19
The Board also considered whether the new disclosure requirements in AASB 7 should be reduced for entities 
reporting under the Tier 2 Reduced Disclosure Requirements (RDR) framework (Tier 2 RDR entities). In 
doing so, the Board referred to the ‘user need’ and ‘cost-benefit’ principles set out in the ‘Tier 2 Disclosure 
Principles’ document of the RDR decision-making framework. These principles were also based on the 
principles applied by the IASB in developing the disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs Standard and are the same 
as those summarised in paragraph BC5.
BC20
The Board noted the disclosures would affect only those Tier 2 RDR entities with financial instruments such 
as variable-rate loans that are referenced to the interest rate benchmarks, including those that have designated 
hedging instruments in a hedge relationship, lessees with IBOR-linked leases and insurance companies

AASB 1060-compiled

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
applying the temporary exemption from AASB 9 with IBOR-linked insurance contracts. The Board does not 
expect many Tier 2 entities to be affected. 
BC21
The Board further considered that the disclosure requirements in paragraphs 24I and 24J(a) and (c) of AASB 7 
provide further detail about the entity’s risk management and hedging strategy. Tier 2 entities already disclose 
this information under paragraphs 22A and 22B of AASB 7. The additional disclosures are therefore 
consistent with the current level of RDR disclosures.
BC22
While Tier 2 entities applying RDR are not otherwise required to disclose quantitative information such as 
that required by paragraph 24J(b) of AASB 7, the Board considered that the information is expected:
(a)
to be available to an entity as a result of the implementation of the interest rate benchmark reform 
and therefore the preparation of such disclosure is not expected to be burdensome;
(b)
not to be onerous as the requirements allow entities to choose the basis for disclosing the 
quantitative information, thereby being able to leverage information already available, which would 
reduce costs while still providing useful information; and
(c)
to be required only for a limited period of time, as the application of the amendments in Phase 2 is 
associated with changes to financial instruments or hedging relationships subject to a particular 
reformed benchmark interest rate.
BC23
The disclosure requirements in paragraphs 24I and 24J of AASB 7 also require further information about the 
disaggregation of amounts presented in financial statements and the transactions and other events encountered 
by these entities. The Board referred to the Tier 2 Disclosure Principles summarised in paragraph BC5 and 
considered that where the amounts in question are material, user needs and the benefits of the information 
would outweigh the limited cost of preparing the disclosures.
BC24
The Board further considered that entities applying the amendments should not be required to disclose the 
information otherwise required by paragraph 28(f) of AASB 108. As this relief is provided to entities 
reporting under the Tier 1 framework, the Board took the view that it should also be available for Tier 2 
entities applying RDR so that they are not disadvantaged compared with entities reporting under Tier 1. 
BC25
The Board noted that the proposals would result in different disclosure requirements for Tier 2 entities 
applying the RDR framework compared with Tier 2 entities applying the Simplified Disclosure framework 
under AASB 1060. However, the Board considered this outcome would be consistent with the different 
approach used in developing AASB 1060 and the different starting points of the two Tier 2 disclosure 
frameworks. It demonstrates that the principles applied in developing the simplified disclosures can 
successfully reduce the disclosures for Tier 2 entities. Furthermore, the Board does not expect many Tier 2 
entities to be affected by interest rate benchmark reform and noted that Tier 2 entities would be able to apply 
AASB 1060 early if they preferred not to make these particular disclosures. Therefore, the Board considered 
the proposed disclosure requirements would not impose a significant burden on Tier 2 RDR entities.
BC26
On that basis, the Board took the view that the additional disclosure requirements introduced by AASB 7 
paragraphs 24I and 24J should not be reduced for Tier 2 RDR entities but that the relief from disclosing 
information about the financial effects of changes in accounting policy in paragraph 44HH should be available 
to such entities. This approach means that no further changes need to be made to AASB 7 in relation to Tier 2 
RDR.
Issue of ED 304 Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2: Tier 2 
Disclosures
BC27
The Board’s proposals were exposed for public comment in October 2020 through Exposure Draft ED 304 
Interest Rate Benchmark Reform – Phase 2: Tier 2 Disclosures. Noting that there may be entities intending 
to early adopt AASB 1060, the Board agreed on a short exposure period of 30 days from the day of issue of 
the ED to ensure the relief would be available when needed. The Board did not receive any written 
submissions on the ED, but did receive verbal feedback from one stakeholder that was generally supportive 
of the proposed amendments, other than the proposal for differing disclosure outcomes for the two types of 
Tier 2 entities. The Board reaffirmed the considerations set out in the Basis for Conclusions on this matter 
and decided to finalise and approve the amendments as proposed.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
Basis for Conclusions on AASB 2021-1
This Basis for Conclusions accompanies, but is not part of, AASB 1060.  The Basis for Conclusions was originally 
published with AASB 2021-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Transition to Tier 2: Simplified 
Disclosures for Not-for-Profit Entities.
Introduction
BC1
This Basis for Conclusions summarises the Australian Accounting Standards Board’s considerations in 
reaching the conclusions in this Standard. It sets out the reasons why the Board developed the Standard, the 
approach taken to developing the Standard and the bases for key decisions made. In making decisions, 
individual Board members gave greater weight to some factors than to others. 
Reasons for issuing this Standard
BC2
The Board noted that not-for-profit (NFP) entities transitioning from either Tier 1: Australian Accounting 
Standards or Tier 2: Australian Accounting Standards – Reduced Disclosure Requirements (RDR) and 
adopting Tier 2: Australian Accounting Standards – Simplified Disclosures (SD) early (ie for reporting 
periods beginning before 1 July 2021) would not be able to access the transitional relief that is available to 
for-profit private sector entities. For-profit private sector entities that transition between the Tier 2 
frameworks by adopting Tier 2 SD early are provided optional relief from presenting comparative information 
in the notes to the financial statements if the entity did not previously disclose the comparable information in 
its most recent previous financial statements. This relief is set out in paragraph E4 of AASB 1053 Application 
of Tiers of Australian Accounting Standards. For-profit private sector entities that transition from Tier 1 to 
Tier 2 SD early are also provided with this same optional disclosure relief.
BC3
To address this difference, the Board decided to make a narrow-scope amendment to AASB 1060 General 
Purpose Financial Statements – Simplified Disclosures for For-Profit and Not-for-Profit Tier 2 Entities to 
provide NFP entities with the same optional transition relief as for-profit entities when transitioning early 
from Tier 1 or Tier 2 RDR to Tier 2 SD.
Issue of Exposure Draft ED 306
BC4
The Board’s proposals with respect to the transition relief finalised in this Standard were exposed for public 
comment in December 2020 as part of Exposure Draft ED 306 Transition Between Tier 2 Frameworks for 
Not-for-Profit Entities. 
BC5
The significant issues considered by the Board in developing ED 306 are addressed in the following sections.
Scope
BC6
ED 306 proposed amendments to AASB 1060 to provide optional relief for NFP entities adopting AASB 1060 
early from having to present comparative information in the notes to the financial statements where the entity 
did not previously disclose the comparable information in its most recent previous Tier 2 general purpose 
financial statements. The ED proposed this relief would be available for NFP entities transitioning from Tier 2 
RDR to Tier 2 SD before the mandatory application date of AASB 1060. 
BC7
In developing ED 306, the Board also considered whether to extend to NFP entities other relief available to 
for-profit private sector entities under AASB 1053 Appendix E. For example, paragraphs E5–E7 provide 
optional relief from restating comparative information to for-profit private sector entities that had not 
complied with all the recognition and measurement requirements of Australian Accounting Standards 
(including, if a parent entity, not presenting consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with 
AASB 10 Consolidated Financial Statements) in their most recent previous special purpose financial 
statements (SPFS). 
BC8
However, when finalising the previous amendments to AASB 1053, the Board decided not to extend any 
additional relief to NFP entities, as that could result in the loss of useful, restated comparative information. 
The Board also noted that it had decided to grant such relief to for-profit private sector entities due to the 
removal of the ability of such entities to prepare SPFS, which does not apply to NFP entities. Transition by

AASB 1060-compiled
85
BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
NFP entities from SPFS to general purpose financial statements will be considered in more detail by the Board 
in its deliberations on the Board’s separate NFP Private Sector Financial Reporting Framework project. 
Location of amendments
BC9
The Board also considered whether to propose making the amendments to provide the optional transitional 
relief to AASB 1053 or to AASB 1060. While the equivalent relief for for-profit private sector entities is 
included in AASB 1053 (Appendix E), the Board decided that in this instance AASB 1060 was the more 
appropriate location. This is because the relief proposed in ED 306 would apply only to NFP entities that are 
transitioning early from Tier 2 RDR. The Board concluded that entities transitioning between the Tier 2 
frameworks would not normally refer to AASB 1053 for transition guidance as AASB 1053 deals with entities 
transitioning between tiers, rather than to new requirements relating to the same tier.
Other amendments
BC10
The Board also proposed some editorial improvements to AASB 1053 to highlight that the relief set out in 
Appendix E of AASB 1053 applies only to for-profit private sector entities.
Finalisation of ED 306 proposals
BC11
Following the consultation period, and after considering the comments received, the Board decided to proceed 
with issuing this Standard, with minimal changes from the proposals in ED 306. 
Feedback from respondents on ED 306
BC12
The Board received six formal comment letters on ED 306. The feedback received indicated that, in general, 
all respondents were supportive of the proposals. However, some respondents suggested that:
(a)
the Board should adopt a sector-neutral approach to transition relief. In their view, NFP entities 
should have the same transition relief as for-profit private sector entities whether they are 
transitioning from SPFS, Tier 1 or Tier 2 RDR and preparing Tier 2 SD for the first time; and
(b)
consequently, AASB 1060 may not be the best place for the proposed amendments, given their 
support for additional transitional relief for NFP entities.
BC13
The Board considered this feedback and decided:
(a)
to extend the relief from presenting comparative information for those disclosures not previously 
made to also include transition from Tier 1 to Tier 2 SD. This was because both Tier 1 and Tier 2 
SD are prepared on the same recognition and measurement basis and there would be very few, if 
any, disclosures for which comparative information was not presented. Extending the relief would 
therefore have a limited impact on comparability and would provide consistent optional relief for 
NFP entities transitioning between types of general purpose financial statements;
(b)
not to provide any relief to NFP entities transitioning from SPFS at this time. As noted in paragraphs 
BC7 and BC8, NFP entities are not currently required to transition from SPFS. The Board did 
however reaffirm that it intends to consider specific transition relief for NFP entities, including 
those that may be required to transition from SPFS, as part of its NFP Private Sector Financial 
Reporting Framework project; and
(c)
AASB 1060 remained the most appropriate location for these amendments. Although the optional 
relief in this Standard no longer applies solely to NFP entities transitioning between Tier 2 
frameworks, the Board heard no compelling reasons to relocate the amendments from AASB 1060. 
NFP entities applying the optional relief will be transitioning to Tier 2 SD. Therefore, including 
the relief in the applicable Tier 2 Standard (AASB 1060) remained appropriate.
Effective date and early application
BC14
To ensure consistency between for-profit private sector entities and NFP entities, it was necessary to align the 
effective date of this Standard with the effective date of the equivalent relief available to for-profit private 
sector entities. For this reason, the Board decided that this Standard would be effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 July 2021, with earlier application permitted, provided AASB 1060 is also applied to 
the same period.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
Basis for Conclusions on AASB 2021-6
This Basis for Conclusions accompanies, but is not part of, AASB 1060.  The Basis for Conclusions was originally 
published with AASB 2021-6 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Disclosure of Accounting Policies: 
Tier 2 and Other Australian Accounting Standards.
Introduction
BC1
This Basis for Conclusions summarises the Australian Accounting Standards Board’s considerations in 
reaching the conclusions in this Standard. It sets out the reasons why the Board developed the Standard, the 
approach taken to developing the Standard and the key decisions made. In making decisions, individual Board 
members gave greater weight to some factors than to others. 
Reasons for issuing this Standard
BC2
In March 2021, the Board issued AASB 2021-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – 
Disclosure of Accounting Policies and Definition of Accounting Estimates. This Standard amended:
(a)
AASB 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures, to clarify that information about measurement bases 
for financial instruments is expected to be material to an entity’s financial statements;
(b)
AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements, to require entities to disclose their material 
accounting policy information rather than their significant accounting policies;
(c)
AASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors, to clarify how 
entities should distinguish changes in accounting policies and changes in accounting estimates;
(d)
AASB 134 Interim Financial Reporting, to identify material accounting policy information as a 
component of a complete set of financial statements; and
(e)
AASB Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements, to provide guidance on how to apply 
the concept of materiality to accounting policy disclosures.
BC3
The amendments made by AASB 2021-2 principally affect the disclosure requirements and guidance in some 
Tier 1 Australian Accounting Standards.1 The Board decided it was appropriate to make similar amendments 
to domestic Australian Accounting Standards, including the Tier 2 Standard AASB 1060 General Purpose 
Financial Statements – Simplified Disclosures for For-Profit and Not-for-Profit Tier 2 Entities, to ensure 
there is consistency in the terminology used across Australian Accounting Standards.
Issue of Exposure Draft ED 312
BC4
The Board’s proposals with respect to the amendments finalised in this Standard were exposed for public 
comment in August 2021 through Exposure Draft ED 312 Disclosure of Accounting Policies – Proposed 
Amendments to Tier 2 and Other Australian Accounting Standards.
BC5
The significant issues considered by the Board in developing ED 312 are addressed in the following sections.
Relevance of the amendments to AASB 1060
BC6
The AASB For-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework and the AASB Not-for-Profit Entity Standard-
Setting Framework outline the approach adopted by the Board in considering whether to add to or amend 
disclosure requirements in AASB 1060 when the IASB makes amendments to full IFRS Standards. 
BC7
Applying this approach, ED 312 proposed that in relation to the amendments made by AASB 2021-2 to:
(a)
AASB 101 and AASB 7:
1 
AASB 1053 Application of Tiers of Australian Accounting Standards outlines that Australian Accounting Standards consist of two tiers 
of reporting requirements for preparing general purpose financial statements: 
(a)
Tier 1: Australian Accounting Standards; and 
(b)
Tier 2: Australian Accounting Standards – Simplified Disclosures (for annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2021).
Authorised Version F2025C00209 registered 06/03/2025

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AASB 1060-compiled
87
BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
(i)
where AASB 1060 contains a corresponding paragraph, AASB 1060 should be updated 
in a similar manner. If the corresponding paragraph in AASB 1060 is not updated, 
entities may interpret and apply the requirements of AASB 1060 differently from the 
corresponding requirements in those Standards; and
(ii)
where guidance paragraphs were added to AASB 101, these paragraphs should be added 
to AASB 1060. The intention of these paragraphs is to assist entities in determining 
whether accounting policy information is material to their financial statements. 
Therefore, the Board expected this guidance also to be useful for entities preparing Tier 2 
financial statements. As AASB 101 does not apply directly to entities applying 
AASB 1060 (paragraph 2 of AASB 1060 permits entities to refer to other Standards for 
guidance), the Board considered that a cross-reference to AASB 101 would be unhelpful 
to users of AASB 1060 and took the view that these paragraphs should be added to 
AASB 1060; 
(b)
AASB 134 and AASB Practice Statement 2 – no changes to AASB 1060 were required:
(iii)
AASB 134 applies to the preparation of interim financial reports, whereas AASB 1060 
is intended to be used in the preparation of annual general purpose financial statements. 
Therefore, AASB 1060 does not include any requirements equivalent to those in 
AASB 134; and
(iv)
AASB Practice Statement 2 provides non-mandatory guidance to all entities on making 
materiality judgments when preparing general purpose financial statements in 
accordance with Australian Accounting Standards. Therefore, AASB 1060 does not 
include any requirements equivalent to those in AASB Practice Statement 2; and
(c)
AASB 108 – no changes to AASB 1060 were required. The amended paragraphs in AASB 108 
already apply to entities complying with AASB 1060.
Relevance of the amendments to other Australian Accounting 
Standards
BC8
The Board reviewed the requirements of all domestic Australian Accounting Standards (including 
Interpretations) and Australian-specific requirements in Standards, as identified with the ‘Aus’ prefix. The 
Board noted that two domestic Standards in addition to AASB 1060 contain references to ‘significant 
accounting policies’: AASB 1049 Whole of Government and General Government Sector Financial 
Reporting and AASB 1054 Australian Additional Disclosures. The Board also considered it appropriate to 
propose amendments to these Standards to reflect the updated terminology (ie to require or refer to the 
disclosure of material accounting policy information rather than the disclosure of significant accounting 
policies) for consistency across all Australian Accounting Standards.
Finalisation of ED 312 proposals
BC9
Following the consultation period, and after considering the comments received, the Board decided to proceed 
with issuing this Standard, with minimal changes from the proposals in ED 312. 
Feedback from respondents on ED 312
BC10
The Board received formal comment letters on ED 312 from three stakeholders and verbal feedback from 
another stakeholder. The feedback received indicated that, in general, all respondents were supportive of the 
proposals. However, some respondents provided additional feedback:
(a)
one stakeholder noted that ED 312 proposed adding guidance paragraphs to AASB 1060 (proposed 
paragraphs 95A–95E – corresponding with paragraphs 117A–117E of AASB 101). Although the 
guidance might be helpful to users, the stakeholder was concerned that guidance paragraphs were 
not included in AASB 1060 originally and was also unsure whether all of the guidance in proposed 
paragraphs 95A–95E was necessary. They were also concerned that inclusion of proposed 
paragraphs 95A–95E might create an expectation that guidance paragraphs would be added to 
AASB 1060 routinely in the future; and
(b)
one stakeholder suggested the Board consider whether certain paragraphs in AASB 1060 requiring 
accounting policy information for specific transactions and balances are necessary, as disclosure of 
Authorised Version F2025C00209 registered 06/03/2025

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AASB 1060-compiled
88
BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
this information is already required by AASB 1060 paragraph 95.2 They also suggested that if the 
disclosure requirements were retained, it might be helpful for users of AASB 1060 if the Board 
clarified that the specific disclosures are required only where they are material to the financial 
statements.
BC11
The Board considered the feedback and decided:
(a)
not to add proposed paragraphs 95A–95E to AASB 1060. When developing AASB 1060, the Board 
was aware that replacing certain Standards with sections in AASB 1060 also removed some of the 
guidance included in those Standards, where such guidance was also not included in the 
International Financial Reporting Standard for Small and Medium-sized Entities (IFRS for SMEs 
Standard). However, for the sake of maintaining the simplicity of the disclosure requirements in 
AASB 1060, the Board considered this to be preferable to considering on a case-by-case basis 
which guidance should be included and which could be omitted.3 Whilst the Board was unable to 
follow the IASB approach in this case as the IFRS for SMEs Standard was last updated in 2015, on 
balance the Board considered that including the proposed guidance paragraphs in AASB 1060 was 
not necessary. The Board noted that AASB 1060 paragraph 2 permits an entity applying 
AASB 1060 to refer to other Australian Accounting Standards (including AASB 101) for guidance 
where necessary; and
(a)
to clarify that the accounting policy disclosure requirements in AASB 1060 for specific transactions 
or balances apply only where the accounting policy information is material to the financial 
statements (i.e. the same basis as the general requirement to disclose accounting policy information 
in AASB 1060 paragraph 95).  The Board considered that the clarification would be helpful to users 
of AASB 1060.
Effective date and early application 
BC12
To ensure consistency between the amendments in this Standard and the amendments made in AASB 2021-2, 
the Board decided that this Standard would be effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 
2023, with earlier application permitted.
2 
For example, AASB 1060 paragraphs 123, 125, 129, 160, 163 and 221 require disclosure of accounting policy information for specific 
transactions and balances.

Basis for Conclusions on AASB 2023-3
This Basis for Conclusions accompanies, but is not part of, AASB 1060.  The Basis for Conclusions was originally 
published with AASB 2023-3 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Disclosure of Non-current Liabilities 
with Covenants: Tier 2.
Introduction
BC1
This Basis for Conclusions summarises the Australian Accounting Standards Board’s considerations in 
reaching the conclusions in this Standard. It sets out the reasons why the Board developed the Standard, the 
approach taken to developing the Standard and the bases for the key decisions made. In making decisions, 
individual Board members gave greater weight to some factors than to others.
Reasons for proposing these amendments
BC2
The Board issued AASB 2020-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Classification of 
Liabilities as Current or Non-Current in March 2020 and AASB 2022-6 Amendments to Australian 
Accounting Standards – Non-current Liabilities with Covenants in December 2022. These Standards amended 
AASB 101 Presentation of Financial Statements to improve the information an entity provides in its financial 
statements about liabilities arising from loan arrangements for which the entity’s right to defer settlement of 
those liabilities for at least twelve months after the reporting period is subject to the entity complying with 
conditions specified in the loan arrangement (often referred to as ‘covenants’). AASB 2022-6 also amended 
an example in AASB Practice Statement 2 Making Materiality Judgements regarding assessing whether 
information about covenants is material for disclosure.
BC3
The amendments made by AASB 2020-1 and AASB 2022-6 principally affect the classification and 
disclosure of current and non-current liabilities for entities applying Tier 1 reporting requirements.1 It is 
appropriate for the Board to consider making similar amendments to the Tier 2 Standard AASB 1060 General 
Purpose Financial Statements – Simplified Disclosures for For-Profit and Not-for-Profit Tier 2 Entities to 
ensure consistency in the terminology and presentation requirements across Australian Accounting Standards.
Issue of Exposure Draft ED 323
BC4
The Board’s proposals with respect to the amendments finalised in this Standard were exposed for public 
comment in March 2023 through Exposure Draft ED 323 Disclosure of Non-current Liabilities with 
Covenants – Proposed Amendments to Tier 2.
BC5
The significant issues considered by the Board in developing ED 323 are addressed in the following section.
Relevance of the amendments to AASB 1060
BC6
The AASB For-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework and the AASB Not-for-Profit Entity Standard-
Setting Framework outline the approach adopted by the Board for considering whether to add to or amend 
disclosure requirements in AASB 1060 when the IASB makes amendments to full IFRS Standards.
BC7
Applying this approach, ED 323 proposed that in relation to the amendments made by AASB 2020-1 and 
AASB 2022-6 to AASB 101:
(a)
where AASB 1060 contains a corresponding paragraph, AASB 1060 should be updated in a similar 
manner. If the corresponding paragraph in AASB 1060 (paragraph 40) is not updated, entities may 
interpret and apply the requirements of AASB 1060 differently from the corresponding 
requirements in AASB 101;
(b)
AASB 1060 should be updated in relation to the new disclosure requirements added to AASB 101 
if the disclosure is of particular relevance in the Australian environment or addresses a matter of 
public policy since the amendments to AASB 101 do not introduce significant recognition and 
1 
AASB 1053 Application of Tiers of Australian Accounting Standards outlines that Australian Accounting Standards consist of two tiers 
of reporting requirements for preparing general purpose financial statements: 
(a)
Tier 1: Australian Accounting Standards; and 
(b)
Tier 2: Australian Accounting Standards – Simplified Disclosures.

measurement differences. The rationale for proposing to add paragraph 47A to AASB 1060 is 
further detailed in paragraph BC8; and
(c)
where guidance paragraphs were added to AASB 101, these paragraphs should not be added to 
AASB 1060. When developing AASB 1060, the Board was aware that replacing certain Standards 
with sections in AASB 1060 also removed some of the guidance included in those Standards, where 
such guidance was also not included in the International Financial Reporting Standard for Small 
and Medium-sized Entities (IFRS for SMEs Standard). However, to maintain the simplicity of the 
disclosure requirements in AASB 1060, the Board considered this preferable to considering on a 
case-by-case basis which guidance should be included and which could be omitted.2 Although the 
Board was unable to follow that approach in this case as the IFRS for SMEs Standard was last 
updated by the IASB in 2015, prior to the 2020 and 2022 amendments, on balance the Board 
considered that including the additional guidance paragraphs in AASB 1060 was not necessary. 
The Board noted that AASB 1060 paragraph 2 permits an entity applying AASB 1060 to refer to 
the guidance in other Australian Accounting Standards (including AASB 101) when helpful.
BC8
When applying the approach outlined in paragraph BC7(b) to proposed paragraph 47A (corresponding to 
AASB 101 paragraph 76ZA(a)), the Board considered that the disclosures would provide useful information 
to the users of Tier 2 financial statements because it would allow them to understand the nature of the entity’s 
covenants and the risk that a liability classified as non-current could nonetheless be repayable within twelve 
months. The Board considers that users of the financial statements of Tier 2 entities are particularly interested 
in information about an entity’s short-term cash flows and obligations, commitments, or contingencies, 
whether or not recognised as liabilities, and liquidity and solvency.3
BC9
No changes to AASB 1060 were proposed in relation to the amendments made to AASB Practice Statement 2. 
This is because AASB Practice Statement 2 provides non-mandatory guidance to all entities on making 
materiality judgements when preparing general purpose financial statements in accordance with Australian 
Accounting Standards. AASB 1060 does not include any guidance corresponding explicitly with that in 
AASB Practice Statement 2.
Finalisation of ED 323 proposals
BC10
Following the consultation period, and after considering the comments received, the Board decided to proceed 
with issuing this Standard, with minimal changes from the proposals in ED 323.
Feedback from respondents on ED 323
BC11
The Board received four formal comment letters on ED 323 and informal feedback from targeted outreach 
activities. The feedback received indicated that, in general, all respondents were supportive of the proposals. 
However, some respondents provided additional feedback:
(a)
one stakeholder suggested the Board consider including in AASB 1060 certain guidance paragraphs 
that had been added to AASB 101. In their view, paragraphs 72B and 75A of AASB 101 provide 
the most useful guidance for preparers when determining whether a liability is current or non-
current. The stakeholder was concerned that if these guidance paragraphs were not included in 
AASB 1060, Tier 2 entities might not be aware of the useful guidance or would have to refer to 
AASB 101 for the guidance; and
(b)
one stakeholder suggested the Board reconsider the proposed amendments to paragraph 40(d) and 
relocate the statement about counterparty equity conversion options to a separate paragraph. In their 
view, the amendment proposed to paragraph 40(d) in ED 323 implied that the statement is relevant 
to paragraph 40(d) but not to paragraphs 40(a) and 40(c). They considered that the amendment 
proposed in ED 323 would be inconsistent with the amendments made to AASB 101, which 
relocated the statement about counterparty conversion options to a separate paragraph, paragraph 
76B.
BC12
The Board considered the feedback and decided:
(a)
not to add the guidance contained in paragraphs 72B and 75A of AASB 101 to AASB 1060. The 
Board confirmed its view that guidance paragraphs added to AASB 101 should not be added to 
AASB 1060; and
2 
AASB 1060 paragraph BC55.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
Basis for Conclusions on AASB 2023-4
This Basis for Conclusions accompanies, but is not part of, AASB 1060.  The Basis for Conclusions was originally 
published with AASB 2023-4 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – International Tax Reform – Pillar Two 
Model Rules: Tier 2 Disclosures.
Introduction
BC1
This Basis for Conclusions summarises the Australian Accounting Standards Board’s considerations in 
reaching the conclusions in this Standard.  It sets out the reasons why the Board developed the Standard, the 
approach taken to developing the Standard and the bases for the key decisions made.  In making decisions, 
individual Board members gave greater weight to some factors than to others.
Background
Pillar Two model rules
BC2
In October 2021 more than 135 jurisdictions agreed to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and 
Development (OECD)/G20 Inclusive Framework on Base Erosion and Profit Shifting’s Statement on a Two-
Pillar Solution to Address the Tax Challenges Arising from the Digitalisation of the Economy.  Since then, the 
OECD has published model rules and other documents related to the second pillar of this solution (the Pillar 
Two model rules).  The Pillar Two model rules provide a template that jurisdictions can translate into domestic 
tax law and implement as part of an agreed common approach.
BC3
The model rules: 
(a)
aim to ensure that large multinational groups pay a minimum amount of tax on income arising in 
each jurisdiction in which they operate; 
(b)
would achieve that aim by applying a system of top-up taxes that results in the total amount of taxes 
payable on “excess profit” in each jurisdiction representing at least the minimum rate of 15%; and
(c)
typically require the ultimate parent entity of a group to pay top-up tax – in the jurisdiction in which 
it is domiciled – on profits of its subsidiaries that are taxed below 15%.
BC4
The rules are aimed at multinational groups with revenue in their consolidated financial statements exceeding 
€750 million in at least two of the four preceding fiscal years.  The rules specify inclusion thresholds for some 
jurisdictions and exclude some types of entities from their scope.
Potential implications for income tax accounting
BC5
In response to stakeholder concerns about the implications for income tax accounting, in June 2023 the Board 
issued AASB 2023-2 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – International Tax Reform – Pillar 
Two Model Rules, which amended AASB 112 Income Taxes to introduce:
(a)
a mandatory temporary exception to accounting for deferred taxes arising from the implementation 
of the Pillar Two model rules published by the OECD; and
(b)
targeted disclosure requirements to help financial statement users better understand an entity’s 
exposure to income taxes arising from the reform, particularly in periods before legislation 
implementing the rules is in effect.
BC6
The mandatory temporary exception and related disclosures noted in paragraph BC5 apply to both Tier 1 and 
Tier 2 entities.1 
BC7
However, to ensure Tier 2 entities are required to comply with disclosure requirements set out in AASB 1060 
rather than the new requirements in AASB 112, the Board proposed to amend Appendix A of AASB 112 to 
1 
AASB 1053 Application of Tiers of Australian Accounting Standards outlines that Australian Accounting Standards consist of two tiers 
of reporting requirements for preparing general purpose financial statements:
(a)
Tier 1: Australian Accounting Standards; and 
(b)
Tier 2: Australian Accounting Standards – Simplified Disclosures.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
extend the exemption from compliance with the disclosure requirements of AASB 112 for entities applying 
AASB 1060 to include the disclosure requirements added to AASB 112 by AASB 2023-2.
BC8
In considering whether to propose amendments to AASB 1060 to require targeted disclosures by Tier 2 
entities, the Board considered that the Pillar Two model rules could have a material effect on the financial 
statements of Tier 2 entities.  For example, some subsidiaries of large multinational groups may be affected 
by Pillar Two legislation.2
Issue of Exposure Draft ED 325
BC9
The Board’s proposals with respect to the amendments finalised in this Standard were exposed for public 
comment in July 2023 through Exposure Draft ED 325 International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules: 
Tier 2 Disclosures.
BC10
The significant issues considered by the Board in developing ED 325 are addressed in the following section.
Relevance of the amendments to AASB 1060
BC11
The AASB For-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework and the AASB Not-For-Profit Entity Standard-
Setting Framework outline the approach adopted by the Board for considering whether to add to or amend 
disclosure requirements in AASB 1060 when the IASB makes amendments to full IFRS Standards.
BC12
The standard-setting frameworks first consider whether the amendments introduce a significant recognition 
and measurement difference between full IFRS Standards and the IFRS for SMEs Standard.  If they don’t, the 
standard-setting frameworks state that no further action is required unless:
(a)
the disclosures address a matter of public policy; 
(b)
the disclosures are of particular relevance in the Australian environment; or 
(c)
the amendments clarify or reduce existing disclosure requirements in full IFRS Standards.
BC13
In addition to the principles in the standard-setting frameworks, the Board acknowledged when finalising 
AASB 1060 that a review of the disclosures in AASB 1060 would need to take place any time the IFRS for 
SMEs Standard is updated (paragraph BC96).
BC14
Although there will be no recognition and measurement differences between full IFRS Standards and the IFRS 
for SMEs Accounting Standard or between Tier 1 and Tier 2 entities in Australia in respect of Pillar Two 
income taxes, the Board considers that Tier 2 entities applying the mandatory temporary exception should be 
required to include some disclosures in their financial statements to help users understand the effect of Pillar 
Two legislation on the financial statements. 
BC15
In addition, the Board noted that the IASB proposed amendments to the IFRS for SMEs Standard, issuing 
Exposure Draft IASB/ED/2023/3 International Tax Reform – Pillar Two Model Rules – Proposed 
amendments to the IFRS for SMEs Standard in June 2023.  IASB/ED/2023/3 proposes amendments to the 
IFRS for SMEs Standard that would:
(a)
introduce a temporary exception to accounting for deferred taxes arising from the implementation 
of the Pillar Two model rules;
(b)
introduce targeted disclosure requirements in periods when Pillar Two legislation is in effect; and
(c)
clarify that ‘other events’ in the disclosure objective for income tax include enacted or substantively 
enacted Pillar Two legislation.
BC16
Therefore, the Board decided to propose amendments to AASB 1060 to require Tier 2 entities applying the 
temporary exception to include targeted disclosures in their financial statements.
Disclosures
BC17
As noted in paragraph BC6, a Tier 2 entity is required to apply the mandatory temporary exception to 
accounting for deferred taxes arising from the implementation of the Pillar Two model rules in AASB 112.  
To make the application of the exception transparent, the Board proposed requiring Tier 2 entities applying 
the temporary exception to disclose that fact.
2 
‘Pillar Two legislation’ refers to tax law enacted or substantively enacted to implement the Pillar Two model rules published by the 
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), including tax law that implements qualified domestic minimum top-
up taxes described in those rules. Income taxes arising from Pillar Two legislation are hereafter referred to as ‘Pillar Two income taxes’.

AASB 1060
94
BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
BC18
In addition, consistent with the IASB’s proposed approach to amending the IFRS for SMEs Standard, the 
Board decided:
(a)
in relation to periods before relevant Pillar Two legislation is in effect, not to propose specific 
disclosure requirements; and
(b)
in relation to periods when relevant legislation is in effect, to propose requiring an entity to disclose 
its current tax expense (income) related to Pillar Two income taxes.
BC19
In making these decisions, the Board considered that:
(a)
it was not necessary to add a new disclosure requirement for periods before relevant Pillar Two 
legislation is in effect because the existing disclosure requirement in paragraph 176 would be 
expected to result in Tier 2 entities affected by Pillar Two legislation providing some information 
about the nature and financial effect of enacted or substantively enacted Pillar Two legislation 
before it applies.  However, the Board decided to propose clarifying that the reference in paragraph 
176 to ‘other events’ includes enacted or substantively enacted Pillar Two legislation; and
(b)
requiring a Tier 2 entity to disclose its current tax expense (income) related to Pillar Two income 
taxes when relevant legislation is in effect would help users of the financial statements understand 
the magnitude of Pillar Two income taxes relative to the entity’s overall tax expense (income).  The 
Board considered this disclosure would not be costly to prepare because a Tier 2 entity would 
already be required in these circumstances to recognise current tax related to Pillar Two income 
taxes.
Finalisation of ED 325 proposals
BC20
Following the consultation period, and after considering the comments received, the Board decided to proceed 
with issuing this Standard, with minimal changes from the proposals in ED 325.
Feedback from respondents on ED 325
BC21
The Board received two formal comment letters on ED 325.  The feedback received indicated that, in general, 
both stakeholders were supportive of the proposals.  However, one stakeholder provided additional feedback.
BC22
The stakeholder suggested that the proposed clarification to paragraph 176 was not necessary because it is 
already understood that the “transactions and other events” referred to in paragraph 176 include the enactment 
or substantive enactment of tax rates and laws.  They also suggested that if the Board is concerned that this 
may not be the case, the clarification should be worded more broadly than specifically referring to Pillar Two 
legislation, or else the Board could consider clarifying this in the Basis for Conclusions.
BC23
The Board considered this feedback, along with feedback received by the IASB on IASB/ED/2023/3 and 
decided to generalise the wording of the clarification to paragraph 176 and refer to the Pillar Two legislation 
as an example.
Effective date
BC24
The Board decided that the amendments should be made effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2023 that end on or after 30 September 2023, with earlier application permitted, as proposed in 
ED 325.  This is consistent with the effective date of AASB 2023-2 for most entities.
BC25
The Board noted the comment from one of the respondents to ED 325 that the proposed effective date could 
make Tier 2 entities unsure about the application of the amendments to certain periods, such as the 2022/23 
financial year.  The Board confirmed the proposed two-pronged effective date, which is required in this case 
to avoid any mandatory retrospective application to reporting periods that have ended prior to the Board 
making the Standard.  The Board noted that an entity could elect to apply the amendments before their 
mandatory application date, for example to the 2022/23 financial year or any period ending before 30 
September 2023.

BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
Basis for Conclusions on AASB 2024-1
This Basis for Conclusions accompanies, but is not part of, AASB 1060.  The Basis for Conclusions was originally 
published with AASB 2024-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Supplier Finance Arrangements: 
Tier 2 Disclosures.
Introduction
BC1
This Basis for Conclusions summarises the Australian Accounting Standards Board’s considerations in 
reaching the conclusions in this Standard. It sets out the reasons why the Board developed the Standard, the 
approach taken to developing the Standard and the bases for the key decisions made. In making decisions, 
individual Board members gave greater weight to some factors than to others.
Background
Tier 1 amendments
BC2
In June 2023, the AASB issued AASB 2023-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Supplier 
Finance Arrangements. The Standard amends AASB 107 Statement of Cash Flows and AASB 7 Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures to require an entity to provide additional disclosures about its supplier finance 
arrangements.
BC3
The additional information will enable users of financial statements to assess how supplier finance 
arrangements affect an entity’s liabilities, cash flows and exposure to liquidity risk. The amendments require 
an entity to disclose the terms and conditions of the arrangements, the carrying amount of the liabilities that 
are part of the arrangements, the carrying amounts of those liabilities for which the suppliers have already 
received payment from the finance providers, the range of payment due dates and the effect of non-cash 
changes.
BC4
These amendments arose from the issuance of International Financial Reporting Standard Supplier Finance 
Arrangements (Amendments to IAS 7 Statement of Cash Flows and IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: 
Disclosures) by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) in May 2023.
BC5
The amendments made by AASB 2023-1 introduced disclosure requirements for entities applying Tier 1 
reporting requirements. Therefore, it was appropriate for the Board to consider whether similar amendments 
to the Tier 2 Standard AASB 1060 General Purpose Financial Statements – Simplified Disclosures for For-
Profit and Not-for-Profit Tier 2 Entities were required.
Issue of Exposure Draft ED 328
BC6
The Board’s proposals with respect to the amendments finalised in this Standard were exposed for public 
comment in December 2023 through Exposure Draft ED 328 Supplier Finance Arrangements: Tier 2 
Disclosures.
BC7
The significant issues considered by the Board in developing ED 328 are addressed in the following section.
Relevance of the amendments to AASB 1060
BC8
The AASB For-Profit Entity Standard-Setting Framework and the AASB Not-For-Profit Entity Standard-
Setting Framework outline the approach adopted by the Board for considering whether to add to or amend 
disclosure requirements in AASB 1060 when the IASB makes amendments to full IFRS Standards.
BC9
The standard-setting frameworks first consider whether the amendments introduce a significant recognition 
and measurement difference between full IFRS Standards and the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard. If 
they do not, the standard-setting frameworks state that no further action is required unless:
(a)
the disclosures address a matter of public policy;
(b)
the disclosures are of particular relevance in the Australian environment; or 
(c)
the amendments clarify or reduce existing disclosure requirements in full IFRS Standards.
Authorised Version F2025C00209 registered 06/03/2025

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
AASB 1060
96
BASIS FOR CONCLUSIONS
BC10
The Board noted that the disclosure requirements were added to IFRS Standards to address users’ need for 
information relating to an entity’s liquidity position and cash flow. The feedback from Australian users 
reinforced the need for these disclosures.
BC11
Although the Board had not received any feedback on whether these disclosures were of similar importance 
to users of Tier 2 financial statements, in deciding whether to propose adding disclosures about supplier 
finance arrangements to AASB 1060 the Board considered the principles it used when developing AASB 1060 
and subsequently when considering whether to add to or amend the disclosure requirements.
BC12
When developing and considering amendments to AASB 1060, the Board considers that information about 
short-term cash flows and obligations, commitments or contingencies, liquidity and solvency, measurement 
uncertainties, accounting policy choices and disaggregation of amounts presented in the financial statements 
would be particularly important to the users of Tier 2 financial statements.
BC13
Therefore, the Board proposed amendments to AASB 1060 to require Tier 2 entities to disclose information 
relating to their supplier finance arrangements. The amendments would require a Tier 2 entity to include in its 
financial statements the same specific disclosures that AASB 2023-1 requires in the financial statements of 
entities applying Tier 1 reporting requirements. The Board considered the proposed disclosures would provide 
additional information about the cash flows, liquidity and solvency of Tier 2 entities.
Finalisation of ED 328 proposals
BC14
Following the consultation period and after considering the comments received, the Board decided to proceed 
with issuing this Standard, with minimal changes from the proposals in ED 328. The Board noted the 
disclosures would need to be made only where material to the entity.
Feedback from respondents on ED 328 and international alignment
BC15
The Board received one formal comment letter on ED 328. The feedback received indicated that, in general, 
the stakeholder was supportive of the proposals. However, the stakeholder provided additional feedback.
BC16
The stakeholder suggested that the disclosure objective in proposed paragraph 119A in ED 328 was 
unnecessary. The stakeholder observed that the IASB has not generally included disclosure objectives in the 
IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard and, therefore, the Board generally has also not previously included 
disclosure objectives in AASB 1060. It also observed that not including disclosure objectives is consistent 
with the approach proposed by the IASB in its Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures project.
BC17
The Board noted that the IASB has tentatively decided not to include the disclosure objective in its proposed 
amendments to add supplier finance arrangement disclosures to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard.
BC18
The Board considered this feedback and decided that, for consistency with the IASB’s tentative approach, it 
would not add the disclosure objective proposed in ED 328 to this Standard. As AASB 1060 was developed 
based on the requirements in the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard, the Board considered that following 
the IASB’s tentative approach was appropriate. However, the Board noted its intention to monitor future IASB 
decisions about supplier finance arrangement disclosures in the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard and 
consider whether further amendments are required to AASB 1060 at that time.
BC19
In considering the IASB’s tentative approach and proposed amendments to the IFRS for SMEs Accounting 
Standard and the forthcoming Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures Standard, the Board 
observed that the IASB is not proposing to include:
(a)
transition relief in the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard. The IASB does not consider transition 
relief necessary as it expects to issue the amendments at least two years before their application 
date. (The IASB has not yet considered whether transition relief may be required in the Subsidiaries 
without Public Accountability: Disclosures Standard.) The Board, however, considered that it is 
necessary to add transition relief to AASB 1060 given the short time frame between the issue of 
these amendments and their application date. Consequently, the transition reliefs proposed in 
ED 328 are included in paragraph 119C of this Standard; and
(b)
the final sentence in paragraph 119A of this Standard in the IFRS for SMEs Accounting Standard. 
However, the IASB has tentatively decided to include this sentence in proposed amendments to the 
Subsidiaries without Public Accountability: Disclosures Standard. The Board considered the 
additional information about some finance arrangements that are outside the scope of supplier 
finance arrangements is useful for Tier 2 entities and decided to retain this information.

The Board decided that the amendments should be made effective for annual periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2024 that end on or after 30 June 2024, with earlier application permitted, as proposed in ED 328. 
This is consistent with the effective date of AASB 2023-1 for most Tier 1 entities.
