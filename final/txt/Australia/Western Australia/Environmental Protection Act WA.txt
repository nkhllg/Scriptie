Object and principles of Act 
 
 
The object of this Act is to protect the environment of the State, 
having regard to the following principles — 
Table 
1. 
The precautionary principle 
 
Where there are threats of serious or irreversible 
damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not 
be used as a reason for postponing measures to 
prevent environmental degradation.

Official Version 
page 23 
[PCO 09-w0-01] 
Published on www.legislation.wa.gov.au 
 
In the application of the precautionary principle, 
decisions should be guided by — 
 
(a) 
careful evaluation to avoid, where practicable, 
serious or irreversible damage to the 
environment; and 
 
(b) an assessment of the risk-weighted 
consequences of various options. 
2. 
The principle of intergenerational equity 
 
The present generation should ensure that the 
health, diversity and productivity of the 
environment is maintained or enhanced for the 
benefit of future generations. 
3. 
The principle of the conservation of biological 
diversity and ecological integrity 
 
Conservation of biological diversity and ecological 
integrity should be a fundamental consideration. 
4. 
Principles relating to improved valuation, pricing 
and incentive mechanisms 
 
(1) Environmental factors should be included in 
the valuation of assets and services. 
 
(2) The polluter pays principle — those who 
generate pollution and waste should bear the 
cost of containment, avoidance or abatement.

(3) The users of goods and services should pay 
prices based on the full life cycle costs of 
providing goods and services, including the 
use of natural resources and assets and the 
ultimate disposal of any wastes. 
 
(4) Environmental goals, having been established, 
should be pursued in the most cost effective 
way, by establishing incentive structures, 
including market mechanisms, which enable 
those best placed to maximise benefits and/or 
minimise costs to develop their own solutions 
and responses to environmental problems. 
5. 
The principle of waste minimisation 
 
All reasonable and practicable measures should be 
taken to minimise the generation of waste and its 
discharge into the environment.

the Authority under section 38 in place of the terminated 
proposal.

under section 31(d) of a new approved policy or as a 
result of an approved policy as amended being

Some prior convictions and payments of modified penalties 
to be disregarded for s. 99K(3) 
 
 
For the purposes of section 99K(3), a prior conviction or 
payment of a modified penalty in respect of an alleged offence 
is not to be taken into account for the purposes of determining 
whether the alleged offender has previously been convicted of 
an offence or has previously paid a modified penalty notice 
unless — 
 
(a) 
the prior conviction was recorded within the period of 
5 years immediately prior to the giving of an 
infringement notice in respect of the present alleged 
offence; or 
 
(b) 
the modified penalty was paid in respect of the prior 
alleged offence within the period of 5 years immediately 
prior to the giving of an infringement notice in respect of 
the present alleged offence. 
 
[Section 99L inserted: No. 14 of 1998 s. 14.] 
99M. 
Extending time to pay modified penalty 
 
 
A designated person may, in a particular case, extend the period 
of 28 days within which the modified penalty may be paid and 
the extension may be allowed whether or not the period of 
28 days has elapsed. 
 
[Section 99M inserted: No. 14 of 1998 s. 14.] 
99N. 
Withdrawing infringement notice

Within one year after the notice was given a designated person 
may, whether or not the modified penalty has been paid, 
withdraw an infringement notice by sending to the alleged 
offender a notice in the prescribed form stating that the 
infringement notice has been withdrawn. 
 
(2) 
If an infringement notice is withdrawn after the modified 
penalty has been paid, the amount is to be refunded.

Subsection (2) applies if the modified penalty specified in an

time as is allowed and the notice has not been withdrawn.

otherwise, to be dealt with as if it were a fine imposed

(2) 
In subsections (3) to (5) —

by this Act; 
 
transitional period means the period beginning on 26 June 2002

contravention of — 
 
(i)
