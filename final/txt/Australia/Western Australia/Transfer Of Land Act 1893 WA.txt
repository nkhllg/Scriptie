described in title deeds or certificate 
 
 
On any application to bring land under this Act by a description 
different from that in the muniments of title or for the 
amendment of a certificate or for the amendment or replacement 
of a relevant graphic the Commissioner may grant the same as 
to the land in the occupation of the applicant if the discrepancy 
between the land as occupied and as described in the muniments 
or certificate of title or relevant graphic shall appear to be due to 
the inaccuracy of any survey or plan or description on the sale 
of the land by the Crown or on any subsequent dealing 
therewith or to any discrepancy between the actual 
measurements or bearings at any time made or marked on the 
ground and those represented or mentioned in any plan or

(1) 
While any caveat shall remain in force prohibiting any 
registration or dealing the Registrar shall not enter in the 
Register any change in the proprietorship of or any transfer or 
other instrument purporting to transfer or otherwise deal with or 
affect the estate or interest in respect to which such caveat may 
be lodged unless — 
 
(a) 
subsection (2) applies; or 
 
(b) 
the instrument is a property (seizure and sale) order 
within the meaning given in section 133; or 
 
(c) 
the instrument is a sheriff’s dealing (within the meaning 
given in section 133) and the matter to which the caveat 
relates does not, under section 133(7), prevail against 
the dealing; or 
 
(d) 
section 142 applies. 
 
(2) 
Where an instrument is presented for registration and a caveat is 
lodged after the time of the presentation of the instrument, the 
caveat shall not have the effect of preventing registration of the 
instrument but the caveat shall take effect as if lodged after 
registration of the instrument.

The survey boundaries of any Crown section location allotment 
or other parcel of land marked on the ground at the time of the 
Crown Survey thereof and shown by survey posts pegs trenches 
or other survey marks shall as to any such parcel of land 
heretofore or hereafter granted, transferred in fee simple or 
demised by the Crown be and be deemed to have been the true 
boundaries of such parcel of land whether such boundaries upon 
admeasurement are or are not found to be of the same 
dimensions or to include the same area as the boundaries or 
description of such parcel given in the Crown grant or 
certificate of title or on a relevant graphic but it shall be lawful 
for an authorised land officer to alter the survey boundaries 
marked upon the ground as aforesaid so that however such 
alteration does not interfere with any improvements which may 
have been in good faith effected by the lessee, grantee or 
transferee from the Crown.

Every Crown grant or transfer of Crown land in fee simple

land included within the survey boundaries of such parcel of 
land marked on the ground in the Crown survey thereof 
notwithstanding any discrepancy between the dimensions of 
such survey boundaries or the area they include and the 
dimensions or area expressed in such grant or in the relevant

Where a Crown section has been subdivided by the Crown into

measurements in the original Crown survey the area of the 
section as marked on the ground by the survey boundaries 
exceeds the sum of the areas of all the allotments or portions as 
shown by any plan or description used at the Crown sale or as 
deducible from any Crown grant of any such allotment or 
portion the total excess of area of the section shall be deemed 
originally distributable amongst the allotments or portions 
equally; and every Crown grant or transfer of Crown land in fee 
simple purporting to be a grant or transfer of one of such 
allotments or portions shall where the original subdivisional 
survey boundaries thereof do not exist or if not inconsistent with 
such boundaries where they do exist be construed to be a grant 
of such aliquot part of the total area included within the survey

(where the land is under The Transfer of Land Act 1874, or is 
under or is proposed to be brought under the operation of this 
Act) in any proceeding or application in which the boundaries 
of such parcel of land have to be determined that certain 
buildings fences walls or other improvements of a permanent 
nature or a succession of such improvements — 
 
(a) 
have ever since the removal or obliteration of such 
survey marks indicated or agreed in position with the 
boundaries originally marked on the ground by the 
survey marks so removed or obliterated; or 
 
(b)

been used and regarded by the owner or occupier or 
successive owners or occupiers of such parcel of land as 
marking or agreeing in position with the boundaries of 
the parcel of land comprised in the document of title 
under or by virtue of which such land is or has been 
occupied, 
 
 
such proofs as aforesaid shall be deemed and received as 
sufficient evidence of the true positions of the original survey 
boundaries of such parcel of land.
