Renewal of registration 
 (1A) 
A statement cannot be lodged under subsection (1) in respect of 
the registration of a business name that expires on or after the 
change-over day. 
 (1B) 
If the registration of a business name expires before the 
change-over day, the fact that the period of one month after the 
expiry of the registration ends on or after the change-over day 
does not prevent a statement being lodged under subsection (1) 
at any time within that period. 
 
(1) 
The registration of a business name remains in force for a period 
of 3 years, but the registration may from time to time be 
renewed by lodging with the Commissioner, at any time within 
the period of one month before or after the expiry of the 
registration or within such further time as the Commissioner 
allows, a statement in the prescribed form, signed by the person 
or one of the persons in relation to whom the name is registered, 
together with the prescribed fee. 
 (1a) 
If, and to the extent that, the fee referred to in subsection (1) is a 
tax, this subsection imposes the tax. 
 (2A) 
Subsection (2B) applies if —  
 
(a) 
a statement is lodged under subsection (1), but not 
finally dealt with by the Commissioner, before the 
change-over day; or 
 
(b) 
a statement is lodged under subsection (1) on or after the 
change-over day. 
 (2B) 
The Commissioner may, on or after the change-over day, decide 
whether, had the statement been lodged and finally dealt with 
before the change-over day, the Commissioner would have 
renewed the registration of the business name under 
subsection (1). 
 
(2) 
If a statement lodged under subsection (1) is finally dealt with 
by the Commissioner before the change-over day, the renewal 
of a registration shall be deemed to have been effected for a

further period of 3 years as from the day on which the previous 
registration expires or has expired, as the case may be. 
 (3A) 
If a statement lodged under subsection (1) is dealt with in 
accordance with subsection (2B), the previous registration of the 
business name to which the statement relates is to be taken to 
have remained in force in respect of the period between when 
the previous registration expired and the change-over day. 
 
(3) 
In respect of the registration of a business name that expires 
before the change-over day, the Commissioner shall before or 
after the expiration of the registration of the business name, but 
not earlier than one month before the expiration (and in any 
case, before the change-over day), send by post to the person or 
persons in relation to whom the business name is or was 
registered, at the place shown in the register as the place where 
business is carried on under that name, a notice of the date on 
which the registration is due to expire or has expired, as the case 
may be. 
 
(4) 
Where the registration of a business name has expired the 
Commissioner shall not, except where he is of the opinion that 
owing to the nature of the business and the locality in which it is 
carried on the public are not likely to be misled, accept for 
registration from any person or persons other than the person or 
persons in relation to whom the business name was registered 
any business name that is identical with that business name or 
that, in the opinion of the Commissioner, so nearly resembles it 
as to be calculated to deceive, until the expiration of one month 
after the sending of the notice referred to in subsection (3). 
 
(5) 
Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1), the following 
provisions apply in relation to a business name that is deemed to 
be registered under this Act by virtue of being registered or 
having been deemed to have been registered under the repealed 
Act — 
 
(a) 
the registration of the business name remains in force, 
subject to this Act, until a date fixed by the 
Commissioner; and

notice in writing of the date so fixed shall be posted by

business names, cessation of business etc. 
 (1A) 
Except as provided in subsection (1B), a statement cannot be 
lodged under this section on or after the change-over day.

lodged with the Commissioner insufficient to disclose

business is carried on under that name or in the address
