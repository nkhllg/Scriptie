EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•
The Australian War Memorial is currently developing the Australian War Memorial Heritage 
Register in conjunction with Australian War Memorial’s existing collection management 
database (MICA). The Register is a list of places and place elements which have been identified 
as having Commonwealth Heritage value.
•
Navin Officer Heritage Consultants Pty Ltd was commissioned by Godden Mackay Logan to 
undertake an indigenous cultural heritage assessment of the Campbell and Mitchell precincts of 
the Australian War Memorial. The study included literature review, consultation with 
representative local Aboriginal groups and field surveys within the Campbell and Mitchell 
Precincts.
•
The main objectives of this heritage study were to:

Identify Aboriginal heritage within the study areas;

Assess the significance of Aboriginal heritage sites within the study areas;

Identify those sites that warrant permanent conservation and are a permanent constraint 
to disturbance within the study areas;

Identify areas where further information is required to make an assessment on the 
heritage value of a site; and

Provide management recommendations to achieve protection for those sites that warrant 
it.
•
The study determined that:

No Aboriginal sites have been previously identified within the study areas;

No Aboriginal sites or areas of archaeological potential/sensitivity were identified in the 
Australian War Memorial Mitchell Precinct study area in the course of the current 
investigation. There are no indigenous heritage assets or constraints relating to the 
Australian War Memorial Mitchell Precinct; and

One Aboriginal site, isolated find, AWM1, was identified in the Australian War Memorial 
Campbell Precinct study area in the course of the current investigation. The site has low 
archaeological values, but is valued by the local Aboriginal community and as such it 
meets Criterion (i) of the Commonwealth Heritage Listing criteria.
•
It is recommended that:

Site AWM1 be listed on the Australian War Memorial Heritage Register and ACT Heritage 
Register; and

Impact to site AWM1 should be avoided, if disturbance is anticipated potential activities 
around the periphery of the site should be managed and the site fenced where appropriate 
to demarcate site boundary and to control access.

1. INTRODUCTION
The Australian War Memorial (AWM) is currently developing the Australian War Memorial Heritage 
Register in conjunction with Australian War Memorial’s existing collection management database 
(MICA). The Register is a list of places and place elements which have been identified as having 
Commonwealth Heritage value.
Godden Mackay Logan (GML) has been engaged by the Australian War Memorial to undertake a 
cultural heritage assessment of the Australian War Memorial’s two precincts at Campbell and Mitchell, 
for the heritage identification and assessment program of the AWM Commonwealth Heritage Register.
The Campbell site is situated east of the city and lies at the foot of Mount Ainslie, including the National 
Memorial and Grounds. The Campbell precinct is bound by Limestone Avenue, Fairbairn Avenue and 
Treloar Crescent, Campbell (Figure 1.1).
The Mitchell precinct is located in North Canberra and consists of three buildings including Annex A - 
Mitchell Conservation and Repository, Treloar B and Treloar C (Figure 1.2).The Mitchell property is 
situated on both sides of Vicars Street and is further bound by Lysaght and Callan Streets.
This report collates and documents the results of the indigenous cultural heritage assessment 
conducted for the Australian War Memorial Campbell and Mitchell sites. The assessment included 
consultation with ACT Aboriginal community organisations, database and literature review and field 
survey of the subject areas. The report will assist with the Australian War Memorial’s assessment for 
the development of the Commonwealth Heritage Register regarding indigenous heritage values.
The report was commissioned by Godden Mackay Logan.

2. ABORIGINAL PARTICIPATION
Four Registered Aboriginal Organisations (RAOs) have an interest in cultural heritage issues in the 
ACT and are registered with the ACT Heritage Unit. They are the:
•
Consultative Body Aboriginal Corporation (CBAC);
•
Buru Ngunnawal Aboriginal Corporation (Buru Ngunnawal);
•
Ngarigu Currawong Clan (Ngarigu); and
•
Little Gudgenby River Tribal Council.
Contact was made with each group to inform them of the project and to organise representation during 
the field survey. Subsequently, Justin Williams from the CBAC, Don Bell from Buru Ngunnawal and 
Graeme Riley from Ngarigu, attended the program at the Campbell Precinct.
Justin Williams (CBAC) and Don Bell (Buru Ngunnawal) were in attendance during the survey of the 
Mitchell Precinct, the team was accompanied by Craig Seaton from the Australian War Memorial.
A copy of this draft report will be forwarded to the participating RAOs for review and comment prior to 
finalisation.

3. STUDY METHODOLOGY
3.1 Literature and Database Review
A range of documentation was reviewed in assessing archaeological knowledge for the Campbell and 
Mitchell study areas and surrounds. This literature and data review was used to determine if known 
Aboriginal sites were located within the area under investigation, to facilitate site prediction on the basis 
of known regional and local site patterns, and to place the area within an archaeological and heritage 
management context.
Aboriginal literature sources included the Heritage Online database (HERO) maintained by the ACT 
Heritage Unit, and associated files and catalogue of archaeological reports.
Searches were undertaken of the following heritage registers and schedules:
•
The National Heritage List (Australian Heritage Council);
•
The Commonwealth Heritage List (Australian Heritage Council);
•
The Register of the National Estate (Australian Heritage Council);
•
The Heritage Register (ACT Heritage Council); and
•
Register of the National Trust of Australia (ACT).
3.2 Fieldwork
Fieldwork was conducted over one day in February 2008. Field survey was conducted on foot and 
involved inspection of all areas of ground surface visibility within the Campbell and Mitchell study areas.
3.3 Project Personnel
Field survey was undertaken by archaeologists Rebecca Yit and Nicola Hayes. Sites Officers Mr Don 
Bell (Buru Ngunawal), Grahame Riley (Ngarigu) and Justin Williams (CBAC) were also in attendance. 
Craig Seaton (AWM) provided assistance at the AWM Campbell Precinct.
This report was prepared by Rebecca Yit.
3.4 Recording Parameters
The archaeological survey aimed at identifying material evidence of Aboriginal occupation as revealed 
by surface artefacts and areas of archaeological potential unassociated with surface artefacts. 
Potential recordings fall into three categories: isolated finds, sites and potential archaeological 
deposits.
Isolated finds
An isolated find is a single stone artefact, not located within a rock shelter, and which occurs without 
any associated evidence of Aboriginal occupation within a radius of 60 metres. Isolated finds may be 
indicative of:
•
Random loss or deliberate discard of a single artefact;
•
The remnant of a now dispersed and disturbed artefact scatter; and
•
An otherwise obscured or sub-surface artefact scatter.

Except in the case of the latter, isolated finds are considered to be constituent components of the
background scatter present within any particular landform.
The distance used to define an isolated artefact varies according to the survey objectives, the incidence 
of ground surface exposure, the extent of ground surface disturbance, and estimates of background 
scatter or background discard densities. In the absence of baseline information relating to background 
scatter densities, the defining distance for an isolated find must be based on methodological and 
visibility considerations. Given the varied incidence of ground surface exposure and deposit 
disturbance within the study area, and the lack of background baseline data, the specification of 60 
metres is considered to be an effective parameter for surface survey methodologies. This distance 
provides a balance between detecting fine scale patterns of Aboriginal occupation and avoiding 
environmental biases caused by ground disturbance or high ground surface exposure rates. The 60 
metre parameter has provided an effective separation of low density artefact occurrences in similar 
southeast Australian topographies outside of semi-arid landscapes.
Background scatter
Background scatter is a term used generally by archaeologists to refer to artefacts which cannot be 
usefully related to a place or focus of past activity (except for the net accumulation of single artefact 
losses).
However, there is no single concept for background discard or 'scatter', and therefore no agreed 
definition. The definitions in current use are based on the postulated nature of prehistoric activity, and 
often they are phrased in general terms and do not include quantitative criteria. Commonly agreed is 
that background discard occurs in the absence of 'focused' activity involving the production or discard 
of stone artefacts in a particular location. An example of unfocused activity is occasional isolated 
discard of artefacts during travel along a route or pathway. Examples of 'focused activity' are camping, 
knapping and heat-treating stone, cooking in a hearth, and processing food with stone tools. In 
practical terms, over a period of thousands of years an accumulation of 'unfocused' discard may result 
in an archaeological concentration that may be identified as a 'site'. Definitions of background discard 
comprising only qualitative criteria do not specify the numbers (numerical flux) or 'density' of artefacts 
required to discriminate site areas from background discard.
Sites
A site is defined as any material evidence of past Aboriginal activity that remains within a context or 
place which can be reliably related to that activity.
Frequently encountered site types within southeastern Australia include open artefact scatters, coastal 
and freshwater middens, rock shelter sites including occupation deposit and/or rock art, grinding 
groove sites and scarred trees. For the purposes of this section, only the methodologies used in the 
identification of these site types are outlined.
Most Aboriginal sites are identified by the presence of three main categories of artefacts: stone or shell 
artefacts situated on or in a sedimentary matrix, marks located on or in rock surfaces, and scars on 
trees. Artefacts situated within, or on, a sedimentary matrix in an open context are classed as a site 
when two or more occur no more than 60 metres away from any other constituent artefact. The 60 
metre specification relates back to the definition of an isolated find (Refer above).
Any location containing one or more marks of Aboriginal origin on rock surfaces is classed as a site. 
Marks typically consist of grinding features such as grinding grooves for hatchet heads, and rock art 
such as engravings, drawings or paintings. The boundaries of these sites are defined according to the 
spatial extent of the marks, or the extent of the overhang, depending on which is most applicable to 
the spatial and temporal integrity of the site.

4. ENVIRONMENTAL CONTEXT
The Australian War Memorial study area comprises two precincts, situated at Campbell and Mitchell in 
northern ACT.
4.1 Campbell Precinct
The Campbell precinct study area consists of the National Memorial and Grounds and comprises an 
area of approximately of 14 hectares. The Campbell study area is contained by the major arterial roads 
of Limestone Avenue to the southwest and Fairbairn Avenue to the south. Treloar Crescent encloses 
the northern and eastern boundaries of the study area. The site houses four buildings including the 
Australian War Memorial, the CEW Bean Building, the Administration Building and the Outpost Café. 
The grounds of the precinct have been extensively landscaped to contain memorials, plaques, a parade 
garden and commemorative and landscape plantings (Figure 4.1).
The study area consists predominantly of the lower southwest facing basal slopes of the Mount Ainslie 
and Mount Pleasant ridgeline water catchment. An unnamed tributary draining into Lake Burley Griffin 
is located along the eastern boundary of the study area.
The bedrock geology of the Campbell precinct is dominated by the Ainslie volcanics which consists of 
Devonian rocks including rhyolite, dacite, tuff, and quartz porphyry (Canberra 1:250,000 geological 
map 2nd Ed 1964). Soils within the area typically include red earths and red and yellow podzolic soils. 
Massive earths of a red or brown colour occur on the fan deposits flanking Mount Ainslie (Walker 1978).
The Campbell study area is characterised by a constructed undulating landscape where extensive 
landscaping and modification has subsumed the original landscape topography. Vegetation at the 
Campbell site represents contemporary plantings since the 1940s (pers. comm. Craig Seaton, AWM). 
Plantings of eucalypts and wattles have been developed on the eastern portion of the study area, 
appearing as an extension of the Mount Ainslie vegetation (Figure 4.2). Exotic species of deciduous 
and coniferous trees (Figure 4.3) have been developed on the western portion of the site (Australian 
Heritage List #105889 Australian War Memorial and the Memorial Parade, Anzac Pde, Campbell, 
ACT).
Extensive landuse impacts and modification to the Campbell site has resulted in widespread 
disturbance of the upper soil layers within the study area. The types of landscape disturbance which 
are evident within the study area include:
•
Original clearance of the native tree cover and understorey;
•
Construction of memorial buildings and associated structures, access tracks and roadways;
•
Construction of public utility easements (for example, gas pipelines, communication cables 
and power lines);
•
Major earthworks associated with contour mounding and creekline realignments; and
•
Creation and maintenance of exotic and native plantings including ripping of soils.
Changes in vegetation cover will have had considerable impact on the upper soil profile throughout the 
study area. The removal of native vegetation would have prompted erosion and surface instability on 
the valley slopes and the sedimentation of the valley floor.
This land use history will have significantly impacted the survival and integrity of the prehistoric 
archaeological record. It is probable that any possible surface scatters of artefacts which occur within 
the uppermost soil layers will have undergone varying degrees of horizontal and vertical disturbance 
particularly from the removal of vegetation and extensive plantings. However, unless impact has been 
wholesale, (such as in excavation, filling or recontouring) it is frequently possible to identify a remnant 
scatter of disturbed artefacts which mark such sites.

4.2 Mitchell Precinct
The Mitchell precinct consists of three conservation and storage buildings situated on the east and 
western side of Vicars Street, Mitchell. The buildings include Treloar A (Annexe A-Mitchell 
Conservation and Repository), Treloar B and Treloar C.
The Mitchell study area has undergone extensive landscape modification and some 90% of the ground 
surface is obscured by structures which have been constructed almost to the limits of the property.. A 
narrow margin of land to the east of Treloar A represents the only exposed ground surface within the 
Mitchell precinct study area. This area has been extensively disturbed by construction activities. In 
addition, the majority of the ground surface has been covered with concrete, bitumen or paved. Figures 
4.4 and 4.5 provide views of the ground surface exposure east of Treloar A.
The bedrock geology consists of Lower Silurian mudstone, siltstone and minor shale and chert 
belonging to the Canberra Formation typical of the geology of the north Canberra area. The rock

base is bedded almost vertically and consists predominantly of platey, soft, weathered shales. Narrow 
protruding outcrops of more resistant bedrock occur throughout the non-alluvial topography of the 
area. These are mostly discontinuous or locally isolated outcrops consisting predominantly of shales 
and variously graded and fractured chert.
Vegetation within the Mitchell precinct consists of very sparse remnant native woodland trees, to 
natural Eucalypt woodland in varying states of regeneration and understorey density. Sullivans Creek, 
which runs adjacent to the western boundary of the Mitchell Precinct, has been extensively modified 
and channelised. This is likely to have caused major disturbance to any archaeological deposits 
occurring along the original creekline.
Similar to the Campbell site, the land use history of the Mitchell precinct will have significantly impacted 
the survival and integrity of the prehistoric archaeological record. It is probable that any archaeological 
deposits occurring within this location have been extensively disturbed, covered, and/or destroyed.

5. ABORIGINAL CONTEXT
5.1 Tribal Boundaries and Ethnohistory
Tribal boundaries within Australia are based largely on linguistic evidence and it is probable that 
boundaries, clan estates and band ranges were fluid and varied over time. Consequently 'tribal 
boundaries' as delineated today must be regarded as approximations only, and relative to the period 
of, or immediately before, European contact. Social interaction across these language boundaries 
appears to have been a common occurrence.
According to Tindale (1940) the territories of the Ngunawal, Ngarigo and the Walgalu peoples coincide 
and meet in the Queanbeyan area. The Fairbairn Avenue study area probably falls within the tribal 
boundaries of the Ngunnawal people.
References to the traditional Aboriginal inhabitants of the Canberra region are rare and often difficult 
to interpret (Flood 1980). The consistent impression however is one of rapid depopulation and a 
desperate disintegration of a traditional way of life over little more than fifty years from initial white 
contact (Officer 1989). The disappearance of the Aborigines from the tablelands was probably 
accelerated by the impact of European diseases which may have included the smallpox epidemic in 
1830, influenza, and a severe measles epidemic by the 1860's (Flood 1980, Butlin 1983).
By the 1850's the traditional Aboriginal economy had largely been replaced by an economy based on 
European commodities and supply points. Reduced population, isolation from the most productive 
grasslands, and the destruction of traditional social networks meant that the final decades of the 
region's semi-traditional indigenous culture and economy was centred around white settlements and 
properties (Officer 1989).
By 1856 the local 'Canberra Tribe', presumably members of the Ngunnawal, were reported to number 
around seventy (Schumack 1967) and by 1872 recorded as only five or six 'survivors' (Goulburn Herald 
9 Nov 1872). In 1873 one so-called 'pure blood' member remained, known to the white community as 
Nelly Hamilton or 'Queen Nellie'.
Combined with other ethnohistoric evidence, this lack of early sightings of Aborigines led Flood (1980) 
to suggest that the Aboriginal population density in the Canberra region and Southern Uplands was 
generally quite low.
Frequently, only 'pure blooded' individuals were considered 'Aboriginal' or 'tribal' by European 
observers. This consideration made possible the assertion of local tribal 'extinctions'. In reality, 'Koori' 
and tribal identity remained integral to the descendants of the nineteenth century Ngunnawal people, 
some of whom continue to live in the Canberra-Queanbeyan-Yass region.
5.2 Regional Background for the Campbell Precinct
A number of archaeological studies have been carried out in areas east of Canberra City and in the 
general region around Fairbairn Avenue. Studies have been conducted in the Majura Valley (Winston-
Gregson 1985; AASC 1995, 1998; Navin Officer Heritage Consultants 1998, 1999a & b,
2001, 2006) and Campbell (Navin Officer Heritage Consultants 1997).
Studies conducted in the Majura Valley to the northeast and east of Fairbairn Avenue have assessed 
a variety of landscape types.
In 1998 AASC conducted a cultural heritage survey of the Army’s Majura Field Firing Range at Majura, 
an area of approximately 39.5 km2. An estimated 15% of the study area was sampled by the survey, 
with survey transects biased toward existing ground exposures and riparian zones. Ground surface 
visibility encountered by the survey was 'on average low to moderate across the entire study area’ and 
it was considered that the 'effective survey coverage' obtained was sufficient to have provided an 
effective assessment (AASC 1998:23). This study is, however, limited by a generalised and qualitative 
landform analysis and site specific management recommendations.

Forty two Aboriginal sites were recorded during the Majura Field Firing Range study. The majority of 
Aboriginal sites were small scatters of stone artefacts with the largest scatter containing thirty visible 
artefacts. Five scarred trees were also recorded. Two hundred and twenty two stone artefacts were 
recorded within the total assemblage for the Firing Range.
A detailed cultural heritage survey and assessment of a preferred Majura Valley Transport Corridor 
easement (Navin Officer Heritage Consultants 1999a) was conducted as part of a broader study 
investigating an appropriate alignment for the future construction of the Majura Parkway between the 
Federal Highway and Fairbairn Avenue. The proposed transport corridor was situated generally (within) 
500 m west of the actual fluvial streamline of Woolshed Creek. The results of background research 
and field survey indicated that three Aboriginal artefact scatter sites were located within or close to the 
proposed easement.
In 1999(b) Navin Officer Heritage Consultants was commissioned to undertake a project to identify 
places and areas of possible cultural heritage significance in those parts of the Majura Valley not 
already examined for cultural heritage values. Prior to this study, Thirty two Aboriginal sites and isolated 
finds had been recorded. These included seventeen open artefact scatters, one scarred tree, thirteen 
isolated finds and one artefact scatter with associated reported quarry or stone procurement site. The 
1999(b) field survey resulted in a further nineteen artefact scatters, twenty six isolated finds, three 
scarred trees and one potential archaeological deposit being recorded for the valley.
Navin Officer Heritage Consultants (1999b) noted a broad trend toward Aboriginal site location in valley 
floor and basal slope contexts. Within the small-scale landform categories, the most frequently 
recorded site contexts were: spurlines (41%), minor streamline margins (30%), major streamline 
margins (24%), terrace and alluvial flats (19%), basal slopes (17%), crests (14%), and mid slopes 
(12%). These frequencies indicate a preference for contexts which are locally elevated, have level 
ground, and are in close proximity (up to 100 m) to a water source. Riparian zones and mid valley to 
valley floor context spurline crests were considered to be the most archaeologically sensitive landforms 
within the Majura Valley. The potential archaeological resource within alluvial and valley floor contexts 
was possibly significantly under-represented due to the difficulty in detecting sites in aggrading and 
sedimentary contexts.
Southeast of the Fairbairn Avenue study area Trudinger (1989) conducted research for her Litt B thesis 
on artefact occurrences within the source bordering sand deposits north of the Molonglo River at 
Pialligo.
An assessment of alternative options for the proposed John Dedman Drive (Navin Officer Heritage 
Consultants 1997) included an Option 5 - which crossed Fairbairn Avenue at Northcott Drive. The 
option was not subject to field survey. However, based on geomorphological characteristics and 
degrees of landuse disturbance, the section of route crossing Fairbairn Avenue was assessed as 
having some potential to contain Aboriginal sites and requiring archaeological survey.
Cultural heritage assessment of two duplication options for the upgrade of Fairbairn Avenue to dual 
carriageway from Anzac Parade to Morshead Drive was undertaken in 2001 (Navin Officer Heritage 
Consultants). Field survey involved the Fairbairn Avenue route options and locations of the proposed 
traffic circles at Treloar Cresent and Northcott Drive. One low-density surface scatter of Aboriginal 
artefacts was identified adjacent to the intersection with Mount Ainslie Drive. The site (FA1) comprised 
of six artefacts on the southern side of Fairbairn Drive identified over a vehicle track and associated 
exposures. The site was assessed as containing minimal scientific value.
During 2006, Navin Officer Heritage Consultants undertook survey for the proposed Majura Parkway 
to replace the existing Majura Road between Fairbairn Avenue and the Federal Highway. A total of fifty 
seven previously recorded and newly recorded Aboriginal sites were identified within the study area. 
The majority of the sites were scatters artefacts and it was observed that such sites are common within 
the Majura Valley and the ACT in general.
5.3 The Campbell Precinct
No Aboriginal sites have previously been recorded as occurring within the Campbell precinct study 
area.

5.4 Regional Background for the Mitchell Precinct
Archaeological surveys in the ACT have resulted in the location of numerous archaeological sites in 
northern Canberra. The most common site type is the open artefact scatter, however scarred trees, 
grinding grooves, a possible ochre source and lithic raw material sources have also been identified in 
the area. Surveys and investigations carried out in this area are summarised below.
The Canberra Archaeological Society (CAS) conducted the first archaeological survey in the northern 
Canberra area in 1975-76. The survey located 'seven sites' and a larger number of 'less significant 
finds' (Bindon & Pike 1979). These results were re-assessed by Anutech (1984) who concluded that 
nine sites and fifteen isolated finds had been located by the CAS.
Seven of the nine sites located by the CAS were located close to streamlines, and twelve of the fifteen 
isolated finds were located within 100-200 m of streamlines.
Other surveys by the Canberra Archaeological Society added substantially to the database of both 
prehistoric and historic archaeological information for the area (Witter 1984; Winston-Gregson 1986).
Witter (1980) surveyed a 20 m wide easement for a gas pipeline running between Dalton and Canberra. 
His survey crossed the Yass River and traversed hilly country in the centre of the Upper Yass River 
catchment. Eleven artefact scatters containing small silcrete flakes and some blades were recorded 
during the survey. The following year Witter (1981) fully excavated one site (DC2) and collected the 
surface artefacts from six sites (DC1, DC5, DC6, DC9, DC11 & DC12).
More generalised studies were conducted for the EIS prepared for the Gungahlin development release 
area (Anutech 1984, NCDC 1989) and for the compilation of the Sites of Significance volume on 
Gungahlin and Belconnen (NCDC 1988). The Anutech investigation identified several general 
consistencies in site location. A majority of sites were classed as located on creek banks, on low- lying 
but well-drained areas, and within 150 m of the junction of two creeks. This was postulated to indicate 
a preference for topographically confined parts of valley floors where protection from wind is greatest. 
At a majority of sites, artefactual material was exposed as subsurface material eroding from A horizon 
sediments (Anutech 1984:24).
Although this model was considered to be incorrect by some researchers (Access Archaeology 1991:8) 
further comparative work by Navin and Officer (1991, 1992) tended to confirm the locational model 
proposed by Anutech. The majority of open artefact scatters, particularly larger sites, are situated 
adjacent to or in close proximity to creek flats or valley bottom contexts, frequently on low gradient 
basal slopes adjacent to streams.
With the release of large areas of land for urban development in north Canberra several larger scale 
systematic archaeological surveys were undertaken to define the archaeological resource of the 
subject areas (eg Officer and Navin 1992; Kuskie 1992; Wood & Paton 1992). Numerous other 
archaeological assessments have been carried out for smaller land areas which were likely to be 
affected by specific proposed developments such as roads, golf courses, water storage facilities, 
pipelines etc.
The closest archaeological investigation to the present study area is a survey of a proposed gas 
pipeline easement from the Federal Highway to Majura Parkway conducted by Saunders (1995). No 
sites were located during the course of the survey.
Navin (1992) undertook a reconnaissance level archaeological survey carried out for a proposed 
release of land for urban infill purposes at North Watson, and heritage investigations for the duplication 
of a 10.7 km section of the Federal Highway in North Canberra (Navin, Officer and Legge 1995, 1996).
In 1992 a reconnaissance level archaeological survey was carried out for a proposed release of land 
for urban infill purposes at North Watson. The area comprised approximately 200 ha of low gradient 
slopes and foothills on the western fall of Mount Majura. Spurs and drainage lines in the area were 
generally broad and poorly defined and there were no major drainage beds or permanent water sources 
in the area. Vegetation consisted of open woodland with isolated or relict scatters of mature

Eucalypts situated within established pasture. Around 40% of the study area had undergone extensive 
landscape disturbance as a result of a variety of developments.
The North Watson study area as a whole was considered to have low archaeological potential. This 
was based on the lack of permanent water, major drainage lines, and economic rock types, and the 
degree of recent landscape disturbance. Features of relative archaeological potential were defined as 
mature native trees, relatively undisturbed streamlines and comparatively flat topographic land units 
(particularly where close to water).
In August 1995 a corridor selection study was undertaken which assessed two possible Federal 
Highway duplication alternatives (Navin, Officer and Legge 1995) and subsequently further detailed 
studies were undertaken for the EIS for the duplication (Navin, Officer and Legge 1996). Thus five 
Aboriginal sites and four isolated finds were located in the Federal Highway Duplication study area.
During 2004, Navin Officer Heritage Consultants undertook survey of Blocks 2 and 3, Section 75, 
Watson for redevelopment as a residential precinct. Two Aboriginal sites (CF1 and CF2) comprising of 
artefact scatters were identified on the surface of eroded contexts. Site CF1 was situated on a sloping 
adjacent to a remnant creek line while site CF2 was identified on sloping ground of a spurline crest. It 
was noted that both sites did not represent in situ material and there appeared to be little potential for 
subsurface deposits (Navin Officer Heritage Consultants 2004).

No Aboriginal sites have previously been recorded as occurring within the Mitchell precinct study area.

6. RESULTS
6.1 Aboriginal Sites
No Aboriginal sites have been previously identified within the Australian War Memorial Campbell and 
Mitchell Precinct study areas.
No Aboriginal sites or areas of archaeological potential/sensitivity were identified in the Mitchell 
Australian War Memorial Precinct study area in the course of the current investigation.
One Aboriginal site, isolated find (AWM1), was identified in the Campbell Australian War Memorial 
Precinct study area in the course of the current investigation. No areas of archaeological 
potential/sensitivity were identified. The location of the site is shown in Figure 6.3.

CSMG Ref: 212822.603746 [using GEOMIN32 conversion program]
This recording consists of an isolated stone artefact situated to the west of Treloar Crescent, in the 
eastern corner of the Australian War Memorial, Campbell precinct. The artefact was identified on an 
exposure on the crest of a slight rise, adjacent to the road (Figures 6.1 and 6.2). The find is situated 3 
m from the road and approximately 20 m north of Treloar Crescent and Fairbairn Avenue junction.
Significant ground disturbance associated with the installation of a gas pipeline and the spreading of 
road metal has occurred within the artefact location.
The isolated find is a commonly occurring artefact type and is made from commonly occurring stone 
type. The flake occurs as a 'loose', possibly lagged or disturbed surface feature. The potential for 
subsurface and in situ artefactual material to remain at this site is considered to be minimal due to the 
shallow nature of the soil and the extent of previous ground disturbance.
Ground exposure in the area was estimated at 80% with 30% visibility in the area of exposure.

6.2 Survey Coverage and Visibility Variables
The effectiveness of archaeological field survey is to a large degree related to the obtrusiveness of the 
sites being looked for and the incidence and quality of ground surface visibility. Visibility variables were 
estimated for all areas of comprehensive survey within the study area. These estimates provide a 
measure with which to gauge the effectiveness of the survey and level of sampling conducted. They 
can also be used to gauge the number and type of sites that may not have been detected by the 
survey.
Ground surface visibility is a measure of the bare ground visible to the archaeologist during the survey. 
There are two main variables used to assess ground surface visibility, the frequency of exposure 
encountered by the surveyor and the quality of visibility within those exposures. The predominant 
factors affecting the quality of ground surface visibility within an exposure are the extent of vegetation 
and ground litter, the depth and origin of exposure, the extent of recent sedimentary deposition, and 
the level of visual interference from surface gravels.
The incidence of ground surface exposure at the Campbell Precinct varied enormously across the site 
with greater exposure and visibility in the eastern portion of the study area. It was estimated that 20% 
ground exposures with 30% visibility within the exposures characterised the eastern half while this 
decreased significantly across the western portion of the Campbell site. The low level of visibility for an 
open context is due to the thick grass coverage from extensive landscaping.
The incidence of ground exposure at the Mitchell precinct was limited to a small portion of highly 
disturbed ground within Treloar A measuring approximately 80 x 40 m. Visibility within this area was 
estimated at 40% with coverage of imported gravels.

7. SIGNIFICANCE ASSESSMENT
7.1 Commonwealth Heritage Assessment Criteria
The Commonwealth Heritage List is a register of natural and cultural heritage places owned or 
controlled by the Australian Government. These may include places associated with a range of 
activities such as communications, customs, defence or the exercise of government. The Environment 
Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 establishes this list and nominations are assessed 
by the Australian Heritage Council.
In accordance with the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 a place has a 
Commonwealth Heritage value if it meets one of the Commonwealth Heritage criteria (section 341D).
A place meets the Commonwealth Heritage listing criterion if the place has significant heritage value 
because of one or more of the following:
a)
The place's importance in the course, or pattern, of Australia's natural or cultural history;
b)
The place's possession of uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of Australia's natural or 
cultural history;
c)
The place's potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Australia's 
natural or cultural history;
d)
The place's importance in demonstrating the principal characteristics of:
i.
a class of Australia's natural or cultural places; or
ii.
a class of Australia's natural or cultural environments;
e)
The place's importance in exhibiting particular aesthetic characteristics valued by a community 
or cultural group;
f)
The place's importance in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at 
a particular period;
g)
The place's strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for 
social, cultural or spiritual reasons;
h)
The place's special association with the life or works of a person, or group of persons, of 
importance in Australia's natural or cultural history; and
i)
The place's importance as part of Indigenous tradition.
Thresholds
While a place can be assessed against the above criteria for its heritage value, this may not always be 
sufficient to determine whether it is worthy of inclusion on the Commonwealth Heritage List. The 
Australian Heritage Council may also need to use a second test, by applying a 'significance threshold', 
to help it decide. This test helps the Council to judge the level of significance of a place's heritage value 
by asking 'just how important are these values?'
To be entered on the Commonwealth Heritage List a place will usually be of local or state-level 
significance.

Commonwealth Heritage Management Principles
In addition to the above criteria and thresholds, Schedule 7B of the Environment Protection and 
Biodiversity Conservation Regulations 2000 (Regulation 10.03D) lists the Commonwealth Heritage 
Management Principles. These principles are:
1.
The objective in managing Commonwealth Heritage places is to identify, protect, conserve, 
present and transmit, to all generations, their Commonwealth Heritage values.
2.
The management of Commonwealth Heritage places should use the best available knowledge, 
skills and standards for those places, and include ongoing technical and community input to 
decisions and actions that may have a significant impact on their Commonwealth Heritage 
values.
3.
The management of Commonwealth Heritage places should respect all heritage values of the 
place and seek to integrate, where appropriate, any Commonwealth, State, Territory and local 
government responsibilities for those places.
4.
The management of Commonwealth Heritage places should ensure that their use and 
presentation is consistent with the conservation of their Commonwealth Heritage values.
5.
The management of Commonwealth Heritage places should make timely and appropriate 
provision for community involvement, especially by people who:
a)
Have a particular interest in, or associations with, the place; and
b)
May be affected by the management of the place.
6.
Indigenous people are the primary source of information on the value of their heritage and that 
the active participation of indigenous people in identification, assessment and management is 
integral to the effective protection of indigenous heritage values.
7.
The management of Commonwealth Heritage places should provide for regular monitoring, 
review and reporting on the conservation of Commonwealth Heritage values.
When assessing the Commonwealth heritage significance of places within the study area, in addition 
to applying the primary and secondary tests of the Commonwealth Heritage Listing criteria and the 
significance thresholds, reference also needs to be made to the above Commonwealth Heritage 
Management Principles. The latter is particularly relevant to the study area where there are:
•
Other heritage values of the place that are the responsibility of the ACT Government 
(Principle 3); and
•
A number of indigenous places for which the primary source of information on the value of their 
heritage has been provided through the active participation of local Aboriginal communities 
(Principle 6).
7.2 Significance
Given its disturbed context and the lack of rare or notable features, the archaeological significance of 
isolated find AWM1 is considered to be low. However, all Aboriginal archaeological recordings retain 
significance for the local Aboriginal community. Aboriginal representative Mr Don Bell expressed 
concern that the Aboriginal recording within the Campbell study area be protected as much as possible 
from any potential direct impacts resulting from any future development.
As representatives of ACT Aboriginal stakeholder groups have indicated that the isolated find, AWM1, 
recorded in the Campbell Precinct is valued by the local Aboriginal community as important as part of 
the local indigenous tradition, the site meets Criterion (i) of the Commonwealth Heritage Listing criteria.
Further, as the site is considered to have significant heritage value to local Aboriginal community 
groups it meets the threshold for recording on the Commonwealth Heritage List.

8. STATUTORY INFORMATION1
8.1 Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999
This Act (EPBC Act) repeals the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, the National 
Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975, the Whale Protection Act 1980, the World Heritage 
Properties Conservation Act 1983, and the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992. The scope and 
coverage of the Act is wide and far-reaching. The objectives of the Act include: the protection of the 
environment, especially those aspects of national significance; to promote the conservation of 
biodiversity and ecologically sustainable development; and to recognise the role of indigenous people 
and their knowledge in realising these aims.
The Act makes it a criminal offence to undertake actions having a significant impact on any matter of 
national environmental significance (NES) without the approval of the Environment Minister. Actions 
which have, may have or are likely to have a relevant impact on a matter of NES may be taken only:
•
In accordance with an assessment bilateral agreement (which may accredit a State approval 
process) or a declaration (which may accredit another Commonwealth approval process); and
•
With the approval of the Environment Minister under Part 9 of the Act. An action that requires 
this Commonwealth approval is called a ‘controlled action’
Matters of national environmental significance (NES) are defined as:
•
A place listed on the National Heritage List;
•
World heritage values within declared World Heritage Properties (section 12(1));
•
Ramsar wetlands of international importance (s16(1));
•
Nationally threatened species and communities (s18);
•
Migratory species protected under international agreements (s20);
•
Nuclear actions;
•
The Commonwealth marine environment (generally outside 3 nautical miles from the coast) 
(s23(1&2)); and
•
Any additional matters specified by regulation (following consultation with the States) (s25).
In addition, the Act makes it a criminal offence to take on Commonwealth land an action that has, will 
have, or is likely to have a significant impact on the environment (section 26(1)). A similar prohibition 
(without approval) operates in respect of actions taken outside of Commonwealth land, if it has, or is 
likely to have a significant impact on the environment on Commonwealth land (s26(2)). Section 28, in 
general, requires that the Commonwealth (or its agencies) must gain approval (unless otherwise 
excluded from this provision), prior to conducting actions which has, will, or is likely to have a significant 
impact on the environment inside or outside the Australian jurisdiction.
The Act adopts a broad definition of the environment that is inclusive of cultural heritage values. In 
particular, the ‘environment’ is defined to include the social, economic and cultural aspects of 
ecosystems, natural and physical resources, and the qualities and characteristics of locations; places 
and areas (s528).
The Act allows for several means by which a controlled action can be assessed, including an accredited 
assessment process, a public environment report, an environmental impact statement, and a public 
inquiry (Part 8).

Section 68 imposes an obligation on a proponent proposing to take an action that it considers to be a 
controlled action, to refer it to the Environment Minister for approval.
World heritage values are defined to be inclusive of natural and cultural heritage (s12(3)), and a 
declared World Heritage Property is one included on the World Heritage List, or is declared to be such 
by the Minister (s13 and s14). The Act defines various procedures, objectives and Commonwealth 
obligations relating to the nomination and management of World Heritage Properties (Part 15, division 
1).
8.2 Environment and Heritage Legislation Amendment Act (No 1) 2003
Australian Heritage Council Act 2003 and
Australian Heritage Council (Consequential and Transitional Provisions) Act 2003
These three Acts replace the previous Commonwealth heritage regime instigated by the Australian 
Heritage Commission Act 1975. The Acts establish the following provisions:
The National Heritage List
The National Heritage List is a schedule of places which the Minister for the Environment and Heritage 
considers to have ‘National Heritage Value’ based on prescribed ‘National Heritage Criteria’. The List 
many include places outside of Australia if agreed to by the Country concerned. There is a public 
nomination process and provision for public consultation on nominations. Expert advice regarding 
nominations is provided to the Minister by the Australian Heritage Council.
A nominated place considered to be at risk can be placed on an emergency list while its heritage value 
is assessed.
The listing of a place is defined as a ‘matter of national environmental significance’ under the EPBC 
Act. As a consequence, the Minister must grant approval prior to the conduct of any proposed actions 
which will, or are likely to have, a significant impact on the National Heritage values of a listed place.
The Minister is to ensure that there are approved management plans for most listed places owned or 
controlled by the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth agency, and that Commonwealths actions are 
in accord with such plans.
The Commonwealth or its agencies cannot sell or lease a listed place unless the protection of its 
National Heritage values is specified in a covenant, or such an action is found to be unnecessary, 
unreasonable or impractical. All Commonwealth agencies which own or control places which have or 
may have National Heritage values, must take all reasonable steps to assist the Minister and Australian 
Heritage Council to identify and assess those values.
The Commonwealth Heritage List
The Commonwealth Heritage List is a schedule of places owned or controlled by the Commonwealth, 
which the Environment Minister considers to have ‘Commonwealth Heritage Value’. The list may 
include places outside of Australia. The processes of nomination and assessment are similar to those 
for the National Heritage List. Like the National Heritage List, there is a provision for emergency listing.
The Act places a range of obligations on the Commonwealth Agencies with regard to places included 
on the Commonwealth Heritage List. These include:
•
Development of a heritage strategy applicable to all listed places controlled by the agency;
•
Preparation of a management plan for each listed place;
•
Conduct of a program to identify Commonwealth Heritage values on lands controlled by the 
agency and maintaining a register of such values;

•
Ensuring that no action is taken which has, will have, or is likely to have an adverse impact on 
the National Heritage values of a National Heritage Place, or the Commonwealth Heritage values 
of a Commonwealth Heritage Place, unless there is no feasible or prudent alternative and all 
reasonable measures to mitigate impact have been taken; and
•
Including a covenant in any sale or lease contract for land which includes a Commonwealth 
Heritage place which stipulates the protection of the Commonwealth Heritage values of that 
place, unless such an action is found by the agency to be unnecessary, unreasonable or 
impractical.
The Australian Heritage Council
The Australian Heritage Council provides expert advice to the Minister on heritage issues and 
nominations for the listing of places on the National Heritage List and the Commonwealth Heritage List. 
The Council replaces the former Australian Heritage Commission.
The Register of the National Estate
The register of the National Estate was established under the now repealed Australian Heritage 
Commission Act 1975. The National Estate was defined under this Act as ‘those places, being 
components of the natural environment of Australia or the cultural environment of Australia, that have 
aesthetic, historical, scientific or social significance or other special value for future generations as well 
as for the present community’. Under the new Commonwealth Acts, the Register will be retained and 
maintained by Australian Heritage Council as a publicly accessible database for public education and 
the promotion of heritage conservation. Nominations will assessed by the Australian Heritage Council. 
The Minister must consider the information in the Register when making decisions under the EPBC 
Act. A transitional provision allows for the Minister to determine which of the places on the Register 
and within Commonwealth areas should be transferred to the Commonwealth Heritage List.

9. CONCLUSIONS AND MANAGEMENT CONSIDERATIONS
9.1 Conclusions
No Aboriginal sites or areas of archaeological potential/sensitivity were identified in the Mitchell 
Australian War Memorial Mitchell Precinct study area in the course of the current investigation. There 
are no indigenous heritage assets or constraints relating to the Australian War Memorial Mitchell 
Precinct.
One Aboriginal site, isolated find, AWM1, was identified in the Australian War Memorial Campbell 
Precinct study area in the course of the current investigation. The site has low archaeological values, 
but is valued by the local Aboriginal community and as such it meets Criterion (i) of the Commonwealth 
Heritage Listing criteria.
9.2 Recommendations
It is recommended that:
1.
Site AWM1 be listed on the Australian War Memorial Heritage Register and the ACT Heritage 
Register.
2.
Impact to site AWM1 should be avoided, if disturbance is anticipated potential activities around 
the periphery of the site should be managed and the site fenced where appropriate to demarcate 
site boundary and to control access.
3.

Stakeholder and Community Consultation
A stakeholder is defined by the Memorial as someone who is interested in, who can influence, or 
may be impacted by heritage matters at the AWM. These stakeholders may be from within the 
Memorial, individuals or community groups, as listed below.
The AWM Heritage Strategy, Heritage Management Plan or any future works, projects or activities 
may be of interest to stakeholders. The Memorial’s Building and Services Section determine who the 
relevant stakeholders are for consultation in relation to heritage matters. This occurs on a case-by-
case basis and would be determined where the stakeholders’ interests, skills or expertise, matches
the heritage matter being considered and requiring consultation.
Consultation involves stakeholder engagement in the most suitable forum for the matter or project 
being considered, and is based upon an understanding of already identified understanding, 
familiarity and appreciation of heritage matters.
The Memorial undertakes consultation to ensure all stakeholders have a genuine opportunity to 
engage with the particular heritage-related matter or project. The Memorial’s consultation aims to 
reflect their particular expertise, or aspirations and to ensure the Stakeholders are aware, informed 
and engaged with the conservation of the National and Commonwealth Heritage values of the 
AWM.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
This heritage management plan for Anzac Parade, Canberra, provides a sound basis for the 
good management and conservation of this place and its heritage significance.  The plan:
•
describes the Parade;
•
provides an overview of the history of the place;
•
offers evidence related to aesthetic and social values;
•
analyses all of this evidence and provides a statement of significance for the place;
•
considers opportunities and constraints affecting the management of Anzac Parade;  
and
•
provides a conservation policy and implementation strategies to guide management 
and conservation.
ral
Anzac Parade is entered on the National Heritage List and the Commonwealth Heritage 
List under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, as a key 
part of larger heritage places.  These listings protect the heritage values of the place, and 
impose a number of obligations including the need to prepare a management plan.
Anzac Parade (the National Heritage section between Constitution Avenue and the 
Australian War Memorial) is of outstanding heritage value because of its importance in 
Australia’s history, as a rare form of commemoration of the relationship between Australia 
and New Zealand, for its aesthetic qualities, its creative achievement, social values and 
special associations.  Many of these values are shared with or related to the adjacent 
Australian War Memorial, and the Parade and Memorial are a single National Heritage 
place.  Anzac Parade also makes a substantial contribution to the Commonwealth Heritage 
values of the Parliament House Vista area, and is part of the Land Axis which is one of the 
two principal axes for the original design of the national capital.
The conservation policy and implementation strategies cover a wide range of matters 
including:
•
liaison;
•
landscape;
•
built elements;
•
setting for the area;
•
use of the area;
•
new development;  and
•
interpretation.
Key policies and strategies are provided related to:
•
the statement of significance set out in Chapter 7 being a principal basis for 
management, future planning and work affecting Anzac Parade (Policy 1);
•
conservation and management of the place being carried out in accordance with the 
principles of the Burra Charter (Policy 2);
•
planning documents developed for Anzac Parade or parts of the place referring to 
this management plan as a primary guide for the conservation of the heritage values 
of the Parade, with the direction given in those documents and in this plan being 
mutually compatible (Policy 5);
•
the NCA seeking to achieve integrated management between the Parade and the 
Australian War Memorial, to ensure a more consistent approach to management and

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
u  u
commemoration, and engagement with and support for the armed services 
community (Policy 6);
•
consideration of establishing an ongoing consultation mechanism with the 
Australian War Memorial to help achieve integrated management of the overall 
National Heritage place (Strategy 6.1);
•
the NCA continuing to liaise with associated groups and communities, and other 
relevant stakeholders, including community and professional groups, on 
developments affecting the place (Policy 11);
•
the NCA respecting and fostering the retention of significant associations between 
the armed services community and Anzac Parade, and with its individual memorials, 
including the sense of custodianship felt by this community (Policy 12);
•
conserving the overall landscape character of Anzac Parade including general 
qualities and specific features (Policy 13), and possibly developing a masterplan to 
address a range of issues (Strategy 13.4);
•
addressing the lack of a suitable landscape screen behind a number of memorials 
on the east of the Parade (Strategies 13.2, 16.5 and 32.4);
•
the landscape of the Parade being well maintained to reflect the significance of the 
place (Policy 14);
•
developing and implementing one or more landscape maintenance plans (Strategy 
14.2);
•
conserving the treescape of the Parade and replacing trees as necessary (Policy 16);
•
conserving the Hebe plantings (Policy 17), and developing and implementing a 
replacement strategy and maintenance manual (Strategy 17.1);
•
in general, removing the remnant native grasses within the plantation areas and not 
replacing them (the plantations being mulched), except where grasses are part of the 
designed landscape for specific memorials (Policy 18);
•
conserving existing memorials, subject to any management planning which may be 
specifically developed for memorials (Policy 21);
•
conserving the red crushed brick gravel paved median (Policy 23);
•
exploring options to change the kerbing or other ways to overcome the access 
barrier for commemorative activities presented by the kerbing (Strategy 24.1);
•
protecting the setting of Anzac Parade, including the forested character of Mount 
Ainslie (Policy 32);
•
management of the remnant sections of plantations in front of the former Anzac 
Park East Building site and remaining Anzac Park West Building (the Portal 
Buildings), consistent with the management of the other plantations in Anzac Parade 
(Strategy 32.3);
•
ensuring preservation of the symmetrical portal effect of the former Anzac Park 
East and current Anzac Park West buildings (Strategy 32.5);
•
protection of views and vistas to and from the Parade (Policy 33);
•
the primary and secondary uses of Anzac Parade (Policy 34);
•
support for commemorative activities (Strategy 34.1 and 34.2);
•
the possible provision of new public amenities within the Anzac Parade area (Policy 
39);
•
planning for possible future additional memorials beyond the current capacity of 
Anzac Parade (Policy 40);  and
•
interpreting the significance of Anzac Parade to the range of visitors who use the 
Parade, and to NCA staff (Policy 48).
A review of the conservation policy in the heritage management plan for the Australian 
War Memorial (GML Heritage 2022) found that it complemented the policy for Anzac

Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
1.
INTRODUCTION
1.1 BACKGROUND AND PROJECT OBJECTIVES
Anzac Parade (the Parade) is an extensive area in central Canberra which has been entered 
in the National Heritage List and the Commonwealth Heritage List, as part of larger 
heritage places.  In particular, it is a major part of the Australian War Memorial and the 
Memorial Parade which is on the National Heritage List.
In accordance with section 324S of the Environment Protection and Biodiversity 
Conservation Act 1999, a management plan for the place must be prepared.  The National 
Capital Authority manages Anzac Parade on behalf of the Commonwealth, and this 
heritage management plan has been prepared to assist the Minister for the Environment 
regarding this legislative obligation.  This plan is an update of a 2013 version, and takes 
into account a review of the earlier plan undertaken in accordance with section 324W of 
the EPBC Act.
However, this management plan is more than just a legislative obligation.  It is intended to 
help guide the conservation management of the area as a living and working document, 
especially with regard to changes that are or may be proposed, or which will inevitably 
arise.
The other part of the National Heritage place is the Australian War Memorial, and a 
heritage management plan has been prepared for that part (GML Heritage 2022).  The 
management plan for the Parade has been prepared to compliment the plan for the 
Memorial, and it strives to achieve comprehensive conservation management for the whole 
National Heritage place.
Anzac Parade is also a key part of the Parliament House Vista which is on the 
Commonwealth Heritage List.  The Commonwealth Heritage values of the Vista are 
provided at Appendix A.  A heritage management plan for the Vista has been prepared 
(Marshall and others 2010b), and it has been drawn-upon as appropriate in the 
development of this plan for Anzac Parade.
This heritage management plan focuses on the National Heritage values of Anzac Parade, 
and it does not consider other values, such as Commonwealth Heritage values.  To the 
extent other values exist, these are considered by the Parliament House Vista heritage 
management plan.
While most of Anzac Parade is the subject of this study, not all of it is included, as 
explained in Chapter 2.
A copy of the National Heritage List place record for the Australian War Memorial and the 
Memorial Parade, as well as the Commonwealth Heritage List place record for the 
Parliament House Vista, are reproduced at Appendix A.
A copy of the project brief is provided at Appendix B.
This heritage management plan is the same as a conservation management plan – the term 
more widely used in the heritage industry.

Key general definitions
Conservation
In this report, the term conservation is generally used to mean, 
‘all the processes of looking after a place so as to retain its 
cultural significance’ (Australia ICOMOS 2013, Article 1.4).  
These processes include maintenance, preservation, restoration, 
reconstruction and adaptation.  This definition derives from the 
Burra Charter.
In accordance with the EPBC Act 1999, the broad nature of 
cultural significance also has to be appreciated.  It includes not 
only the physical elements of a place (for example the 
architecture or landscape) but can also include intangible values 
such as historical associations, traditional use and community 
attachment.  Conservation has to take all of these values into 
account.  (See for example the National Heritage criteria at 
10.01A of the EPBC Regulations 2003 (No. 1) and the 
requirements for management plans at 10.01C of the 
regulations.)
One of the principles underpinning the Burra Charter is a 
recognition that heritage places change through time for a 
variety of reasons.  Good heritage practice manages this change 
with the objective of retaining cultural significance.  It does not 
necessarily seek to freeze a place in time, nor turn every place 
into a museum.  (See for example Australia ICOMOS 2013, 
Articles 1.9, 3.2, 15, 21, 22 and 27.)
Land Axis Corridor 
(Anzac Parade 
section)
The east and west boundaries of the Land Axis corridor related 
to Anzac Parade is defined by the boundaries of Anzac Park, 
being the planted linear parks lining either side of Anzac Parade 
but not including the roads Anzac Park East and West.
1.2
CONDUCT OF PROJECT
Overview
As a project to review and update the 2013 heritage management plan, the earlier plan 
provides the basis for the current plan.  The methodology adopted for this plan is in 
accordance with the Burra Charter (Australia ICOMOS 2013).  This can be summarised as 
a series of steps as shown in Figure 1 below.
In order to follow these steps and prepare this management plan and the earlier version, a 
range of consultations, research, inspections and analyses were undertaken.  Importantly, 
the assessment of significance relied upon:
•
a range of information gathering tasks related to the common descriptors of 
significance (for example historic value);  and
•
an analysis of this evidence for heritage values using the National Heritage criteria, 
including comparisons with other places where relevant, in order to test the 
understanding of such values.

This work provided a sound understanding of the place, and led to the preparation of a 
statement of significance.  This work also provided an understanding of the constraints and 
opportunities related to the current and future management of the place.  An important 
aspect were site inspections to assess the condition of the place, partly to consider impacts 
on heritage values.  These were carried out in a non-invasive manner to assess the integrity 
of features.
The statement of significance and the information about constraints and opportunities were 
used as the basis for developing conservation policies and implementation strategies.

Management Planning

In some cases, the information in the earlier plan was reviewed and found to be 
satisfactory for the current plan.  In other cases, the text was updated given the passage of 
time and other changes.  Some information from the 2013 plan reflects views and sources 
at that time, and some details or references may have changed.  For example, the evidence 
of community-based values, Chapter 4, derives from research undertaken for the earlier 
version of the plan.  Given the conclusions based on this information are still thought to be 
generally valid, those details and references have not been updated.
The update was also informed by the management plan review.  Details of the review can 
be found at Appendix H.
Report structure
This heritage management plan:
•
describes Anzac Parade in Sections 2.1 and 2.2;
•
provides an overview of the history of the place in Chapter 3;
•
offers evidence related to social and aesthetic values in Sections 4.1 and 4.2;
•
analyses all of this evidence in Chapter 5 and provides a statement of significance for 
the place in Chapter 6;
•
considers opportunities and constraints affecting the management of Anzac Parade in 
Chapter 7;  and
•
provides a conservation policy and implementation strategies to guide management 
and conservation in Chapter 8.
Public consultation

management plan was made available for public comment from 24 April until 24 May 
2021.
Notices were placed in the Canberra Times and The Australian on 24 April 2021 notifying 
the general public of the project, and the opportunity to comment.  The draft plan was 
publicly available on the NCA’s website, and key stakeholders were notified in writing.
As a result of this process, seven sets of written comments were provided.  In response to 
these comments, a number of modifications were made to the plan.
1.3
PURPOSE OF REPORT
The purpose of this report is to provide a management plan for the memorial part of Anzac 
Parade, to compliment that for the Australian War Memorial, as the two parts of a single 
National Heritage place.  The report is in accordance with the obligations under the EPBC 
Act, including an understanding of its heritage values (Chapter 6), and conservation 
policies and implementation strategies for its future management (Chapter 8).
1.4
LIMITATIONS AND NON-CONFORMING ASPECTS
The following factors limited the work undertaken as part of preparing this report:
•
the physical assessment of the landscape was conducted in a non-invasive manner 
(ie. photographs and observations only);
•
Indigenous cultural and social values attributed to Anzac Parade have not been 
researched;  and
•
the importance of Richard Clough in Australian history needs further research to help 
understand the value of his association with Anzac Parade under Criterion (h).
While not a limitation as such, it is worth stressing that this plan does not consider in detail 
every possible place of individual significance within the area, such as the many 
memorials.  The plan focuses on the overall place.  To the extent there may be components 
within the area with specific and individual values not related to the overall place, then 
these generally await more detailed study as part of some other conservation process.
This management plan conforms with the Burra Charter (Australia ICOMOS 2013) and 
there are no non-conforming aspects to note.

LOCATION AND DESCRIPTION
2.1
LOCATION AND BOUNDARIES
Anzac Parade is a relatively large area or corridor located on the north side of Lake Burley 
Griffin in the central part of Canberra.
The boundaries for this area are generally the whole of Anzac Parade, including Anzac 
Park, from Constitution Avenue to the block boundary of the Australian War Memorial.  
The Anzac Park East and Anzac Park West road reservations are not included, nor are 
respectively the eastern and western verges of the road reservations which are contiguous 
with Anzac Park.  Accordingly, while the verges appear to be part of Anzac Park when 
viewed on site, in fact they are not part of the National Heritage place.
A short section of Anzac Parade between Constitution Avenue and Parkes Way is also not 
included in the National Heritage listed area, and is not in the study area considered in this 
plan.  None the less, this section is considered as part of the setting for the place.
The blocks and sections included are:
•
Campbell, Section 1 and Block 2 Section 60;  and
•
Reid, Block 4 Section 39, and Section 41.
In addition, there are a number of road reservations included within the study area.
The contextual boundaries or the setting for the area are much larger and include:
•
the eastern and western verges respectively of the Anzac Park East and Anzac Park 
West road reservations;
•
the remainder of Anzac Parade between Constitution Avenue and Parkes Way, 
including Rond Pond;
•
Mount Ainslie as the forested backdrop to the Australian War Memorial and the 
northern terminal node of the Land Axis;
•
the remainder of the Land Axis to Capital Hill/new Parliament House, and Red Hill 
beyond, being the backdrop to the southern view along the Land Axis, and Red Hill 
as the near southern marker point of the axis (the axis extends much further south to 
Bimberi Peak);  and
•
the Central Basin of Lake Burley Griffin.
The implications of this setting are discussed later in this report.

2.2 DESCRIPTION AND CONDITION
This section begins with an overview of the Parliament House Vista, as the larger heritage 
landscape which includes Anzac Parade.  This is followed by a brief description of the 
broader landscape surrounding the Parade, and then information about the landscape and 
built components of Anzac Parade itself, including in particular the memorials.  The 
section concludes with general comments about the condition of Anzac Parade.
Overview of the Parliament House Vista
The Parliament House Vista area is a large, eccentrically shaped area.  The southern part is 
the triangular Parliamentary Zone (excluding new Parliament House), the central part is the 
Central Basin of Lake Burley Griffin and the fringing parks on the northern shore, and the 
northern part is the long thin strip of land about Anzac Parade which terminates in a 
roughly triangular area containing the Australian War Memorial.  The dominating 
landscape feature is the Land Axis running through all of these parts, and there is a broad 
symmetry to the area about the axis.
Figure 6.  Aerial view of the Parliament 
House Vista and environs with Anzac 
Parade highlighted
Source:  ACTmapi
The Land Axis is both a visual and physical element in the design of Canberra, and runs 
from Mount Bimberi in the Brindabella Ranges in the southwest to Mount Ainslie in the 
northeast. The Land axis within central Canberra is defined by tree plantations on either 
side of the land corridor and a central space with several different land surface treatments, 
and changes of level, to conceptually link Capital Hill with Mount Ainslie.
The surface treatment of the Land Axis within the Vista has been integrated into the 
different precincts, mostly grass or water, with the exception of the northern and southern 
foreshores of Lake Burley Griffin, and Anzac Parade.
The Land Axis corridor is most strongly defined as a formal landscape treatment in Anzac

Parade.
The Parliamentary Zone comprises a complex hierarchical landscape pattern of roads, 
mature trees and lawn areas, with major institutional and government office buildings, and 
gardens located as isolated features within the zone.  This part has a number of cross axes.
The broader landscape surrounding Anzac Parade
Anzac Parade sits within a larger landscape area or setting which is an important context 
for it.  This setting includes:
•
Mount Ainslie as the forested backdrop to the Australian War Memorial and the 
northern terminal node of the Land Axis;
•
the remainder of Anzac Parade between Constitution Avenue and Parkes Way, as 
well as the Rond Point;
•
Capital Hill/new Parliament House, and Red Hill beyond, being the backdrop to the 
southern view along the Land Axis, and Red Hill as the near and visible approximate 
southern nodal point of the axis (the axis extends much further south to Mount 
Bimberi);
•
expressed in another way, the whole of the Land Axis;
•
the suburban setting either side of the Parade;  and
•
in a general sense the whole former Molonglo River valley in the vicinity, especially 
the Central Basin of the lake.

Anzac Parade – National Heritage listed section
This northern part of the Land Axis, where it intersects with the upper slopes of the 
Molonglo River Valley, has been physically expressed through Charles Weston’s planting 
and pavement patterns since the early 1920s as Prospect Parkway and Place, and 
subsequently Anzac Parade in association with the siting of the Australian War Memorial.
Anzac Parade has a central paved median of red gravel (crushed brick) with formal, 
symmetrically located raised concrete planter boxes with Hebe species, which were re-
planted during 2012.  The median is broken in its length by an intersecting cross road.
On either side of the central avenue are three-lane bitumen-surfaced roads.  These are in 
turn flanked by a zone of irrigated grass defined by kerbing on the roadside and a parallel 
concrete path and retaining walls upslope.  The latter define the outermost zone of

Eucalyptus tree plantation (now roughly three rows) with a mulched understorey and 
patches of non-irrigated grass species.
Figure 8.  Anzac Parade from 
southwest

Rectangular areas of red gravel in the Anzac Park sections create cross axes, and mark an 
existing memorial or the site for a future memorial.
Anzac Parade has a strong relationship with the forecourt of the Australian War Memorial, 
outside the study area.
The treed plantation on either edge of the Land Axis reinforces the vista in both directions:  
to the northeast that of the Australian War Memorial set against Mount Ainslie;  and to the 
southwest a reflective sliver of Lake Burley Griffin, and the Parliamentary/ Government 
complex set against Red Hill, with the Brindabella Range and Mount Bimberi beyond.
The strong formality of the landscape of the Anzac Parade composition contrasts with 
some other areas in the central Canberra landscape.
The Parade is home to 13 memorials related to military service.  These are located within 
terraced niches or landscape rooms of varied treatment and composition formed within the 
tree plantations either side of the Parade, with most niches having a crushed brick paved 
area fronting the roadway.  The two memorials closest to the Australian War Memorial do 
not have such paved areas.  The existing memorials are described separately below.  In 
addition, there are two niches currently without memorials.
Anzac Parade contains a range of other built elements including:
•
the three-lane divided bitumen roadway of Anzac Parade, as well as the roundabout 
at the northeast end of the Parade, and cross road at the Blamey Crescent/Currong 
Street intersection;
•
gravel/crushed brick paved areas including the wide Anzac Parade median or central 
strip, central part of the roundabout, as well as at the entrances to most of the 
memorial niches;
•
raised concrete planter beds in the central median;
•
concrete footpaths along the Parade;
•
low concrete walls, some incorporating timber seating;
•
bronze signs set into the landscape in the vicinity of each memorial;
•
major modern decorative street lighting;  and
•
traffic lights as well as various street name, traffic and tourism direction signage.

Memorials
The following brief description of the 13 existing memorials has been drawn from the 
NCA’s website (www.nca.gov.au/anzac).
Australian Hellenic Memorial
The design includes a marble memorial which recalls the shape of an amphitheatre amidst 
an olive grove.  The Doric column symbolises the birth of civilisation.  This column is also 
embossed with the cross of the Greek Orthodox Church, representing a soldier's grave.  
The column stands on a mosaic pavement which represents the rugged coastline and terrain 
of the battlefields.  The damaged steel fragment reflects the futility and destruction of war.

Memorial

Australian Army National Memorial
The central focus of the memorial is two bronze figures representing Australian soldiers 
facing east towards the rising sun.  The figures stand on a raised podium paved in a radial 
pattern, which refers to the Army insignia.
Seven cylindrical pillars recall the seven major conflicts in which the Australian Army has 
been involved in the twentieth century.  The pillars stand in water, reminding the visitor of 
the long sea journeys involved in all Australian campaigns.

Australian National Korean War Memorial
The design characterises the period of the Korean War.  The use of white and grey tones in 
the memorial, and granite and gravel, recall the harsh climate and terrain in Korea – lasting 
impressions of those who fought there.
A central walkway leads to a semi-enclosed contemplative space.  A boulder from a 
Korean battlefield is a commemorative focal point and a word in Korean script represents 
'Peace and Independence'.  A scroll recognises the 21 countries that committed combat or 
medical units to the United Nations Command.  On both sides of the memorial are bronze 
figures representing the Australian sailors, soldiers and airmen who served in Korea.  
Battlefield boulders are set in fields of stainless steel poles which symbolise those who 
died.
The obelisk commemorates those who died with no known grave.  The inscription, taken 
from the United Nations Memorial Cemetery, Pusan, is a poignant link with the 
Australians who are buried there.

Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorial
Three concrete stelae, rising from a shallow moat, form the dramatic centre of the 
memorial and enclose a space for quiet contemplation.  Fixed to the inner right-hand wall 
are 33 inscriptions, a series of quotations intended to recall events of political, military and 
emotional importance.  The photograph etched into the rear wall shows Australian soldiers

waiting to be airlifted to Nui Dat after the completion of Operation Ulmarrah.  A 
suspended granite ring contains a scroll bearing the names of those Australians who died in 
the conflict.  Surrounding the memorial are six seats dedicated to the memory of the six 
Vietnam servicemen missing in action.

Desert Mounted Corps Memorial
The Desert Mounted Corps Memorial is a free-standing, cast bronze figurative sculpture, 
set on a granite base.  It depicts a mounted Australian Light Horseman defending a New 
Zealander who stands beside his wounded horse.

Boer War Memorial
Four bronze mounted horsemen in a stony landscape are the centrepiece of the artwork, 
posed dynamically and as if caught in a moment of the conflict.  Along the top of a blue-
copper commemorative wall are nine bronze replica journals, which are excerpts from 
letters detailing the experience of the Boer War as written by Private F H Booth, 2nd 
Victorian Mounted Rifles.  Another blue-copper wall provides a backdrop to the overall 
memorial.
New Zealand Memorial
The New Zealand Memorial is located on a pair of flanking sites at the southwestern 
(Constitution Avenue) end of Anzac Parade.
The design of the memorial consists of a bronze representation of the handles of a flax 
basket (kete harakeke).  They are 11 metres high and stretch as if to cross Anzac Parade.  
Woven flax is a particularly strong element in New Zealand culture.
The design is based on a traditional Maori proverb 'Mau tena kiwai o te kete, maku tenei' 
('each of us at a handle of the basket').  The proverb concerns sharing of responsibilities 
and joint effort to achieve a common goal.  The basket handles symbolise co-operation, 
mutual experiences and sharing the load.
At the base of each handle is a paved gathering space, which are landscaped areas with 
Maori and Aboriginal artworks.  On the western side of Anzac Parade is the Australian 
side of the Memorial.  The eastern side of the Memorial is the New Zealand side, and the 
paving design is based on the whakatu weaving pattern of a flax basket.
At the centre of the paving on each side is buried soil from Gallipoli, the birth of the 
ANZAC tradition, and the names of the campaigns where New Zealanders and Australians 
fought together are inscribed on the paving.

Australian Peacekeeping Memorial
This memorial commemorates the significant contribution made ‘in the service of peace’ 
by Australian peacekeepers – military, police and civilian – to United Nations and other 
international peacekeeping missions since 1947.
The design includes a Commemorative Beam that lists all Australian peacekeeping 
missions.  The beam sits at the back of a commemorative courtyard that includes

sentiments and phrases describing the characteristics of peacekeeping operations.  This 
courtyard is reached through a centrally lit passage between two tall, black monoliths.  
These represent the opposing factions and the passageway between is lit to reflect the 
peacekeepers who strive to bring these factions together.  Flags, symbols and explanatory 
plaques within the memorial explain and identify the contributors and characteristics of 
Australian peacekeeping.

Rats of Tobruk Memorial
The memorial takes the form of an obelisk.  Surrounding walls portray the perimeter 
defences and the design recalls the area in which the Tobruk siege took place.  The 
coastline and harbour are to the front and the defence positions flank the rear of the 
memorial.  The Eternal Flame is fabricated from bronze and was installed in 1984.

Royal Australian Air Force Memorial
The memorial honours those who have served in the RAAF throughout its history.  The 
memorial features three upsurging wing shapes in stainless steel representing the 
endurance, strength and courage of RAAF personnel.  The bronze flight image at the 
centre of the composition embodies the struggle to conquer the elements.  Inscribed on the 
plinth is the RAAF motto:  Per ardua ad astra – Through adversity to the stars.
Three black granite walls behind the three wings frame the sculpture, with images and the 
poem ‘High Flight’ by John Gillespie Macree Jnr inscribed on them.  Using archival

images the artwork depicts the dedication and valour of the men and women of RAAF who 
have served Australia, and traces the major war episodes from 1915 to the present.

Australian Service Nurses National Memorial
This memorial is made of cast glass.  Etched and cast into the inner glass walls are text and 
images, in a timeline sequence, portraying the history and contribution of Australian 
Service Nursing.  The memorial also includes a collage of historical photographs and 
extracts from diaries and letters, in the original handwriting.
Some panels are blank.  This is intentional, reminding visitors of the inconclusive nature of 
any memorial to an ongoing Service group.  The memorial is distinctly horizontal and the 
form of the interlocking glass walls represents nurturing hands, symbolic of nursing.  A 
contemplative space surrounded with rosemary for remembrance completes the memorial.
Among values reflected in the memorial are those of human dignity and worth, dedication 
in bringing succour and care, commitment beyond self, courage, companionship and 
fortitude.

Kemal Ataturk Memorial
The memorial consists of a crescent-shaped wall in a paved area, and five pillars, which 
reflect the crescent and star of the Turkish flag.  On the pillars are a series of interpretive 
panels outlining the Gallipoli campaign and the role of Ataturk.
Centrally located on the wall is a bronze likeness of Ataturk.  The inscription beneath – 
Ataturk’s own words – pays warm tribute to the Anzacs and reflects his understanding of 
the awful cost of war.
Soil from Anzac Cove at Gallipoli was placed beneath the dedication plaque in the centre 
of the circular pavement.  Surrounding the memorial are pine trees – Pinus halepensis – 
grown from seed collected from the Gallipoli 'lone pine'.

Condition of Anzac Parade – National Heritage listed section
This section provides information about the condition of the area, prior to consideration of 
the heritage significance of the place in the following chapters.  It provides a general 
overview impression about condition as assessed by the consultants.  Section 8.5 provides 
an analysis of condition and integrity related to the actual significance of the place.

The condition of Anzac Parade is generally fair to good, with the area being reasonably 
well maintained.  The trees are in fair to good condition overall, with a small number being 
in fair/poor or poor condition.  The understorey of native grasses is in variable condition, 
being poor where the tree canopy is heavy and competition is high.  More detail about the 
trees and grasses can be found in Section 8.5.
The Hebe plants ‘Otari Delight’ which were planted in 2011-12 to replace earlier plantings 
have failed to thrive because of several soil-borne diseases and other contributing factors.
A general issue with a number of the memorials on the eastern side of the Parade is the 
transparency of the landscape behind the memorials, allowing clear views of the adjacent 
single storey residential and especially the multi-storey buildings.  Such views distract 
from the memorials, and arise either because of weaknesses in the eucalypt plantation or 
other specific screen plantings associated with memorials.  This is an issue for the 
following memorials: New Zealand Memorial – eastern part, Australian Peacekeeping 
Memorial, Rats of Tobruk Memorial and Royal Australian Navy Memorial.

Other general issues include:
•
deterioration of bronze memorial identification signs;
•
timber seat paintwork deteriorated;
•
irrigated grass is patchy in places;
•
mulch cover is thin in places;  and
•
concrete joints sealant deteriorated.
The condition of the individual memorials has not been assessed or addressed in detail as 
part of this plan.  None the less, a number of observations were made as part of the general 
inspections of the place.  These observations are as follows:
•
Australian National Korean War Memorial – some dead plants/shrubs;
•
Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorial – minor damage to concrete ramp 
wall, broken granite paver;
•
Desert Mounted Corps Memorial – cracked, loose and missing slate pavers, rear 
drain blocked with leaf litter;
•
Boer War Memorial – minor cracking to the concrete paving;
•
New Zealand Memorial – in need of a minor tidy-up, removal of some weeds, and 
the recessed light pits cleaned out;

2.3 ASSOCIATED PLACES
Anzac Parade is associated with a number of overlapping places.
The National Heritage listed section of Anzac Parade is closely associated with the 
Australian War Memorial as the other component of the National Heritage place.
Anzac Parade is also associated with the Parliament House Vista, being part of the larger 
Commonwealth Heritage listed place.
The Parade is also part of the overall Land Axis.
In all of these cases, Anzac Parade has a strong and intimate association which is related to 
planning, landscape, views, history and social qualities.

OVERVIEW HISTORY
3.1 INTRODUCTION
This history is divided into two main parts which deal with the:
•
social, planning and political history of the study area after colonisation;  and
•
the landscape history of Anzac Parade.
The first section offers a narrative framework which deals with the major social, planning 
and political elements of the story, and the landscape history section then summarises the 
landscape dimension of that story.
While the social/planning/political history and the landscape history each have a different 
emphasis, there is a small measure of overlap between these sections.  This has been 
minimised but some remains in order to create linkages between these two aspects of the 
same overall story.
3.2 SOCIAL, PLANNING AND POLITICAL HISTORY AFTER EUROPEAN 
SETTLEMENT
Before Anzac Parade
Before the development of Canberra as the national capital, the area that was to become 
Anzac Parade was open paddocks on Robert Campbell’s ‘Duntroon’ property, with the St 
John’s Church and graveyard built in 1845 to the west, and the road from Scott’s crossing, 
on the Molonglo River, to Yass passing between St John’s and the back of what is now the 
western part of the New Zealand Memorial, crossing Anzac Parade south of the present 
Constitution Avenue intersection and running on through the Parkes Way intersection (see 
Figure 25 below).

One of the issues discussed at length during the Colonial conventions leading up to the 
Federation of the Australian colonies into the Commonwealth of Australia in 1901 was the 
matter of a national capital.  Many initially assumed that either Melbourne or Sydney, as 
the largest cities in the proposed nation, would become the capital.  The potential 
combination of economic and political power in one of the colonies, however, caused 
disquiet, and after much discussion, an inland site was specified in the Constitution for the 
new nation.
The basic decisions about who would choose the site, where the capital could be, and the 
nature of its land tenure, were embodied in Section 125 of the new Commonwealth 
Constitution,
‘The seat of Government of the Commonwealth shall be determined by the Parliament, and 
shall be within territory which shall have been granted to or acquired by the Commonwealth, 
and shall be vested in and belong to the Commonwealth, and shall be in the State of New 
South Wales, and be distant not less than one hundred miles from Sydney.
Such territory shall contain an area of not less than one hundred square miles, and such portion 
thereof as shall consist of Crown lands shall be granted to the Commonwealth without any 
payment therefor.  The Parliament shall sit at Melbourne until it meet at the seat of 
Government.’
In the early years of the new nation, politicians and the general populace lobbied for their 
suggestion of a location for the federal capital.  Albury, Armidale, Bombala, Canberra, 
Dalgety, Lake George, Lyndhurst, Orange, Tooma, Tumut and Yass-Canberra were all on 
the ballot taken in Parliament in October 1908, Yass-Canberra beating Bombala by 39 
votes to 33 (Pegrum 1983, pp. 137-138).
By 1911 the proposed location was firmly enough established to enable an international 
competition for the design of the new capital to be advertised.  The competition 
documentation included Scrivener’s survey maps and panoramic paintings of the Molonglo 
River valley.  The only spatial directive in the competition conditions was that the 
parliamentary building ‘should be so placed as to become a dominating feature of the city’.  
The ‘panoramic value of the city surrounds’ and the prospects for ‘ornamental water’ were 
mentioned but were not specific requirements (Freestone 2010, p. 96).

137 competition entries were received from around Australia and the world.  After a split 
decision by the Federal Capital Design Board, the Minister for Home Affairs, King 
O’Malley, followed the majority view and announced Walter Burley Griffin as the winner 
of the design competition for the federal capital.  Eliel Saarinen won second place and 
Alfred Agache third.
‘unlike other competitors, the Griffins did not treat the Limestone Plains as a blank space, but 
responded sensitively to the natural features, integrating topography into the design.  The plan 
was skilfully adapted to an ‘irregular amphitheatre’ rather than arbitrarily imposed on the site.  
As Peter Harrison observed, the ‘buildings are made important not so much by their size, 
height or architectural significance, but by their setting… it is not an architectural composition, 
but a landscape composition.’  (Freestone 2010, p. 96, quoting the Report of the Select 
Committee on the development of Canberra, 1955, p. 80)
Walter Burley Griffin’s winning design for Canberra, to an extent developed with Marion 
Mahony Griffin, had as its central geometric concept a triangle bisected by two axes at 
right angle, one being the Water Axis along his proposed lake, and the other the Land 
Axis, extending from Mount Ainslie through the apex of the triangle.  The alignment of the 
Land Axis north of the lake was to become Anzac Parade.  Griffin did not intend that the 
Land Axis should primarily be thoroughfares or roadways.  Rather, it was to form ‘a 
connected park or garden frontage for all the important structures’ (Griffin 1913, p. 5).
On the northern side of the future lake, Griffin envisaged that the Land Axis would be 
‘marked by a broad formal parkway to be maintained open in the centre and banked with 
foliage on the sides, setting off the residences’ (Griffin 1955, p. 98).  It was the landscape 
element rather than any thoroughfare that defined the Land Axis from the northern 
lakeshore to Mount Ainslie.  The Land Axis both north and south of the lake thus 
depended on correctly orientated buildings and plantings to give it definition.  (Marshall 
and others 2010b, vol. 1, pp. 50-51)

An historical appreciation of the plans for what became Anzac Parade is provided by 
Weirick,
‘possibly the most ambitious sequence of spatial and symbolic experiences was set out along 'Prospect 
Parkway' Griffin's term for that section of the Land Axis now known as Anzac Parade.  In Griffin's 
Canberra, this would have been the physical element which most dramatically linked the city's 
'National Capital' functions with the activities of everyday life.  Prospect Parkway extended from the 
National Stadium on the lakeshore, sited directly opposite the government buildings, to the forested 
slopes of Mount Ainslie.  Griffin described the Parkway as a 'formal plaisance' and Marion Mahony's 
perspective from the summit of Mt Ainslie clearly shows a sweep of space, lined on both sides by 
informal drifts of trees, which grade into formal avenue plantings.  Griffin's plaisance, a grand 
promenade under a canopy of trees, was a landscape element in the tradition of the Mall in Central 
Park or the Midway Plaisance on the south side of Chicago, both design [sic] by Frederick Law 
Olmsted.  Griffin's Plaisance, however, was not planned as a meeting place in a park but as a meeting 
place in the city, a green cross-section cut through a high-density residential district and directly 
accessible to all citizens in the Capital from the Prospect Parkway station, a stop on the city railway 
line, which was sited on axis but below grade.
Crowds of people could be expected to spill out of the Prospect Parkway station to attend sporting 
events in the National Stadium; to visit the opera, theatre or museums, to go shopping.  Residents in 
the nearby courtyard apartments could be expected to use Prospect Parkway as an urban park – a 
human scaled, modulated space under the canopy of trees, with an exhilarating prospect down the 
great sweep of its central greensward.  Griffin's plaisance was intended to be a natural funnel of 
activity, a vital place in the life of the city.  To walk along it, the central axis of the city, would be to 
experience transition from the public realm to the private realm…
To turn then from the set-piece, to leave the lake edge or the stadium, and walk along the plaisance 
would be to experience a series of transitions from the civic, formal and spectacular to the private, 
informal and relaxed…  To draw people to this upper end of the Mall [the plaisance], Griffin planned 
a Casino, a facility for popular entertainment and relaxation…’  (Weirick 1991, pp. 15-16)

The formal development of the Land Axis on the northern side of the Molonglo was, 
however, slow to start.  Griffin identified it as ‘Prospect Parkway’ on his later plans.  In 
1920 the construction of a railway line from Kingston to Civic passed across the alignment 
of Anzac Parade just south of the line of Amaroo Street (where it can still be made out on 
the northern edge of the current CIT grounds).  However, the line was short-lived, the 
bridge over the Molonglo River being washed away in a flood in 1922 and it was never 
replaced.  The longer-term plans to have the main-line railway from Queanbeyan run 
through Civic on its way to Yass were abandoned in 1924.
Following the First World War there was considerable support for the creation of a war 
memorial and museum in Canberra, and in 1923 the Federal Capital Advisory Committee 
(FCAC) was successful in getting government approval for the design of an Australian 
War Memorial on the site identified by Griffin for a Casino.  The Parliament House Vista 
heritage management plan claims that this decision ‘represented arguably the most 
fundamental change to the Griffins’ vision for what has become the Parliament House 
Vista’ (Marshall and others 2010b, vol. 1, p. 57).
‘In the Griffins’ scheme, the southern end of the axis was the site where the most important 
and serious business of the nation was conducted.  By contrast, the northern end of the axis 
was a place of relaxation and recreation.  The siting of the Australian War Memorial at the foot 
of Mount Ainslie changed the dynamic completely.  The northern end of the axis now became 
home to a matter of the utmost gravity and seriousness, the commemoration of the more than 
60,000 Australians who lost their lives in the First World War.  At the same time, the placing 
of the Australian War Memorial at the opposite end of the Land Axis to Parliament House 
elevated the commemoration of the war dead to a status rivalling that of the business of 
governing the nation.  The Griffins’ conception of the axis, with the levity of the northern end 
acting as a counterpoise to the seriousness of the other, was thus transformed…
Contrary to Griffin’s view of it as a pleasant parkway in a general recreational and residential 
area, Anzac Parade has become a place of much greater solemnity, a site for ceremony and in 
some eyes a sacred precinct.  While Walter Burley Griffin intended that the avenue would be 
lined by memorials, the presence of the War Memorial at the head of the avenue has led to the 
erection along it of memorials of a specific type – ones that commemorate men and women 
who served in wars.  These memorials, in turn, have reinforced the serious, sacral character of 
this part of the vista.’  (Marshall and others 2010b, vol. 1, pp. 57-58)
The construction of the Australian War Memorial was, however, delayed by the Great 
Depression and the commencement of World War 2, with the building not being opened 
until 1941.  The first memorial on what was is now Anzac Park was not erected until 1968.
In the meantime, in the 1920s Prospect Parkway (renamed Anzac Park in 1928) was laid 
out with formal plantings adjacent to the growing suburb of Reid, the intricate bedding 
being maintained until 1950 (Marshall and others 2010b, vol. 1, p. 87).  The extent to 
which these plantings by Charles Weston were in response to Griffin’s intentions for the 
parkway, and in what degree they were responding to later Departmental ideas, is not clear, 
though the former does seem likely, as the scale of the laid out beds precluded major road 
construction.  Weston was in charge of early government planting programs, and further 
information about his role is provided in Section 3.3 below.

Anzac Parade is developed as a memorial space
Anzac Park becomes Anzac Parade
In the 1960s, as the development of Canberra was accelerating, the National Capital 
Development Commission (NCDC), recognising the significance of the siting of the 
Australian War Memorial, drew up plans to make Anzac Parade a ‘processional way’ 
leading up to the Memorial.
Major earthworks were undertaken to level the sweep of the parade and establish two 
roadways separated by a broad median area, flanked on either side by a newly planted 
Anzac Park, and beyond these roads for local traffic.

Anzac Parade’s conversion into a processional way was completed and officially opened 
on 25 April 1965, the 50th anniversary of the World War 1 landings at Gallipoli.  The 
Parade was then increasingly used as the processional avenue leading to ceremonies at the 
Australian War Memorial, such as on Anzac Day.

Weston’s tree planting of the former Prospect Parkway was removed at this time and 
replaced with Eucalyptus bicostata on both sides of the Land Axis in the new Anzac Park.  
The central area was planted with Hebe species in regularly spaced raised planters formally 
located in a central band of red crushed brick gravel.  The choice of plants represented the 
Anzac spirit, symbolically linking New Zealand and Australia.  (Marshall and others 
2010b, vol. 1, pp. 69-72, 87)
While locations for future memorials were incorporated into the design of Anzac Parade, 
the first memorial appeared almost by accident.  During the Suez Crisis of 1956, an 
Egyptian mob in Port Said had badly damaged a memorial to those members of the 
Australian Light Horse Brigade, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles, the Imperial Camel 
Corps and the Australian Flying Corps who had lost their lives in the Middle East in World 
War 1.  Pressure from veterans groups to repair and bring the memorial back to Australia 
were successful, but the favoured location, Canberra, was replaced by Albany, the

departure point for the ANZAC troops.  Continued lobbying led to a decision to cast a 
copy from the original moulds which were held in Italy, for erection in Canberra, and this 
was unveiled on Anzac Parade by Prime Minister Gorton on 19 August 1968.  (National 
Heritage List citation;  Marshall and others 2010b, vol. 1, pp. 72-73)

The Rond Point pool and water jets, outside the National Heritage place, were built in 1963 
at the intersection of Anzac Parade and Parkes Way.  The Anzac Parade vista was 
accentuated in this period by the construction of the two monumental portal buildings on 
Constitution Avenue, aligned to the edge of the building development in Reid and 
Campbell.  Anzac Park East was completed in 1965 and Anzac Park West in 1967-68.  The 
Portal Buildings, first proposed by the Griffins, and in essence endorsed by the later 
important planning consultant for Canberra, Sir William Holford, framed the processional 
way to the Australian War Memorial, and gave a much greater measure of definition to the 
Land Axis.  (Marshall and others 2010b, vol. 1, pp. 73, 87)

Redesigning Anzac Parade
A redesign of Anzac Parade was proposed in the early 1990s, through the Anzac Parade 
Urban Design Competition.  The competition and the work of the four finalists was 
reported in Landscape Australia (Olsson 1992), offering an interesting perspective on the 
appreciation of the aesthetics and symbolism of Anzac Parade as interpreted by these 
teams of highly experienced Australian architects, landscape architects and other 
designers.
The brief given included addressing ‘the national significance of the site, given its 
symbolic importance in relation to the War Memorial and its axiality with Parliament 
House’ along with other factors such as the ‘continuity of the land axis’ and determining 
an ‘edge to the Parade within an urban setting that will endure’.
Following the Griffin concept, Anzac Parade was to be ‘the urban artefact which most 
clearly linked the National Capital functions to everyday life’ (Weirick quoted in Olsson 
1992, p. 50).  But in reality, Anzac Parade was becoming car dominated, severed from the 
lake by a parkway, the eucalypts were suffering dieback, and the design was not well 
terminated at the lake shore (Olsson 1992, p. 50).  Weirick also noted,
‘certainly one measure of our departure from his [Griffin’s] intentions is the total lack of people in 
Anzac Parade, the site of Griffin’s plaisance.  For some reason, it was deemed appropriate to repeat 
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

the desert-like emptiness of Anzac Parade in the desert-like forecourt of the New Parliament House.  
Emptiness, it seems, is central to the experience of Canberra.’  (Weirick 1991, p. 16)
The team lead by Daryl Jackson, competition winners, proposed the most radical 
treatment, adding a new structure into the landscape – a series of stepped parterres, and 
sought to shift the expressed symbolism from ‘remembrance and the War Memorial 
towards democratic constituency’ with each parterre representing an Australian state.  The 
trees were also proposed to change from eucalypt to liquidambar, a deciduous tree.  In this 
concept, the parade ground was removed, but the whole space was for use by pedestrians, 
freed of cars.
The other three finalists adopted a less interventionist approach.  One proposed a Peace 
Square and another a ‘Place of Great Australians’.  All more actively engaged the lake 
foreshore and sought to reduce in various ways the impact of traffic.  The three other 
responses all retained the ‘parade ground’, reinforced the plantings and increased the 
pedestrian qualities of the space, seeing no need to change too dramatically ‘an already 
memorable national artefact’.
Considering these responses, offered by significant Australian designers, the importance of 
Anzac Parade as a place that needs to be engaged with directly – to walk, look and reflect – 
comes through strongly.  It is a ‘view’ – the Land Axis – but it is also a place to be 
experienced (Olsson 1992, pp. 50-52).

Recent history
The original 1960s design for Anzac Parade included landscape rooms for eight 
memorials.  At some time, an additional eight landscape rooms were provided.
In 2001, an upgrade of Anzac Parade saw new, specially designed street lighting officially 
commissioned, replacing the original 1965 lighting.  The lighting was designed by 
architects Richard Johnson and Alec Tzannes, and the electrical and lighting consultant 
was Iain Clarke of Barry Webb & Associates.
On Anzac Day 2006 it was announced that the Australian War Memorial and Anzac 
parade would be added to the National Heritage List.

In 2008-2011 a major upgrade took place, with the roadways reconstructed along the full 
length of the Parade, and changes to the intersections at Limestone Avenue, Constitution 
Avenue and Parkes Way.
Around 2009 a process was begun to review the performance of the Hebe plants in the 
median planter beds.  This ultimately led to a decision to replace the plants, and to use a 
different cultivar of Hebe.  The replacement work was undertaken in 2011-12.

Other recent changes within the National Heritage place have included:
•
installation of traffic lights at the Blamey Crescent/Currong Street intersection with 
the Parade in about 2011;  and
•
a major project to core, compost and mulch the plantations in 2014.
Other recent changes outside the National Heritage place have included:
•
upgrading of Constitution Avenue, including the intersection with the Parade, in 
about 2011;
•
construction of medium-rise buildings on the corner of Anzac Park East and 
Constitution Avenue, from 2015;  and
•
demolition of the Anzac Park East building in 2019.

Thirteen memorials flank Anzac Parade, being set back into Anzac Park that runs each side 
of the Parade.  There remain two locations for future memorials, towards the northeast end 
of the Parade.  The memorials are as follows (see National Heritage List citation for the 
Australian War Memorial and the Memorial Parade;  Marshall and others 2010b).

Desert Mounted Corps Memorial (also known as the ‘Light Horse Memorial’, erected 
1968)
The sculpture by Raymond Ewers OAM is a replica of the original memorial designed by 
sculptor C Web Gilbert, and brought to fruition by Paul Montford and later Sir Bertram 
Mackennal, which stood at Port Said in Egypt.  The original was a memorial to those 
members of the Australian Light Horse Brigade, the New Zealand Mounted Rifles, the 
Imperial Camel Corps and the Australian Flying Corps who had lost their lives in the 
Middle East in World War 1.
The Port Said sculpture was attacked and smashed beyond repair during the Suez conflict 
in 1956.  Following lobbying by veterans, the remnants of the damaged memorial were 
later shipped to Australia where Raymond Ewers reconstructed the statuary.  The Ewers 
reconstruction was cast in bronze in Italy, and unveiled in Albany, WA, in 1964.  Albany 
was the place where ANZAC forces sailed from Australia.  Veterans associations, 
however, continued to press for the memorial to be placed in Canberra and, in March 1966, 
the government agreed to install a replica of the original memorial in Anzac Parade.  The

Boer War Memorial (erected 2017)
The memorial commemorates the military history of Australia during the Second Boer 
War (1899-1902).  The Australian Colonial Forces joined British forces in South Africa, 
united against the Dutch Afrikaner settlers known as Boers.  The area had been highly 
contested since the Napoleonic wars and when gold was discovered in the 1880s, 
hostilities broke out again.  By the end of the conflict, 23,000 Australians had served in the 
war.
The memorial was designed jointly by Pod Landscape Architecture and Jane Cavanough, 
and the sculptor was Louis Laumen.  The bronzes were cast by the Fundere Foundry in 
Melbourne.

3.3 LANDSCAPE HISTORY
Introduction
This section identifies a chronological series of significant phases or periods in the 
evolution of the cultural landscape of the study area, and provides a brief description of the 
landscape character of each period.  The periods nominated here simplify the underlying 
complexity of interaction between social and political struggles to establish the “bush” 
capital of Australia with its many, often competing, visions.
These periods represent the particular influence of individuals regarding the vision, 
planning, design, implementation and maintenance of the landscape.
The periods considered are:
•
Aboriginal occupation – ongoing Ngunnawal association;
•
colonial occupation – 1825–1900;
•
Federal Capital of Australia – 1901–1921;
•
Establishment:  Committees & Commissions – 1921–1956;
•
National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) – 1957–1989;
•

Aboriginal occupation
The Canberra region was occupied by three Aboriginal groups – the Ngarigo, the Walgalu 
and the Ngunnawal.  The Ngunnawal people are thought to have occupied Black 
Mountain, the adjoining Molonglo River flats and the Limestone Plains.  (Freeman 1996, 
p. 2)
The landscape character in this period may have changed through different climate 
changes over millennia with cycles of dry and wet periods.  The predominance of 
sclerophyllous vegetation such as eucalyptus open woodland and grassland at the time of 
European colonisation may have been associated with a dry cycle as well as the impact of 
the use of fire by Aboriginal people.  Vast stretches of open grassland existed on the plains 
with limited areas of treed vegetation above the winter frost line.
Aboriginal associations with the land are ongoing.
Colonial occupation 1825–1900
This period represents the beginning of European occupation of the study area in the 1820s 
with the use of sheep grazing on the natural grassland of the Limestone Plains.  The rural 
landscape character of this period gives emphasis to the concept of the later selection of 
Canberra (formerly Canberry Station and others) in the Federation period as the ‘Bush 
Capital’ reflecting national sentiment with rural Australia, and colonial conquest of the 
land.
In terms of a scientific description, the Limestone Plains are associated with a sedimentary 
geology of sand, gravel and clay overlying the Canberra Group of bedrock (shale, siltstone, 
limestone, sandstone, tuff and rhyolite).

The larger early land holdings were those occupied by Moore and Campbell, with most of 
the study area falling within Campbell’s ‘Pialigo’ land straddling both sides of the 
Molonglo River.
The land was largely cleared of indigenous treed vegetation and revealed a landform of 
gentle undulations with subtle drainage lines falling towards the Molonglo River.
The pastoral nature of the landscape of the area during the nineteenth century built upon 
the open woodland character, and further clearing to establish grazing.  In contrast to the 
open character of the valley floor and indigenous tree cover on the hills was the use of 
exotic vegetation to mark permanent colonial settlements.  This was an attempt to create 
comfortable microclimates for shade and shelter from westerly winds, as well as reference 
to the familiar forms associated with northern hemisphere environments.
The rural landscape in this period consisted of a patchwork of introduced and indigenous 
grasses, fenced paddocks in different states of cultivation according to the seasons (eg. 
wheat fields), dirt roads, homestead complexes with both indigenous trees and largely 
exotic plantations, and individual buildings such as shepherds’ huts and the conspicuous St 
John’s Church.  The Church grounds and surrounds contained contrasting vegetation and 
particularly conifers.
In the rural Limestone Plains of 1900, before the development of the national capital, a 
number of exotic plant species were established.  The tree species included English Elm, 
False acacia, Tree of Heaven, Lombardy Poplar, Silver Poplar, Weeping Willow, Basket 
Willow, Aleppo Pine, Stone Pine, Monterey Pine and Hawthorn.
The willows were conspicuously located along watercourses and the Molonglo River 
banks.  Pines were used as windbreaks and/or specimen plantings, as were the deciduous 
trees.  The poplars were used as markers throughout the local and surrounding rural 
landscapes to identify places of human habitation and activity.
These species were found to be successful due to their adaption to the climate, and 
particularly the limiting factor of frost and cold temperatures.
The tree planting that was carried out in the early years of the national capital built upon 
the existing successful species tried by the early settlers, as well as experiments with a 
range of exotic and indigenous species.
Federal Capital of Australia 1901–1921
This period includes the Federation of the former six colonies of Australia into one nation.  
It also includes the search, selection, planning, design and initial development of the 
national capital on the Limestone Plains, within a designated area of New South Wales – 
the Federal Capital Territory (later the Australian Capital Territory).
The Yass/Canberra district was considered as a candidate for the capital following the 
1901 meeting of the Congress of Engineers, Architects, Surveyors and others Interested in 
the Building of the Federal Capital of Australia.  In the following years, after a long and 
difficult process which included consideration of many other possible sites, Canberra was 
eventually selected, and it was surveyed in 1909.
The image of the future capital addressing a large water body was promoted by architect

uPage 
Robert Coulter’s 1901 visionary painting which depicted a proposed capital beside Lake 
George.
Another contributor to the Congress was Charles Bogue-Luffman, the first Director of 
Burnley College of Horticulture, Melbourne.  He put forward a paper describing the future 
capital city as one which could be integral with its ecological setting and that ‘the 
adaptation of streets and architecture to the natural contour and position of the landscape’ 
should be promoted such that the landscape be Australian in character, as opposed to a 
romantic/nostalgic interpretation of the northern hemisphere.
The site selected by the Federal Parliament was used in an international competition for the 
design of the capital in the same year (1911) that the area was named Canberra, after 
Canberry.
Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony Griffin won the design competition in 1912 and 
Walter accepted the position of Federal Capital Director of Design and Construction 
during his initial visit to Australia in 1913.  In May 1914 he returned to Australia with his 
wife Marion, after settling his American affairs, and set up offices in both Melbourne and 
Sydney.
With the establishment of Canberra as the site for the nation’s capital, arboriculture 
became a means of implementing planning and design concepts in a tangible way.
Charles Weston was appointed as Officer-in-Charge, Afforestation Branch, Federal Capital 
Territory and began service on 1 May 1913.  His previous appointments were as Gardener-
in-Charge at Admiralty House, Sydney, Head Gardener at the Federal Government House, 
Sydney, and the Superintendent of the Campbelltown State Nursery under the control of 
the Sydney Botanic Gardens.  Whilst at the Federal Government House, he made several 
visits to the Federal Capital site in 1911 and 1912 to assist in the establishment of a nursery 
at Acton.
Unlike the Griffins, Weston lived in Canberra, adjacent to the Acton Nursery, for most of 
his appointment, and he promoted the possibility of using a mixture of Australian trees and 
exotic trees that were frost tolerant.  His preference was for more coniferous species and 
particularly Cedrus species to, ‘form the chief arboreal feature of Canberra’.  His former 
employer, the Director of the Sydney Botanic Gardens, Joseph Henry Maiden, expressed 
the desire for the predominance of Australian trees, particularly eucalypts and the use of 
native grasses for the Federal Capital.  But Maiden could also see the attraction of using 
the Canberra climate to advantage by utilising autumn foliage plants as well as those plants 
which display distinctively coloured fruit.
The Griffins were also favouring the use of Australian plants, particularly eucalypts, and a 
mix of exotic trees and shrubs.  Maiden disapproved of the Griffins selected plant species 
except for a small number, and advised them to consult with Weston as, ‘the land in 
question is largely treeless with unknown sylvicultural conditions’.
The area now known as Anzac Parade was designated, in the Griffins’ competition entry, 
as the northern component of the Land Axis and as a parkway linking the foreshores of the 
intended central lake with an up-slope site for an intended casino building which would 
command views towards and over the Parliamentary Triangle on the opposite and southern 
shore of the central lake.  The parkway was a linear stretch of land lying along the axis and 
was identified as Prospect Parkway.

The Griffins’ vision for the parkway was,
‘a formal plaisance 600 feet wide, all the way to the Casino, a park feature, at the foot of Mt 
Ainslie.’  (Gray 1999, p. 183)
The perspective drawings prepared by Marion Mahony Griffin suggest a wide grassed area 
defined by rows of trees either side.  No detailed design drawings appear to have been 
developed by the Griffins for the Parkway but their intention was interpreted by Weston at 
a later date.
The 1911 competition drawings indicated a railway line set in a cutting crossing the 
parkway, together with a railway station.  The Commonwealth Railways preferred route 
was through the Canberra Gardens (now the Central Parklands) with a station centred 
across the Land Axis.  By 1916 the railway was relocated further south on the plan and 
closer to the intended Capital Terrace, with the station located off the axis and to the east.
Walter Burley Griffin’s position was abolished in 1920 and his contract as Director of 
Design and Construction ended on 31 December.  This followed a series of changes to the 
original competition design, initiated with the Departmental Board’s Plan in 1912, 
followed by Griffin’s response to both the site and the Board in amended plans of 1913, 
1915 and 1918.
Within each of the plans that evolved was the planning concept of a large roundabout 
located at the intersection of Canberra Avenue (now Limestone Avenue) and the Land 
Axis component of the parkway, in an attempt to resolve a series of issues – the potential 
traffic flow, the unresolved topographic form to match the intended geometry, and the 
impact of the deleted casino building.
The roundabout was identified in the 1915 plan as the ‘Market Park’ and later in 1925 as 
‘Prospect Place’.
The 1912 Board’s Plan had an associated perspective from Mount Russell, indicating the 
retention of the Griffins’ concept of the axial structure and, interestingly, the predominance 
of the use of fastigiated tree planting, possibly Lombardy Poplars or Roman Cypress 
planted at regular intervals and reinforcing the geometry of the road layout.  Griffin’s 
amended plans contained no such similar detail of landscape character but concentrated on 
the planning principles to achieve government acceptance over the influence of the Board.  
Changes of government and World War 1 hindered physical progress.

Establishment:  Committees & commissions 1921–1956
This period is concerned with the post-Griffin period, the establishment of the Federal 
Capital Advisory Committee (1921-1925), the Federal Capital Commission (1925-1930) 
and the National Capital Planning and Development Committee (1938-1957).
With the departure of Walter Burley Griffin, Charles Weston was made Director of City 
Planting.  The focus of planting was the National Triangle with planting of the alignment 
of Commonwealth Avenue and the projected foreshore planting of the future lake at the 
centre of the Water Axis.  Another focus was an area adjacent to Commonwealth Avenue 
conceived at this time as Central Park, that was to become Commonwealth Park in 1922.
In the following year further planting was carried out to define Capital Terrace 
(Constitution Avenue), and Prospect Parkway and Place (Anzac Parade).  This was an

uPage 
attempt to mark out the axial elements of Griffin’s concept and relied on closely spaced 
planting of lines of alternating species of predominantly advanced (11-13 years old) 
coniferous and oak trees, supplemented with Acacia species and roses.
Weston did not remodel the existing landform but planted rows of Cedrus atlantica and 
Quercus virens trees, within an established fenced area which ultimately obliterated the 
Griffins’ prospect concept by enclosing a chain of six separate grassed spaces, as opposed 
to a continuous central grass sward.
Further planting was carried out in the mid-1920s with some intricately shaped curved 
beds to areas between the separate grassed areas.  The additional horticultural 
embellishment appears to date from the decision to site a national war museum in place of 
the casino building.
In 1926 the Imperial War Graves Commission began sending packets of flower seeds from 
Australian soldiers’ graves overseas.  These were propagated by Weston for use near the 
war museum site, and ultimately within mass planting beds within the Prospect Parkway.  
(Gray 1999, pp. 183-4)
In November 1926, Weston retired.  His planting within the National Triangle was 
concerned with symmetrical compositions, mostly using coniferous tree species with some 
contrasting deciduous species and eucalypts, shrubbery, lawns and flower gardens.  He 
employed lines of row plantations often with alternating species, and a pattern of circles 
for formal statements for flower gardens (usually roses or tulips).  The density of planting 
was related to the sense of achieving an immediate effect, and the perceived need for 
creating windbreaks in an otherwise open and exposed landscape.
Weston’s successors as Director of Parks and Gardens were Alexander Bruce (1926-1938), 
John Hobday (1938-1944) and Lindsay Pryor (1944-1958).
Bruce continued to implement Weston’s planting yet added seasonal flowering plants such 
as Prunus trees and roses, whilst Pryor altered the Weston tradition in promoting the 
creation of parkland spaces for people, and the integration of eucalypts into the garden that 
Canberra had become.
By 1933, Prospect Parkway was designated as Anzac Park and seeds from war cemeteries 
in France and Gallipoli were received with the intention of continuing the planting within 
Anzac Park.  This appeared to continue until after World War 2 when the park layout was 
reconsidered and the former intricate flower beds were eliminated.
By 1938 the western arm of Canberra Avenue was renamed Gallipoli Avenue.
In November 1941 the Australian War Memorial was completed following a long design 
process.  This was initiated in 1919, followed by an architectural competition in 1927 in 
which no winner was selected, but two of the entrants, Emil Sodersten and John Crust were 
encouraged to submit a joint proposal.  The landscape setting for the schemes developed 
by Sodersten and Crust included the integration of the war memorial southern forecourt 
with what was to become Anzac Park.  Sodersten’s 1936 plan indicates the concept of a 
belt of trees framing the Land Axis, with the roundabout and the forecourt as one defining 
gesture.  This concept appears to have been developed by Richard Clough in the National 
Capital Development Commission in the 1960s.

Following the resignation of Sodersten in 1938, the landscape design for the war memorial 
setting was informed by Crust and Tom Parramore, a former student at Burnley School of 
Horticulture in Melbourne who had recently returned from working in England.  Parramore 
was recommended by Charles Bean, the journalist, war correspondent and historian who 
played a major role in promoting the development of the Australian War Memorial.  
Bean’s garden at Lindfield had been designed by Parramore in 1937.
The economic constraints during World War 2 resulted in a composition of terraces and a 
roadway to the front entrance of the Australian War Memorial, surrounded by lawns.

National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) 1957–1989
This period was one of great physical change through the latter half of the twentieth 
century, it was marked by the existence of the newly formed Commission with broad 
professional input, and highlighted by the completion of Lake Burley Griffin in 1963 
(although the lake was not filled until the following year).
The Commission in 1957 appointed Sir William Holford, a British Planner associated with 
University College London, to report on the future development of Canberra.  This report 
recommended that Canberra retain its Garden City concept, the city should be a cultural 
centre as well as a political one, and that implementation of the lake scheme in the 
Griffins’ plan would unify the city.
The Commission endorsed Holford’s recommendations adding a proposal for landscape 
development, the provision of parks and other recreational facilities.  The Commission also 
had built up a staff of planners, landscape architects, engineers and architects to liaise with 
consultants and evolve designs.  Richard Clough was appointed as an architect in the Town 
Planning section in 1958.  He had been a landscape student at University College London, 
he knew of both Holford and Dame Sylvia Crowe, and he worked on a coordinating 
committee between landscape, architectural and engineering issues.
Early in 1959 the Commission received an endorsement from the Government to proceed 
with the lakes scheme, without the proposed East Lake.  William Holford & Partners were 
engaged to make recommendations for the landscape treatment of the Central Basin of the 
lake, and this report was published by the NCDC in February 1961.  This report indicated 
the form of planting, treatment of lake margins, roadways and architectural features.  It 
further proposed that the length of the north bank between the two new bridge 
promontories (Commonwealth and Kings Avenue Bridges) should be informal except for 
the central section around the Land Axis.
Recommendations for planting included the use of the existing landscape colour on the

higher ground, with eucalypt planting being brought down from the surrounding hills 
through the built up areas into the parklands, with light green used for the lake margins and 
darker conifers for boundaries and backgrounds.  Autumn colour foliage plants were to be 
employed for formal and dramatic use.  Flowering trees and shrubs should be massed in 
small enclosures so as to allow the character of the natural landscape to predominate.
In 1963 the Landscape Division of the NCDC was established with Harry Oakman as 
Director.  He was followed in this role by Richard Clough in 1965 and John Gray in 1980.
Clough coordinated the landscape works and plantings for the north bank of the Central 
Basin, and the re-design of Anzac Park into Anzac Parade.
A main design approach to the Land Axis involved formal planting of various eucalypt 
species, which continued the concepts put forward generally by Lindsay Pryor.
The Rond Point Pool and water jets were built in 1963 at the intersection of Anzac Parade 
and Parkes Way.  Weston’s tree planting of the former Prospect Parkway and Anzac Park 
were removed at this time and replaced with Eucalyptus bicostata on both sides of the 
Land Axis, with the central area planted with Hebe species in regularly spaced raised 
planters formally located in a central band of red gravel (crushed brick).  The choice of 
plants was symbolic to both New Zealand and Australia, in an attempt to represent the 
ANZAC spirit in a formal manner.
It is worth noting that there seems to have been no symbolism attached in the design to the 
choice of red gravel.  A suggested association with bloodshed or blood sacrifice appears to 
have been a later development.
The re-design of Anzac Park into Anzac Parade was carried out by a collaboration of 
Richard Clough and Gareth Roberts in the NCDC, with input from Richard Gray and Bill 
Minty (lighting design).  Both Gray and Minty were employed by Holford.  The NCDC 
town planner Peter Harrison supported the concept as it interpreted Griffin’s Land Axis.
Both Clough and Roberts designed the forecourt to the Australian War Memorial to 
integrate with the treatment of Anzac Parade.  Their objectives were to unify the space and 
play down the main traffic intersection which was an inheritance from Walter Griffin.  A 
further complication was that the Remembrance Driveway terminated in a plantation of 
oak trees to the southeast of the Australian War Memorial.  The land sloped from east to 
west and was naturally out of balance for the intended formality, as the setting for the main 
façade of the Australian War Memorial.
A major decision in the design was to restore the prospect or line of sight along the Land 
Axis and to deal with the undulating topography.  Generally excavation was carried out on 
the Campbell side and fill placed on the Reid side.  The Australian War Memorial 
forecourt was also remodelled to create two angled fill landforms and planted with 
eucalypts.  An amphitheatre space was created by cutting the natural landform with 
symmetrical treatment of concrete seating, and central stairs leading to a central gravel 
paved gathering space.  The sloped landforms were grassed.  The proportions of the 
forecourt generated the overall proportions and layout of Anzac Parade.
The landform was regraded to create a continuous central space and the concept of others 
locating the roads in the centre was abandoned in favour of locating the roads to each side.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
The scale and proportion of the elongated central space was addressed by allowing the 
cross roads to break down the overall length into shorter sections.
The central area of the Parade between the roads was paved with red gravel which was 
actually crushed brick and tile, sourced by Rod Dalgliesh from the Yarralumla Brickworks.  
The red gravel was carried over to the central area of the Australian War Memorial 
forecourt, as well as placed in the centre of the roundabout.
Concrete paths were added to the side of the roads and a concrete edging, either 
freestanding or as a retaining wall which varied in height, negotiated the varying change of 
level in each section of the Parade sides.  Three rows of Eucalyptus bicostata (Eurrabie or 
Blue Gum) trees with an underplanting of Poa grasses were placed each side, beyond the 
line of the concrete retaining wall to further help define the central space whilst raised 
planter beds were placed either side of the central red gravel paved area.  The rectangular 
planter beds contained three sections of higher growing Hebe species and were surrounded 
by a lower growing species.
In addition, inter-plantings apparently of a cover species were used, possibly wattles.  The 
intention of inter-row plantings was to provide a quick-growing aesthetic plantation and 
nurse crop while the long-term species established, and being short-lived, the wattles 
would all be gone or removed by the time the long-term plantings were well established.
Lindsay Pryor and Ray Margules sourced all the plants for the original planting of Anzac 
Parade.  Margules selected all of the seeds for the eucalypts from one tree which were then 
propagated in a nursery.  Many of the eucalypts were root bound by the time of planting 
and this may have contributed to subsequent losses within the plantations.
Spaces were made available for future memorials, and the first memorial was the Desert 
Mounted Corps Memorial.
National Capital Planning Authority (NCPA) 1989–1997
In 1989 the National Capital Development Commission was replaced by the National 
Capital Planning Authority.
This period represents a change in responsibility for areas within the National Capital, the 
formation of the Australian Capital Territory Government responsible for Canberra and 
largely independent from the Commonwealth Government, and the establishment of the 
National Capital Planning Authority in early 1989 which was focussed on the significant 
core of the National Capital.  This core was the defined Central National Area with its 
character expressed as a cultural landscape, and there was an objective of enhancing the 
character of Canberra as the National Capital.
As such, the planning process was a continuation of the NCDC approach.  This involved 
enhancement through the implementation of projects falling within the Parliamentary 
Zone, as opposed to planning visions attempting to redefine the former Griffins’ Municipal 
Axis from Mount Vernon (Civic) to Mount Pleasant (Russell), and attempting to establish 
links from Constitution Avenue to the parkland edge of the lake.  New visions for Anzac 
Parade were also explored.

National Capital Authority (NCA) period 1997–present
This period is represented by a name change with the dropping of ‘Planning’ from the 
Authority’s title, with a greater focus on the Parliamentary Zone, and with a determination 
to make it a place for people relative to national identity.
The NCA has initiated a series of studies, conservation management plans and 
publications, and implemented works including the Anzac Parade upgrade in 2001.  The 
upgrade was largely concerned with the installation of new street lighting to the design of 
Barry Webb and Alexander Tzannes & Associates, as consultants to the NCA.  Also in this 
period additional buildings to the north of the Australian War Memorial complex were 
constructed by the Australian War Memorial.
Subsequent to the major landscape change in the 1960s, there have been rejuvenation or 
refurbishment phases of various scales and areas of the planted landscape, mainly 
including row inter-planting and trialling an understorey of native grasses within the 
plantations in 1995.

EVIDENCE OF COMMUNITY-BASED VALUES
4.1 INTRODUCTION
This section investigates the nature and scope of social and community aesthetic values, 
considering the National Heritage criteria and the indicators of significance defined for 
such assessments in the Guidelines for the assessment of places for the National Heritage 
List (Australian Heritage Council 2009).
It supplements the existing values assessed as part of the National Heritage listing of 
Anzac Parade, and draws on the assessments undertaken for the Parliament House Vista, a 
Commonwealth Heritage place (Marshall and others 2010b), the previous Australian War 
Memorial Heritage Management Plan (Godden Mackay Logan 2011, noting the current 
plan was not available until recently), Lake Burley Griffin and Adjacent Lands Heritage 
Management Plan (Godden Mackay Logan 2009), and other materials.
This section defines the associated communities and documents the research undertaken 
into these values as part of this plan.  The evidence is analysed against the two relevant 
criterion (in Chapter 6) and this contributes to the statement of significance (Chapter 7).
Understanding these community-based values is critical in the assessment of criteria (e) 
and (g), aesthetic and social significance – and these criteria place a specific emphasis on 
community associations and values.
It should be noted that this chapter derives from research undertaken for the 2013 version 
of the heritage management plan.
Indigenous cultural and social values attributed to Anzac Parade have not been researched.
4.2 REVIEW OF EXISTING DATA
This section looks at the existing data on social and community aesthetic values from 
previous studies and other sources.  Existing research and assessments have provided a 
foundation for the present plan, and provided a substantial amount of data on social and 
community-held aesthetic values.
As well, through the review and analysis of this material, the consultants were able to:
•
identify the communities and cultural groups that may value Anzac Parade highly 
because of its strong or special associations for their community or cultural group;  
and
•
generate key questions for exploration with each community or cultural group, or 
with representatives of, or suitable surrogates for, that group.

interviews.  The Parliament House Vista area stretches from State Circle to the Australian 
War Memorial, including the core of the Land Axis.
The plan offers considerable detail on the perceptions and values associated with the 
Parliament House Vista, some of which are directly relevant to Anzac Parade.
The on-line survey, primarily completed by Canberra residents, demonstrated the 
importance of the Vista for a variety of reasons including as ‘a place that connects 
Australian’s political history from past to present’, as a place that ‘evokes national 
memories’, as a place where people can participate in ‘important national events’, as a 
‘dramatic and powerful landscape’, and as an ‘important symbol of Australian national 
identity’.  The symbolism embodied in this place is strongly recognised and deeply felt, as 
are its beauty and design qualities (Marshall and others 2010b, vol. 1, pp. 102-103).
In the focus groups it was recognised that the Vista is ‘a significant place in terms of its 
design, symbolism and its role in Australian national memory and identity-building’, 
although these values were seen as being primarily appreciated by the Canberra 
community rather than Australians as a whole (Marshall and others 2010b, vol. 1, p. 105).
An examination of images used to present Canberra to visitors (eg. postcards, tourism 
guides and materials) noted that views along the Land Axis dominated, looking to 
Parliament House or the Australian War Memorial, and indicating its high level of 
recognition as Canberra’s signature or icon.
Delving further into the values expressed, the plan recognises that for the Canberra 
community the Vista is ‘a special place which they see as at the heart of Australian 
national identity and what it is to be Australian’, symbolising ‘commemoration, 
democracy, national memory and history and is an iconic representation of Canberra’.  
Further it ‘gives them a real sense of their place in Australian history and engenders in 
them a sense of pride’ (Marshall and others 2010b, vol. 1, p. 112).
As well as the symbolic meanings embodied in the landscape, the Vista is important for its 
beauty and design qualities,
‘the corridor from Parliament House to Mount Ainslie is a beautiful space’
‘it is a striking design element of the city linking (aesthetically and philosophically) key public 
buildings and facilities that are central to the identity of modern Australia’  (Marshall and 
others 2010b, vol. 1, p. 113)
As a designed space, it is valued as part of the Griffins design for Canberra,
‘The vista encompasses the legislative, judicial and social structures that represent our nation.  
These need a strong landscape to link them and present a good image of the heart of our nation 
to the nation and the world.’  (Marshall and others 2010b, vol. 1, p. 113)
The scale and formality of the Vista is recognised as contributing to its overall impact,
‘I find the scale very impressive, the corridor from Parliament House to Mount Ainslie is a 
beautiful space.  I admire the orderly (formal) landscaping that slashes through the ‘natural 
bush’ on the perimeter, the contrast is spectacular.’
‘It’s the central concept of the Griffins’ design.  The dimensions of Anzac Parade and the War 
Memorial can be appreciated from Parliament House’

‘I think the view is breathtaking and I am very touched seeing passed the Old Parliament 
House all the way to the War Memorial’  (Marshall and others 2010b, vol. 1, pp. 114, 119)
The sightline from Parliament House to the Australian War Memorial was identified as 
important by 66% of respondents to the on-line survey.  This sightline offers a visual 
unification of the ideal of democracy and the sacrifices made to protect the values of 
democracy, and the plan concludes that it is the veterans/family of veterans among the 
Canberra community who are most likely to hold this view.  Some examples quoted from 
the on-line survey include,
‘Visual link from Parliament House to the War Memorial links our democracy with the 
sacrifices made to achieve and maintain it.’  (Canberra resident and veteran/family of veteran)
‘Visual impact, particularly looking south towards Old Parliament House and north from the 
lake shore towards the war memorial.’  (Canberra resident and veteran/family of veteran)
‘It is an inspiring view to link the parliament and its democratic heritage with the war 
memorial and its commemoration of those who have fought and died to preserve it.’   
(Canberra resident)
‘The vista encompasses the legislative, judicial and social structures that represent our nation.  
These need a strong landscape to link them.’  (Canberra resident)
‘At one end is the War Memorial which is where the Australian identity was first forged in 
popular culture.’  (Canberra resident and veteran/family of veteran)
‘The significance of the vista is also because of the later alterations and additional cultural 
buildings that now form part of the area, including Old Parliament House, which is a physical 
legacy of the fledgling Commonwealth Government from the 1920s and a national icon that 
reveals so much about Australian Political life in the 20th century.  The vista visually connects 
the evolution of Australian Government and the democracy between the old and new 
parliament building, and celebrates the cultural identity of the nation through the linkages to 
the National War Memorial and other important buildings.’  (Visitor)  (Marshall and others 
2010b, vol. 1, pp. 119-120)
Australians’ perceptions of their National Capital
A national survey undertaken in 2006 sought to understand Australians’ perceptions and 
attitudes to Canberra as the national capital.  The sample covered 1,002 Australians, and 
nearly 76% of the sample had visited Canberra.
The most highly ranked symbols of Canberra were Parliament House and the Australian 
War Memorial.  The national values represented by Canberra were, in the eyes of 
respondents, that it reflects Australia’s history, Australian democracy and national values, 
with a high percentage supporting the idea that the national capital should be something 
Australians are proud of (91.6%) and that it should symbolise Australians’ ideals and 
aspirations (83.7%).  The national values identified were ‘in particular Australia’s defence 
force history, democracy and Australian history’ (Marillanca 2005).
Lake Burley Griffin and Adjacent Lands Heritage Management Plan
This plan by Godden Mackay Logan (2009) for the NCA included an assessment of social 
and community-held aesthetic values, based on focus groups, an on-line survey, interviews 
and research.
The statement of significance for Lake Burley Griffin notes that,
‘Lake Burley Griffin is an essential part of what defines Canberra.  It is an essential component 
of the Griffin plan for a lake to link and unify the axes and vistas of the plan to the underlying 
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

landform of the place.  The lake is a unique and creative aspect of Australia’s most successful 
urban plan, which is highly valued by communities for its aesthetic qualities...  The lake is 
valued highly by communities for its landmark value, as a symbol of Canberra and as an iconic 
cultural landscape, which for many is a symbol of local identity.’  (GML 2009b, p. 2)
The strongest recognised values in this plan where there is a link to the potential values of 
Anzac Parade are:
•
valuing of the overall Griffin design concept for Canberra as an important part of the 
city’s identity, recognising that the Land and Water Axes have an important 
relationship to each other in the overall conception of the city;  and
•
recognising these design elements as part of the symbolism of Canberra—as national 
capital, and such symbols are regarded with pride by Canberra residents.  For 
example, Lake Burley Griffin was noted as the ‘primary focus and feature of 
Canberra equal to the War Memorial and Parliament House’ by one respondent 
(GML 2009b, p. 127).
The lake itself is an important viewing point within the city,
‘It is amazing that you can sit on the water in the Central Basin and have a view from the War 
Memorial through to Parliament House.  It is very special.  The whole foreshore is superb 
particularly as it is not cluttered with buildings and you get such a feeling of space.’  
(Questionnaire ID 2714, GML 2009b, p. 132)
The formality and symmetry of the Central Basin and Land/Water Axes were strongly 
recognised aesthetic attributes by Canberrans, with the lake and its enclosing parklands 
bringing a sense of visual unity (GML 2009b, p. 137).
The plan concludes that Lake Burley Griffin is a valued aesthetic resource to the 
communities outside of Canberra, offering a valued setting to national institutions and 
reflecting the visual qualities of surrounding landscapes in its waters (GML 2009b, p. 181).  
It plays an important role in representing the image of Canberra to the nation – and 
potentially internationally.  Its symbolic and landmark value as part of the national 
capital’s landscape is well recognised and widely valued.  For Australians, especially those 
who have visited Canberra, Lake Burley Griffin is a well-recognised symbol of Canberra, 
forming the centre point of the national capital designed landscape (GML 2009b, pp. 184-
5).
For Canberra residents, ‘the integrity of the Griffin land/water axis and associated lands 
(Mount Ainslie, Black Mountain, Parliament House Vista etc)’ is vitally important and 
strongly recognised (GML 2009b, p. 182).
Perceptions research on Lake Burley Griffin
The ACT National Trust (Pipitone 2009) undertook a study of the social value of Lake 
Burley Griffin, using a detailed on-line survey.  The study was designed to understand how 
the Canberra community use and value Lake Burley Griffin.  A detailed analysis of the 
results enabled conclusions to be drawn about the importance of different parts of the lake, 
including views and vistas.
The survey was open to the Canberra community and there was no targeted sampling 
involved – 758 people responded to the survey.  The survey sample was slightly older than 
the Canberra population, with people under 34 significantly under-represented and those 
over 55 significantly over-represented.  This may reflect the age of the membership base of 
the initiating organisation.  Pipitone (2009, p. 6) concluded that the sample size is 
sufficient to interpret the results for all age groups except for 12-24 and 75+.

The view from Parkes Way to the Australian War Memorial and along Anzac Parade was 
concluded to be the second most important view to the people of Canberra, out of 60 views 
tested in the survey.  The views assessed were from the Lake, and therefore a view down 
the length of the Land Axis from either end was not included.
Views were the main reason for visiting places around Lake Burley Griffin and the main 
characteristic of places which people liked (Pipitone 2009, p. 52).
The two most highly regarded views and six other views in the top 15 views were of 
national icons or were heavily influenced by national icons.  From this Pipitone concluded 
that ‘Canberra people are very aware of the national icons that surround their everyday 
lives’ (Pipitone 2009, pp. 52 & 78).
Assessment of the Australian War Memorial and Anzac Parade
Commonwealth Heritage Listing
The Commonwealth Heritage listing for the Australian War Memorial describes it in the 
statement of significance as,
‘Australia’s National Shrine to those Australians who lost their lives and suffered as a result of 
war [and]…  As such it is important to the Australian community as a whole and has special 
associations with veterans and their families and descendants of those who fought in war.’
Aesthetically, the values of the Memorial relate to its ‘landmark qualities’.  Being on the 
Land Axis it makes a ‘major contribution to the principal views from both Parliament 
Houses’ (Australian Heritage Database, ‘Australian War Memorial’ ID 105469, 
http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/ahdb/search.pl, accessed 14 Mar 2011).
The Parliament House Vista is also on the Commonwealth Heritage List (AHD, 
‘Parliament House Vista’ ID 105466, http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-
bin/ahdb/search.pl, accessed 17 Nov 2011), and the listing recognises the values of Anzac 
Parade as,
‘Memorial features include sculptures, plaques, commemorative trees, water features and 
gardens.  The collection of sculptures, associated art and design which comprise the Anzac 
Parade Memorials, give expression to key aspects of the history of Australia's armed forces and 
Australia's war involvement, and possess high social value’ (Criterion G.1, Australian Historic 
Themes 8.8 Remembering the fallen, 8.9 Commemorating significant events and people).

The landscape spaces are important for social activities of visitors and Canberra residents and 
these include Canberra festivals, water events, national events and parades such as Anzac Day 
Parade and the Dawn Service, and other commemorative services’  (Criterion G.1)
National Heritage Listing
The National Heritage Listing is for the Australian War Memorial and the ‘Memorial 
Parade’ (AHD, ID 105889, http://www.environment.gov.au/cgi-bin/ahdb/search.pl, 
accessed 14/9/2011).  The statement of significance includes additional expressions of the 
values of the place, some related specifically to Anzac Parade as a place, and as a venue 
for significant events.
The statement of significance contains the following expressions of social significance 
(criterion g),
‘The Australian War Memorial (AWM) is Australia's national shrine to those Australians who 
lost their lives and suffered as a result of war.  As such it is important to the Australian 
community as a whole and has special associations with veterans and their families including 
the Returned & Services League of Australia.  These special associations are reinforced on 
ANZAC Day and at ceremonies specific to particular memorials on Anzac Parade.
The AWM and Anzac Parade have special associations with Australia’s military forces and 
with veterans as represented by the Returned & Services League of Australia and community 
groups.  Anzac Parade was opened on ANZAC Day 1965, the fiftieth anniversary of the 
landing of the ANZAC's at Gallipoli.  It is the setting for a series of memorials 
commemorating Australian service and sacrifice in war and is the major national venue for the 
ANZAC Day march and other ceremonies to commemorate those who served Australia in 
times of conflict.
Anzac Parade, as part of the Parliamentary Vista and as an extension of the AWM, has a deep 
symbolism for many Australians, and has become part of one of the major cultural landscapes 
of Australia.  The notion of a ceremonial space of this grandeur is not found elsewhere in 
Australia and Anzac Parade is nationally important for its public and commemorative 
functions.’  (Emphasis added)
The ‘official values’ under criterion (g) are given in the Australian Heritage Database 
citation as,
‘The AWM is the national war museum and national shrine, and together with Anzac Park, has 
special associations for the Australian community, particularly veterans and their families.  
These special associations are reinforced on ANZAC Day and at ceremonies specific to 
particular memorials on Anzac Parade.  The AWM and the Anzac Parade memorials are the 
nation’s major focal point for commemoration including the ANZAC Day march and other 
ceremonies and events.  These values are expressed through: the AWM building (including the 
Hall of Memory);  the collection;  the surrounding landscape (including the Sculpture Garden);  
and Anzac Parade including the memorials.’  (Emphasis added)
Its community-held aesthetic values are reflected in the ‘official values’ under criterion (e),
‘The AWM in its setting is of outstanding importance for its aesthetic characteristics, valued as 
a place of great beauty by the Australian community and veteran groups (as represented by the 
Returned & Services League of Australia).  The place has evoked strong emotional and artistic 
responses from Australian and overseas visitors.  The main building and the surrounding 
landscape, the Hall of Memory, the Roll of Honour, ANZAC Hall and the collections act as 
reminders of important events and people in Australia's history and trigger disturbing and 
poignant responses from the vast majority of visitors.’
‘The AWM together with Anzac Parade form an important national landmark that is highly 
valued by the Australian community.  As part of the Parliamentary Vista, the AWM makes a

major contribution to the principal views from both Parliament Houses and Mount Ainslie.  
Views from Anzac Parade to the Hall of Memory, and from the Hall of Memory along the land 
axis are outstanding.’  (Emphasis added)
ACT Interim Heritage Places Register
A citation for Anzac Parade, Park and Memorials, recognises that the place expresses two 
key themes – the Land Axis and the Australian Armed Service Tradition.  These themes 
are of interest in defining the associated communities in the present project (ACT Heritage 
1998).
The extent of Anzac Parade is defined as from Limestone Avenue/Fairbairn Avenue to the 
Rond Point wall, whereas the extent being considered in the present assessment is to 
Constitution Avenue only.
In the description, it is noted that Anzac Parade is ‘associated with the Australian Armed 
Service Tradition’, and is ‘associated with the Anzac Day march and memorial service and 
is the setting for the larger individual services held periodically at individual memorials’ 
(ACT Heritage 1998, p. 3).
The statement of significance notes, amongst other things,
‘The vista down the Parade is among the most recognised images of Canberra...’
‘These elements together with the collection of memorials, sculpture associated art and design 
give expression to key aspects of the history, tradition and ceremony of Australia’s armed 
forces and possess high social value.’
In relation to the Land Axis theme, the analysis notes that,
‘The view from the War Memorial is widely recognised as one of the classic views of 
Canberra... with the War Memorial in the foreground, (the view) is dominated by Anzac 
Parade and channelled through the portal buildings of the Anzac Park offices to terminate at 
Parliament House.’  (ACT Heritage 1998, p. 3)
‘Its vista, linking the Memorial with Parliament House, adds aesthetic and emotional value to 
the places which has become one of the major cultural landscapes of Australia.’  (ACT 
Heritage 1998, p. 5)
In relation to the Australian Armed Service Tradition theme, the analysis notes that the,
‘Entire length of the precinct is associated with Australian Armed Services tradition... the 
memorials all pertain to elements of the Australian Armed Services... Anzac Parade is 
associated with the Anzac Day march and memorial service and is the setting for the larger 
individual services held periodically at individual memorials.’  (ACT Heritage 1998, p. 3)
The formal ceremonial route of Anzac Parade creates the visual Land Axis link between 
the Australian War Memorial and Parliament House – described as ‘a space unlike any 
other in Australia’.  Its national symbolic importance is indicated by ‘the opening of Anzac 
Parade by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth on Anzac Day 1965’ and by the use of Anzac 
Parade as ‘the major national venue for the Anzac Day March and other ceremonies to 
commemorate those who served Australia in times of conflict, and it has a deep symbolism 
for many Australians’.  ‘The notion of a ceremonial space of this grandeur is not found 
elsewhere in Australia.’  (ACT Heritage 1998, p. 5)
The statement of significance recognises Anzac Parade as of aesthetic significance to all 
Australians,
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
‘The Parade is valued by all Australians for its contribution to the monumental vista of the 
National Triangle and its part in a significant cultural landscape of Australia.  Its contribution 
to the design of the nation's capital is also significant.’
Its social significance is considered in two parts.  Its significance to the majority of 
Australians,
‘Anzac Parade holds a spiritual significance for the majority of Australians, especially those 
who have been affected by war or conflict, including the Returned and Services League.’
And further it recognises its social significance for those with armed services connections 
as,
‘The memorials and landscaping have special sense of meaning for those involved in particular 
campaigns or those belonging to a particular armed service’  (ACT Heritage 1998, p. 11)

4.3 ENGAGEMENT WITH ASSOCIATED COMMUNITIES
Defining associated communities
Central to assessing social and community-held aesthetic values is defining the 
communities who hold those values.  The approach adopted was based on analysis of 
previous studies and other data, and the expectation that an associated community would 
have direct experience of the place.  Given the nature of this place, this could occur 
through their experience of Anzac Parade as:
•
a visitor;
•
a participant in ceremonies;
•
an audience member for ceremonies;
•
a designer or creator or interpreter of this place in whole or part;  and
•
as an advocate for the creation of a specific memorial.
Others may feel a strong connection with this place because of a personal connection 
without having any experience of the place.  This could include those with:
•
a direct personal connection to the events commemorated here (eg. past or present 
service personnel);  and
•
a direct connection to a family member or ancestor associated with the events held 
here.
Last but not least, this place is part of a cultural landscape with national symbolic 
meanings, suggesting that all Australians may feel a connection, no matter whether they 
have visited or witnessed a public occasion here.
Recognising that each associated community may value this place for different reasons and 
may attribute values to different aspects of the place, care is needed in defining associated 
communities.
Three potentially associated communities were broadly defined as:
•
Australians;
•
the Canberra community;  and
•
the armed services community – including the Defence forces, service personnel 
(serving and retired), service families, service organisations, and others with 
particular connections to the memorials on/in Anzac Parade/Park.
Perspectives from representatives of two other nations, New Zealand and Greece, were 
also gained through interviews.
Based on this set of associated communities and considering the previous research and 
assessments reported above, possible methods for researching the values of each 
community were defined and assessed against the project scope and resources.
Methods and Results
The table below summarises the research methods that were used with each defined 
community.  The following section then details the research undertaken and the 
conclusions reached.

The significance of Anzac Parade for Australians was derived from:
•
earlier work undertaken on social and community aesthetic significance for the 
Parliament House Vista (Marshall and others 2010b) and Lake Burley Griffin 
(Godden Mackay Logan 2009);
•
published materials, including website information;  and
•
an art and literature review (see Section 4.4).
Canberra community
The significance of Anzac Parade for the Canberra community was derived from:
•
earlier work undertaken on social and community aesthetic significance for the 
Parliament House Vista (Marshall and others 2010b) and Lake Burley Griffin 
(Godden Mackay Logan 2009);
•
published materials, including website information;
•
an art and literature review (see Section 4.4);  and
•
focus groups, given that all those attending had medium to long-term Canberra 
connections.
The Canberra community has strong connections to the armed services because of its role 
as the national capital, as home to the highest echelons and headquarters of the Defence 
forces, and as the location of the Royal Military College, Duntroon, and the Australian 
Defence Force Academy, national military training colleges which opened in 1911 and 
1986 respectively.1
Given the debate at the time of the research over new memorials in Canberra, the website 
Lake War Memorials Forum (now archived at https://webarchive.nla.gov.au/tep/157452) 
was reviewed to discern any expressed sentiments about memorials and Anzac Parade, but 
not the debate itself.  Also submissions to the Parliamentary inquiry into the Canberra 
National Memorials Committee 
(https://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House_of_Representatives_
Committees?url=ncet/memorials/index.htm) were examined seeking any relevant material.
Armed services community
The significance of Anzac Parade for the Armed services community was derived from:
•
focus groups and interviews;  and
•
published materials, including website information.
1 Duntroon is for the Australian Army.  The Royal Australian Naval College is located at Jervis Bay, 
and the RAAF College was at Point Cook, but is now in several locations including Wagga Wagga, 
Sale and RAAF Williams.

To some extent the views expressed by those with armed service associations reflects the 
views of part of the Australian community as well as the Canberra community.
At the time of this research, around 2011-12, the National Capital Authority contacted the 
three Defence services seeking a contact person to enable each organisation to contribute, 
however no response was received.
Using contact lists provided by the NCA, and derived from recent past events held in 
Anzac Parade, contact was sought with the following key organisations to gain their 
participation in the investigation, either through participation in a focus group or interview.
Two focus groups were held on 12 October 2011 in Canberra, and four interviews were 
undertaken by phone or in person as indicated below.  Two of the interviews reflected on 
the importance of Anzac Parade and the memorials from an international perspective.
The following table indicates those organisations that were invited to participate, those that 
did, and in what form.

4.4 REVIEW OF ARTISTIC AND CREATIVE SOURCES
Scope
This section is based on work undertaken by Dr David Young and provides a review of the 
visual art, literature and photography that feature Anzac Parade since the axis of the Parade 
was first included in the 1911 design for Canberra by Walter Burley Griffin.  It has been 
briefly updated given the presence of two additional memorials from 2017.
It also considers public representations of Anzac Parade, that is snapshots posted on four 
photo websites.
Memorials
Along both sides of Anzac Parade are 13 memorials dedicated to specific aspects of armed 
conflicts in which Australia has been involved – there are also two vacant niches that in 
time will be the sites of additional memorials.
Both Anzac Parade itself and the specific memorials have been interpreted by other artists, 
notably photographers, and this will be addressed below.
A number of the memorials were designed by leading artists, often in association with 
architects and other design professionals.  A list of the memorials and a discussion of the 
artists and designers involved is provided below.  The status of the artists and designers 
and the care and detailed attention that goes into the design brief and reviews, is an 
important indicator of the status of this place.
The memorials, individually and as a collection, are closely associated with Anzac Parade 
both geographically and contextually, and contribute to its aesthetic values.

Desert 
Mounted 
Corps 
Memorial
The Desert Mounted Corps Memorial was originally erected in Port Said, Egypt, in 1932.  
It was partly destroyed during the Suez conflict of 1956.  In 1964 a replica was made by 
Ray Ewers OAM and erected in Albany, WA, the port from which troopships left for 
Europe in WWI.  A second copy was made and unveiled in Anzac Parade on 19 April 
1968.
Three sculptors had a hand in casting the original statue.  C Web Gilbert won the design 
competition in 1923.  He died before he was able to finish the monument.  Some sources 
say the immensity of the task and Gilbert’s inexperience broke his heart and his spirit.  
Paul Montford, a leading British sculptor, then worked on the sculpture for some time 
before it was passed on to another Australian, Sir Bertram Mackennal.  Mackennal had a 
team of British assistants to help him but died before it was unveiled (Info Barrel, ‘The 
Desert Mounted Corps Memorial – WA’, 
www.infobarrel.com/The_Desert_Mounted_Corps_Memorial_-
Western_Australia#axzz1b1IaxCju, accessed October 2011, site active 4 August 2022).  
Ray Ewers (1917-1998) was an Australian war artist during WWII.  He produced 32 
dioramas of war scenes and 22 statues at the AWM until the 1960s (Wikipedia, ‘Raymond 
Boultwood Ewers, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Boultwood_Ewers, accessed October

Boer War 
Memorial
Dedicated on 31 May 2017, the Boer War Memorial was designed jointly by Pod 
Landscape Architecture and Jane Cavanough, and the sculptor was Louis Laumen.  
Cavanough has qualifications in both landscape architecture and the visual arts, and 
designs site specific public art.  She has achieved some success in competitions.  Laumen 
is a Melbourne-based sculptor born in the Netherlands.  He has qualifications in fine arts 
and has been responsible for numerous commissions, and has otherwise been a finalist in 
several competitions, sometimes as part of design teams.
New 
Zealand 
Memorial
Dedicated on 24 April 2001, the New Zealand Memorial, a gift to Australia from the 
people of New Zealand, was designed by Kingsley Baird and Studio of Pacific 
Architecture, together with paving designs by Toi Te Rito Maihi and Allen Wihongi (east 
side), and Daisy Nadjungdanga in association with Urban Art Projects (west side).  Baird 
(born 1957) is a Wellington (NZ)-based designer, whose work is mostly concerned with 
the themes of memory and remembrance.  His work in New Zealand includes The Tomb 
of the Unknown Warrior at the National War Memorial, New Zealand (Kingsley Baird,

Dedicated on 14 September 2017, the Australian Peacekeeping Memorial was designed by 
Super Colossal, an architectural practice based in Sydney.
Rats of 
Tobruk 
Memorial
Dedicated on 13 April 1981, the Rats of Tobruk Memorial was designed by the architects 
Denton Corker Marshall.  Marc Clark was the consultant sculptor on the project, and he 
also designed and created the ‘eternal flame’ component of the memorial.  Clark (born 
1923) studied sculpture in England before serving in the North Africa campaign during 
WWII.  He migrated to Australia in 1960.  His work is held by many state and regional 
galleries as well as the NGA and Parliament House (Australian Virtual Galleries, ‘Marc

Royal 
Australian 
Air Force 
Memorial
Dedicated on 15 March 1973, the original Royal Australian Air Force Memorial was 
designed by Inge King AM.  The later three black granite walls behind the sculpture were 
designed by Robert Boynes.  Inge King was born in 1918 in Berlin, where she also 
studied sculpture.  In 1939 she fled from Nazi Germany to England, and in 1951 she 
migrated to Australia, where she established herself as large-scale non-figurative sculptor.  
She has won numerous awards for her work, including the City of Melbourne Honoured 
Artist Award 1997.  In 2009, the Australian Arts Council awarded her the Visual Arts 
Emeritus Award, which recognised her pivotal role in raising the profile of modern 
sculpture in Australia (Wikipedia, ‘Inge King’, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inge_King, 
accessed October 2011).
Australian 
Service 
Nurses 
National 
Memorial
Dedicated on 2 October 1999, the Australian Nurses National Memorial was designed by 
Robin Moorhouse, a Sydney-based artist, who trained as a jeweller and silversmith before 
becoming a sculptor, in conjunction with MonuMental Design and Australian nursing 
associations.  The design was the result of a competition (Inglis, 1998, p. 485;  PNGAA 
Library, ‘The dedication of the Australian Services Nurses National Memorial, 
www.pngaa.net/Library/NurseMemorial.html, accessed October 2011).
Royal 
Australian 
Navy 
Memorial
Unveiled on 3 March 1986, the Royal Australian Navy Memorial was designed by 
sculptor Ante Dabro in collaboration with the architects Lester Firth and Associates and 
Robert Woodward.  Dabro (born 1938) is a Croation-born sculptor who has been based in 
Canberra since the late 1960s.  He lectured in the ANU School of Art from 1971 to 2004, 
and is regarded as one of Australia’s leading figurative sculptors (Wikipedia, ‘Ante 
Dabro’, en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ante_Dabro, accessed October 2011;  ACT Museums &

Kemal 
Ataturk 
Memorial
Dedicated on 25 April 1985, the Kemal Ataturk Memorial was designed by architectural 
firm PDCM Pty Ltd and Hüseyin Gezer.  Gezer (born 1920) is a Turkish sculptor who 
specialises in figural works.  He is regarded as having made an important contribution to 
statue art in Turkey, where he also worked as Director of the Academy of Fine Arts in 
Istanbul between 1969 and 1976.  His output includes several monuments to Ataturk 
(Artfact, ‘Huseyin Gezer (1920), www.artfact.com/artist/gezer-huseyin-68sff3dyce, 
accessed October 2011, site active 4 August 2022).
Analysis of the memorials
Most of the memorials have been created – or jointly created – by widely recognised major 
artists – Mary Hall, Joan Walsh Smith and Charles Smith, Les Kossatz and Augustine 
Dall’Ava, Ken Unsworth AM, Ray Ewers OAM, Kingsley Baird, Marc Clark, Inge King 
AM, Ante Dabro and Hüseyin Gezer.  Robin Moorhouse, the designer of the Australian 
Nurses National Memorial, is a Sydney-based jeweller and silversmith, and now a sculptor.  
She has been widely praised for this memorial.
It is true that each of the memorials was in a sense designed to a brief by a committee, and 
that some of the consultative processes involved compromise.  In the case of the Vietnam 
Forces National Memorial, the arguments and ensuing compromises have been 
documented (for an example see Inglis 1998, pp. 407-408).  Some may argue that a work 
born of compromise is not a true work of art, since it does not result from a single clear 
vision.  Be that as it may, the memorials indisputably have meaning, both for those closely 
connected to them and to the wider public.
They have also been widely photographed by the general public, and the numerous images 
published on web-based photo sites suggests that they are as interested in the details of the 
memorials as they are in the collection as a whole.
Some of the memorials have been well-depicted in publications.  In 1976 Cedric Emanuel

included drawings of two of the memorials – the Desert Mounted Corps Memorial and the 
Royal Australian Air Force Memorial – in his Canberra Sketchbook.  In 1995 Jean 
Weiner’s cartoon, ‘Inauguration Day: Australian Vietnam Forces National Monument’ 
appeared in Guy Freeland’s Canberra Cosmos, and in 1998 it was given further exposure 
in Ken Inglis’ Sacred Places: War Memorials in the Australian Landscape.
The memorials have also been documented twice by professional photographers for 
Commonwealth Government departments and agencies.  In 2002, Damian McDonald 
photographed all the memorials for the National Library of Australia.  His work is 
accessible on the Library’s website and is offered for sale as a set of photographs to the 
general public.  In 2007, Steve Wray and Dragi Markovic shared the job of photographing 
the memorials for the then Department of the Environment and Water Resources (now the 
Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment).  Their work is also accessible on 
the web and available for sale to the general public.
While the individual memorials have special significance to different groups of people – 
based upon personal or family connections with the events memorialised or in some cases 
upon ethnicity (this is explored further below) – the memorials are experienced as a group 
or collection by a large number of people, many being visitors to Canberra.  The 
memorials may therefore be viewed as a de facto sculpture park, albeit one based upon a 
common theme.  And it is perhaps in this way that for many people the memorials 
contribute to the aesthetic significance of Anzac Parade.
Anzac Parade as a whole
Visual Art
The axis of what is now Anzac Parade has featured in paintings from long before the road 
itself was officially opened in 1965.  The first work to include the line of the road is Louis 
McCubbin’s work, The Inauguration of the Australian War Memorial, Canberra, ANZAC 
Day 1929 (Australian War Memorial, ART09852, cas.awm.gov.au/item/ART09852, 
accessed October 2011).

(1899-1996) was born in England and migrated to Australia with his parents.  Between the 
wars, he worked as an artist, illustrator and cartoonist.  He spent much of his service in 
World War 2 recording the activities of Australian and American troops.  In January 1945 
he was appointed an official war artist.  The work, Canberra War Memorial from Mt 
Ainslie (29.5 x 37.8 cm, carbon pencil on paper), is held at the Australian War Memorial 
(ART29725, cas.awm.gov.au/item/ART29725, accessed October 2011).  This work is 
executed from a vantage point behind the Australian War Memorial, and its view includes 
the line of Anzac Parade (Warwick Heywood, Curator of Art, Australian War Memorial, 
personal communication, 18 October 2011).
Curtis depicted the Australian War Memorial in a drawing of 1945, War Memorial, 
Canberra, also held at the Australian War Memorial (ART29723, 
cas.awm.gov.au/item/ART29723, accessed October 2011).  However, this work does not 
depict any part of what became Anzac Parade (Warwick Heywood, Curator of Art, 
Australian War Memorial, personal communication, 18 October 2011).  In the same year, 
Curtis painted the Australian War Memorial.  It had by now been opened for four years, 
but Anzac Parade was only a grass track at the time.

In the early 1960s, the National Capital Development Commission commissioned 
Lawrence Daws to produce representations of Lake Burley Griffin that would assist in the 
design of its surrounding landscape.  Daws (born 1927), a trained engineer and architect, 
first came to prominence as a painter at a group exhibition in Melbourne in 1955.  From 
then on he has had numerous solo exhibitions both in the major Australian cities and 
overseas (McCulloch 1984, p 208).  For the NCDC he produced The Landscape of the 
Central Basin, Canberra, ACT, currently in the collection of the Canberra Museum and 
Gallery.  The painting is a map-like work, not specifically focussed on Anzac Parade

In 1964, the NCDC commissioned Kenneth Jack to produced sketches of the national 
capital for its publication The Future Canberra.  However, none of Jack’s sketches in this 
book is an image of Anzac Parade (Fiona Blackburn, Community Liaison Librarian, ACT 
Heritage Library, personal communication, 17 October 2011).
In 1965, the year that Anzac Parade was officially opened, the painter, teacher, illustrator, 
cartoonist and muralist, Harold Freedman (1915-1999) produced the series Canberra 
Lithographs.  These include ‘Canberra from Capital Hill Looking North-East’, which is 
essentially a panoramic view of Lake Burley Griffin with Anzac Parade at the centre of the 
work.  A pencil version is held in the National Gallery of Australia’s collection 
(artsearch.nga.gov.au/Detail.cfm?IRN=44335, accessed May 2012).

In 1976, Roberts (1976, passim) published Cedric Emanuel’s Canberra Sketchbook.  It 
contains sketches of two of the memorials that line Anzac Parade – the Desert Mounted 
Corps Memorial and the Royal Australian Air Force Memorial.  Emanuel (1906-1995) 
worked as a freelance artist for most of his working life.  He published numerous 
sketchbooks, and his work is held by major galleries including the National Gallery of 
Australia (Roberts 1976, passim).
In 1993 David Watt made a series of three works titled Amendments 1993 (gouache 
drawings on colour photographs), in which photos of iconic Canberra landmarks are 
depicted with mundane but recognisably Australian objects superimposed.  Two of the 
pictures in the series depict Anzac Parade, with the pond surrounded by a phalanx of Victa 
lawnmowers in one, and with carports surrounding the red gravel centre strip in the other.  
The works form part of the National Gallery of Australia’s collection, and were displayed 
in an exhibition at the Canberra Museum and Gallery in 2010 (Deborah Clark, Curator of 
Visual Arts, Canberra Museum and Gallery, personal communication, 13 October 2011).
Watt (1952-1998) was a painter, sculptor and teacher, who also taught at Curtin University 
and then the ANU.  During his time in Canberra (1991-1998) he was a prominent member 
of the local arts community (ACT Museums & Galleries, ‘David Watt’,

Photography
Very few professional photographers of national standing have published photographs of 
Anzac Parade.  The most prominent of those who have is Steve Parish, a Melbourne-based 
photographer who has won several major national awards and published at least twenty 
books in his fifty-year career as a photographer (Wikipedia, ‘Steve Parish’, 
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Parish, accessed October 2011;  Angus & Robertson, ‘All 
books by Steve Parish’, www.angusrobertson.com.au/by/steve-parish, accessed October 
2011, site inactive 4 August 2022).  However, he has published only one photograph of 
Anzac Parade, Sunset over the Parliamentary Triangle, Canberra.  This is a view in a 
southerly direction from Mount Ainslie along Anzac Parade to Parliament House.  It forms 
part of a series of colour postcards of Canberra that Parish published in 1990 (ACT

The professional art photographer whom one would have most expected to have published 
images of Anzac Parade is Heide Smith.  Born in Germany, Smith took up residence in 
Canberra in 1978 and set up a studio there in 1982.  She has a strong national reputation as 
a photographer, and her many awards include Australian Professional Portrait 
Photographer of the Year.  Between 1982 and 1999 she published four books of 
photographs of Canberra.  Between them they contain five images of the Australian War 
Memorial, but only one distant shot of Anzac Parade.
The professional photographer who has taken probably the greatest number of photographs 
of Anzac Parade is Damian McDonald (born 1971), a staff photographer at the National 
Library of Australia.  The Library holds a collection of 56 of his black and white 
photographs and 27 of his colour transparencies of Anzac Parade, all taken in 2002.  
Twenty-eight of these shots are published on the Library’s website.  They include night 
and daytime shots, as well as photographs of the individual war memorials and of the 
award-winning street lighting (Trove, 
trove.nla.gov.au/picture/result?q=anzac+parade+canberra+mcdonald&s=20, accessed 
October 2011, site inactive 4 August 2022).
The National Library of Australia website also includes four black and white images of 
individual memorials by Jon Rhodes (born 1947), an art photographer best known for his 
anthropological work (Art Gallery NSW, ‘Works by Jon Rhodes (1947- )’, 
www.artgallery.nsw.gov.au/collection/search/?artist_id=rhodes-jon, accessed October

The Library website (www.nla.gov.au/, accessed October 2011) and Picture Australia 
(www.pictureaustralia.org/, accessed October 2011, site inactive 4 August 2022) both hold 
16 photographs by Richard Clough documenting the construction of Anzac Parade.  
Professor Clough (born 1921) was until his retirement in 1986 one of Australia’s leading 
landscape architects.  He worked for the National Capital Development Commission from 
1956 and was in charge of the landscape design of Lake Burley Griffin.  His photographic 
collection contains images of Walter Burley Griffin’s plans for Canberra and other early 
documents dating from 1909, but it also holds numerous unattributed colour slides, many if 
not all of which were taken by Clough.  There are many aerial shots.  Clough’s images 
provide a workmanlike documentation of Canberra’s development, but they are not – and 
were not intended to be – art photos.  Nor is Clough regarded as a nationally significant 
photographer.  The above picture taken in the early 1960s gives an indication of his work.
Another to document the creation of Anzac Parade was Richard Charles Strangman, a 
professional photographer from Tumut, who worked in Canberra from 1927 until his death

the line of Anzac Parade between 1938 and 1940.  The following, taken in 1940, shows 
that plantings of trees defined the route at that time.

The ACT Heritage Library’s on-line collection of commercial postcards contains six 
postcards as well as the Steve Parish postcard previously referred to.  It is probable that 
most contain photos taken by professional photographers, although all but one are un-
named.  The postcards date from 1940 to about 1999.  The images are not displayed on the 
web, but their descriptions suggest that all are of the Land Axis, both towards the 
Australian War Memorial and towards Parliament House.  There is one aerial shot (ACT 
Heritage Library, Manuscript Collection, 
www.library.act.gov.au/find/history/search/Manuscript_Collections/commercial_postcards
, accessed October 2011).
The Picture Australia website claims to hold 199 images of Anzac Parade.  However, 
many of these are wrongly catalogued, and others focus on people and events so closely 
that the background is obscured to the point that it could be almost anywhere.  Of the 
relevant images, only five (apart from those already cited) may be attributed to 
professional photographers, the photo-journalists Darren Stones (3 images), Graham Tidy 
(1) and Bill Pedersen (1).  All the other relevant images of Anzac Parade, including the 
memorials that line it, are either unattributed or are clearly by non-professionals.
The National Library of Australia’s Trove website claims to hold 682 images of Anzac 
Parade (Trove, ‘Anzac Parade, Canberra’, trove.nla.gov.au/picture/result?q=anzac+parade 
+canberra, accessed October 2011).  Some are misfiled and the vast majority depict people 
and events such as Anzac Day parades and official visits.  Of the images that intentionally 
focus on Anzac Parade and its memorials, only two (apart from those already cited) are 
attributed to professional photographers – the freelance photographer Steve Wray (1 
image) (Steven Wray, home.earthlink.net/~swray, accessed October 2011), and Dragi 
Markovic (1), who is also believed to be a freelance photographer.
While not evidence of community value, Steve Wray and Dragi Markovic also shared the 
job of documenting the specific memorials along Anzac Parade for the then Department of 
the Environment and Water Resources (now the Department of Agriculture, Water and the 
Environment) in August 2007, Wray contributing 26 images and Markovic 28.  These

The Australian War Memorial’s collection of on-line photographs includes 46 images of 
Anzac Parade (‘Anzac Parade, Canberra’,

only 14 clearly depict Anzac Parade.  And even with these, the main focus is on an Anzac 
Day Parade.  None is accredited to a specific photographer.  The clearest image is below.

Literature
A brief review of the catalogues of the ACT Heritage Library failed to reveal any 
representations or significant mentions of Anzac Parade, in either fiction or poetry.  It is 
possible that further research may reveal some references.
Research undertaken by Dr David Young in 2006 on artistic and creative sources on Lake 
Burley Griffin revealed a number of references in both works of fiction and poetry, 
however, it was concluded that none of the references contributed significantly to the 
evaluation of the aesthetic significance of the place.  It is considered unlikely that a 
thorough search of references to Anzac Parade in fiction and poetry would provide results 
that would contribute significantly to the assessment of the aesthetic values of that place.
Taking snapshots
The images that people take can help us understand what they value and why.  Today, 
many people share their images via photo websites.  Three snapshot sites were also 
searched for images of Anzac Parade – Photobucket, Webshots and FlickR.  Photographers 
who exhibit on these sites generally refer to themselves by nickname.  Most are assumed to 
be amateurs.  The search in late October 2011 of Photobucket yielded 50 images when 
searched with the key phrase ‘Anzac Parade Canberra’.  Webshots yielded 263 images and 
FlickR 871 images.  It is noted that since that time, other websites, such as Instagram, also 
include many images related to Anzac Parade.
Of the 50 Photobucket images, 27 were of Anzac Parade viewed down the Land Axis and 
23 showed either aspects or the totality of specific memorials.  Five photos included 
people.
The results for the 263 Webshots images were skewed because about 150 of them were by 
a single photographer, ‘fiveamrunner’, who concentrated upon documenting an Anzac Day

dawn service.  Of the remaining images, 55 showed views along the Land Axis, and 39 
focussed upon either aspects or the totality of specific memorials.
Of FlickR’s 871 photos captured by searching for ‘Anzac Parade Canberra’, 251 did not 
appear to represent either Anzac Parade or the memorials along it.  Of the remaining 
images, 186 were of specific memorials or aspects of them, with about 350 focussing on 
the Land Axis.  About 314 of the latter were symmetrical.  It is also interesting to note that 
three of the symmetrical photos were included within composite commercial postcards of 
Canberra.
The following images are a selection of shots taken from the web that document the 
development of Anzac Parade over time.

The last photo in this sequence is typical of several ‘tourist photos’ of Anzac Parade, all of 
which feature smiling young people (presumably tourists) with Anzac Parade stretching 
behind them towards either the Parliament Houses, or the reverse view to the Australian 
War Memorial.
Analysis
Of the paintings, drawings and prints that have featured Anzac Parade both before and 
after its official opening in 1965, only two clearly reflect the aesthetic values of the place – 
Harold Freedman’s lithograph ‘Canberra Looking South-East’ (1965) and John Haycroft’s 
digitally enhance watercolour, ‘Rond Terraces Amphitheatre’ (2004) (see above).
Freedman’s work was published in his 1965 book, Canberra Lithographs, and it can be 
assumed that at the time it was viewed by several thousand people.  However, it is unlikely 
that it is well known today.  Haycroft’s work appeared in The Griffin Legacy, which is still 
available and well known in Canberra.
Both works centre on Anzac Parade looking in the direction of Mount Ainslie.  Their 
aesthetic strengths derive from the symmetry of the compositions, both of which reflect the 
natural geography of the area as well as the planned modified environment.
It is the same symmetrical strength of composition that has inspired large numbers of 
photographers (mostly amateurs) to focus on the symmetry of the Land Axis – both before 
and after 1965.  The aesthetic value of Anzac Parade, therefore, may be seen not solely as 
an attribute of the space itself, but rather as based on the relationship of the elements, the 
parade and the flanking parks, within its broad visual context.
An analysis of the 314 symmetrically composed images centred on the Land Axis and 
published in FlickR (October 2011) gives an indication of the values appreciated by those 
who took them.  Of the total, 262 (83%) were taken from the Australian War Memorial 
end of Anzac Parade.  These images tend to place the new Parliament House prominently 
as the distant focus.  Of the shots towards new Parliament House, 91 (29%) were taken 
from the Mount Ainslie lookout.  Such shots tend to emphasise depth of field, with the 
most effective images incorporating the Australian War Memorial in the foreground, and 
with a background of hills surmounted by less than 25% of sky.  In these shots, portrait 
layout seems to capture best the strong visual relationship between the Australian War

If any of these five related cultural elements were to be removed, the strength of the image 
would diminish considerably, as it would if Anzac Parade were to be narrower, less 
distinctively coloured or flanked by obtrusive buildings or roads.  The trees provide a 
strong framing element.
The photographer who took the image above subtitled it, ‘The most photographed scene in 
Canberra’.  While this assertion is not easily tested, this image is certainly typical of 
numerous similar shots displayed on the FlickR website.  As will be seen below from other 
sources, this is a ‘classic’ Canberra image.
About 60% of the FlickR photos of Anzac Parade taken in the direction of new Parliament 
House are shot from in front of the Australian War Memorial rather than from the Mount 
Ainslie lookout.

The aesthetic qualities of both preceding shots are based upon the strong perspective 
created by Anzac Parade, which leads the eye to Old Parliament House.  The compositions 
differ, as do all 176 shots from the Australian War Memorial at road level, mainly in the 
placement of the camera.  ‘Dr Hotdog’ has chosen the Stone of Remembrance as the 
foreground, while CS Hiland has chosen to stand further back and frame the image with 
the flagpoles in front of the Australian War Memorial.  The Stone of Remembrance, flags, 
bollards and the railings either side of the steps have all been chosen by numbers of 
photographers as the foregrounds of their compositions.
With shots of Anzac Parade in the direction of the Australian War Memorial, 
photographers tend to be as concerned with the choice of background as much as 
foreground, that choice being between the Australian War Memorial or Mount Ainslie, as 
seen below.  In both cases, it is Anzac Parade itself which provides the foreground rather 
than any discrete object, and its strength as such has much to do with the striking colour of 
the centre median and often the shadows that play on it.

It should also be noted that 38 (12%) of the FlickR shots are night shots, which capitalise 
upon the lines of street lighting running either side of Anzac Parade.  At night these 
reinforce the strong perspective of the composition more powerfully than they do by day.

Although the number of leading professional art photographers who have published or 
exhibited photos of Anzac Parade would appear low, the plethora of web-published 
amateur photos of Anzac Parade that are centred on the Land Axis attests to its community 
aesthetic appeal.
Of the professional photographers, it may be noted that Heide Smith chose a symmetrical 
view centred on the Land Axis for her sole published photograph of Anzac Parade (see 
above).  Furthermore, it is noteworthy that similar photos centred on the Land Axis appear 
on Steve Parish’s 1990 postcard, on five other sole-image commercial postcards of 
Canberra by anonymous professional photographers, as well as being included in the 
groups of images that comprise at least three composite commercial postcards of Canberra.  
In combination, this evidence indicates that this view is ‘iconic’ in the sense that it is 
‘readily recognized and generally represents an object or concept with great cultural 
significance to a wide cultural group’ (Wikipedia, ‘Cultural Icon, 
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cultural_icon, accessed October 2011).
It is also the case that Anzac Parade’s iconic status derives in part from its close 
association with the Australian War Memorial, claimed by the Department of Foreign 
Affairs and Trade to be an icon ranking ‘among the world’s great national 
monuments’(DFAT, ‘National Icons’, www.dfat.gov.au/facts/national_icons.html, 
accessed October 2011, site inactive 4 August 2022).
Even David Watt’s two images of Anzac Parade included in his Amendments 1993 series 
of paintings, suggest that the place was chosen for a gentle debunking precisely because of 
its iconic quality.

So too, it may be argued, does the fact that many tourists, especially young ones, favour 
shots of themselves standing in the foreground looking at the camera with Anzac Parade 
stretching behind them.  Nineteen of the 314 photos of Anzac Parade on the FlickR 
website are of this type (6%).  Such photos are commonly taken by tourists in front of 
many of Australia’s major icons – Cradle Mountain, the Sydney Opera House and Uluru, 
to name three.
While it may be seen as stretching a point to include Anzac Parade alongside such 
prestigious company, it may nevertheless be argued that Anzac Parade is of a type with the 
three named major Australian icons.  It differs from Cradle Mountain, Sydney Opera 
House and Uluru only in its being slightly less well known, and probably immediately 
recognisable by slightly fewer people.
But Anzac Parade, of course, is more than merely a view.  It was designed as a place in 
which events would occur, and sometimes the numbers at such events have been large.  
For example, 13,500 attended ANZAC Parade Open Day/Night joint event in 2000 
(Natalie Broughton, National Capital Authority, personal communication, 26 October 
2011).
In all events held at Anzac Parade, the main intentions are generally to commemorate, to 
show respect and to instil pride, the main moods experienced being those of reflection and 
contemplation.  These moods, in tandem with the emotions experienced by visitors, form 
part of the general response to the place.  As such, they must be taken into account when 
assessing its aesthetic value.
While there are many photos on the web that clearly indicate that strong emotions are 
being experienced by both participants and observers at ceremonies on Anzac Parade, such 
photos tend to concentrate upon the people and virtually exclude Anzac Parade itself as a 
recognisable place.  The photo above is a case in point.  It shows ex-servicewomen 
marching up Anzac Parade to the saluting base in 1972.  While their pride is evident, they 
could be on almost any street.

On the other hand, in those images of parades which privilege the place rather than the 
people, the dwarfed figures do little either to convey the emotions felt or to induce emotion 
in the viewer.

4.5 REVIEW OF TOURISM IMAGERY
Tourism images are used in aesthetic values assessments as evidence of expert opinion on 
places that are most likely to have a strong aesthetic appeal to the wider community and 
are therefore likely to attract people to visit that locality.  Common sources of tourism 
images are websites, tourism brochures and postcards.  Both websites and brochures may 
be used to help plan a visit, and as a guide when in the locality.  Postcards are most often 
purchased while visiting to capture an aspect of one’s experience of a place, and to keep it 
as a souvenir or share it with others ‘back home’.
Within the scope of this plan, the tourism materials looked at were limited to websites.
Visit Canberra is the main Canberra tourism website, and most other sites link to it.  The 
Australian War Memorial is promoted as,
‘‘Here is their spirit, in the heart of the land they loved; and here we guard the record which 
they themselves made’ (Charles Bean, founder).
The Australian War Memorial commemorates the sacrifice of Australian men and women who 
served in war.  Visit one of the world's great museums; an outstanding archive and centre for 
research into Australia's wartime history.
Pay your respects and reflect.  Find out what it was like to be in war.  Connect with people and 
events that helped shape Australia.
Share this unique experience with your family and friends today.  Discover what it means to be 
Australian.’  (Visit Canberra, www.visitcanberra.com.au/, accessed 13 Sep 2011)
Memorials, listed under Landmarks & Architecture, put Anzac Parade first (with at least 
one inaccuracy),
‘Discover Anzac Parade on foot — with its red gravel symbolising the bloodied sands of 
Gallipoli, and planting extending up to the Australian War Memorial, the walk takes in 11

4.6 EVENTS AND ACTIVITIES
Visitors, events and guided tours
As an open space, it is difficult to estimate the number of people who visit Anzac Parade 
and walk to each of the memorials.
Anzac Parade is the location of many events associated with commemoration.  The NCA 
advises that on average, eleven events have been held annually on Anzac Parade (based on 
data for 2009–2011).  A list of some of the annual events held at each memorial is included 
in a table below.
The number who attend Anzac Day is not usually recorded, but numbers are growing.  In 
2000, the NCA advises that 13,500 attended the ANZAC Parade Open Day/Night joint 
event with the Australian War Memorial.  In 2019, about 45,000 attended the dawn service 
and day time ceremonies.
Until around 2011, the NCA offered guided tours of Anzac Parade, and these were led by 
Ron Metcalfe OAM, a World War 2 veteran.  These tours were very popular and promoted 
through the Australian War Memorial, as well as via the NCA website.  The tours (Anzac 
on Parade) were offered by the NCA over a number years, with the highest numbers 
attending being 800+ in 2005-07, and a more typical year being around 180-200 (Natalie 
Broughton, email, 26/10/2011).
When Ron Metcalfe was no longer able to act as a guide, the conducted tours stopped.  The 
NCA subsequently prepared the Anzac Parade Walking Tour Podcast (2009) which was 
available from its website.  It featured interviews with a number of ex-service personnel, 
including Ron Metcalf, and provided information on each memorial.  While this is no 
longer available, self-guided tours are available (https://www.nca.gov.au/attractions/take-
tour).
The NCA describes the significance of Anzac Parade as,
‘visually powerful, with a red gravel central strip and dark eucalypt ‘walls’.  The red gravel of 
the central strip was originally made from crushed Canberra house bricks.  The material was 
chosen in part for the similarity to the ‘crunch’ made by military boots during a parade.  The 
‘walls’ are created by the Victorian Blue Gum, Eucalyptus bicostata, and the planter boxes, 
which contrast in colour to the crushed red brick paving, [had at the time] the native New 
Zealand plant Hebe ‘Autumn Glory’ growing in them (symbolising the Anzac connection).’  
(https://www.nca.gov.au/sites/default/files/2021-
12/Anzac%20Parade_WalkingTour_Flyer%20online.pdf, accessed 4 August 2022)
The NCA podcast is regularly accessed from their website, with 432 hits in 2008-09, the 
year it was launched, but fewer in 2010-11.
The podcast highlights the importance of some of the memorials from the perspective of 
those with associations to this place.  Ron Metcalfe, with his long associations as a guide 
to Anzac Parade and as an ex-serviceman, thinking about the view and the links along the 
Land Axis, says,
‘The War Memorial and Anzac Parade and Parliament all are linked, in my opinion, as just 
Australia, what we felt was the right thing to do about the world and to honour people that died 
and to bring that history to the young… It’s always a remembrance issue and it seems to me 
the whole linked with Parliament itself, it couldn’t be more appropriate really, it’s what 
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
Australia thinks is a good idea.’
Much of the podcast focuses on interpreting the symbolism of each memorial and of Anzac 
Parade itself.  As such the podcast is a valuable interpretive device.  For example,
‘The red gravel forecourt is a good place to take in the overall effect of the Memorial – the 
gravel itself suggestive of a parade ground.  Indeed, the same red gravel along the centre of 
Anzac Parade accommodates military parades and ceremonials on special occasions – such as 
Anzac Day... with the colour representing bloodshed in war.’
As noted elsewhere, the symbolism attached to the red gravel appears to have been a 
development after the design, rather than as part of the original design.
Looking at the Australian Army National Memorial, with its sculpture ‘Every Mother’s 
Son’ depicting two infantrymen, World War 2 veteran, William Higgy OAM, explains the 
symbolism and significance the memorial has for him.
‘It has a rock-like formation which… is a reflection of the army’s relationship to the land.  
There is a reflecting pond, this is again symbolic of the journey over water that our troops, that 
our service people have taken and it’s facing east.  So you have there the symbolism of the 
rising sun and the dawn of the new day and it has at its base the radiating army insignia.’
In this memorial, as in others, ‘it is Australians rather than the Australian Army whose 
involvement is remembered’ (NCA 2009, ‘Anzac Parade Walking Tour Podcast’, 
www.nationalcapital.gov.au/, accessed 2011, not accessible 4 August 2022).  The inclusion 
of ‘people’ is common across the set of memorials, but in some instances reflects 
subsequent additions, such as at the Royal Australian Air Force Memorial (originally from 
1973) where a black granite backdrop was added in 2002 (NCA, 
https://www.nca.gov.au/attractions/take-tour/anzac, accessed 4 August 2022).
Community activities and events
Most of the events held in Anzac Parade are commemorative events at a particular 
memorial, and each attracts a particular audience of people with connections to that 
memorial.  A number of examples are described below, in the words of those who 
participated (see also Section 4.7).
A list of memorials, their dates of dedication and the regular events held is provided below.  
This listing may not be complete.  It is based on the citation for Anzac Parade developed

4.7 COMMUNITY PERCEPTIONS, MEANINGS AND ASSOCIATIONS
This section of the report describes the values attributed to Anzac Parade for each 
associated community that emerged from the investigations into social and community-
held aesthetic significance described above.
From the work undertaken for this plan, and considering earlier assessments and other 
research, the following themes have emerged for Anzac Parade:
•
Anzac Parade as a symbolic space;
•
Anzac Parade as a place for ceremonies, commemorations and gatherings;
•
Anzac Parade as a place where important events and contributions are remembered 
and memorialised;
•
Anzac Parade is a key element in the iconic Land Axis;
•
Anzac Parade as a focus for grief and grieving;  and
•
Anzac Parade as a symbol of a sovereign state.
These themes are discussed below.
Anzac Parade as a symbolic space
Anzac Parade is imbued with an array of symbolic meanings, linked to concepts of 
democracy, service and remembrance.  As part of the expression of Australia as a nation, 
Anzac Parade is at the heart of and linked to significant national symbols.  Previous 
assessments have highlighted a number of aspects of the symbolism of the larger landscape 
and Anzac Parade.
For focus group participants, they regarded Anzac Parade as having national significance 
for Australians as part of our collective memory and way of understanding ourselves.  
They saw it as the place where,
‘(there is) national recognition of their sacrifice... for our country and nation... as something 
important to hang on to
...as a focus for commemoration
...as a place where people can pay their respects to [others] who have sacrificed themselves for 
freedom and democracy... like going to a worship place.
...it’s not a place for the glorification of war, it is not a religious place, it is a secular place... 
and yet it encompasses all those feelings.’
The idea that Anzac Parade helps Australians understand themselves, in the past, and helps 
people look to the future, was evocatively expressed,
‘it helps explain ourselves to ourselves – the story of Anzac is a long way away in some senses 
but it connects very strongly to today – Anzac Parade and the Australian War Memorial is the 
focus of something which is esoteric and very hard to grasp... the whole precinct grounds 
[people] in their search for understanding of what it means to them... in every state there is a 
great resurgence of interest in these heritage matters and about the national character and I 
think this that is what this precinct serves – a grounding and a focal point’  (Ian, Focus Group 
2)
Asked about its symbolism for Canberra residents, focus group participants suggested that 
Canberra people feel pride in living in the national capital, as evidenced by their activism

if key parts of the design are seen to be threatened or at risk, and that if any of the 
memorials were damaged there would be great concern.
Canberra people has a sense of pride that it’s here – ‘this is ours, it’s      really lovely to 
have it in our backyard’ – and a sense of ownership.  And with a relatively high proportion 
of the Canberra community connected to Defence, this may add to the recognition of the 
importance of Anzac Parade.  Canberra people like to impress their visitors with the ‘wow’ 
factor in looking down the axis from each end,
‘The vision splendid does resonate very strongly with the Canberra community’  (Focus Group 
2)
But as well, there is the pleasure for those who have served when they see ‘others who 
have not served in the Defence Services show their respect and gratitude to those who did’ 
(Pat, Focus Group 1).
Some focus group participants saw Anzac Parade as largely ‘the preserve of people who 
have served the country in uniform’ compared to the large number of visitors to the 
Australian War Memorial for whom Anzac Parade is,
‘mainly a view to parliament.  The memorials belong to the people who have served and their 
families... and for many visitors there is ignorance about its significance’  (Pete, Focus Group 
2)
‘All who have served in Australian defence forces would be proud to march down there and 
would feel a sense of national pride – not in any vainglorious way but to say I served my 
country, I am proud to be an Australian, I am proud just to be here.’  (Peter, Focus Group 1)
Asked who would defend Anzac Parade if it was threatened, participants in the second 
focus group said that ‘Service people would be in the vanguard’.
Doyle suggests the memorials are part of a larger military history narrative and also one 
that links to our perceptions and memories of the particular times associated with each 
conflict,
‘the axis of Anzac Parade inscribes the military narrative connecting the War Memorial to the 
Parliamentary triangle as symbolic of some aspects of a national image... the various 
memorials and monuments, even shrines, can be read as paragraphs within that narrative of 
Australian military history.  The variety of memorial, monument and statue along the parade 
speaks another series of narratives... in the vocabulary of public monumental or 'sacred' special 
space art.  And those narratives are reflective of their own times of construction as much as 
their designers desire them to be reflective of the times which they commemorate.  So the 
Korean Memorial is clearly aimed at being reflective of the 1950s, but is equally or more 
clearly a late twentieth century memory of the 1950s.’  (Doyle 2000, p. 9)
Each memorial is equally filled with symbols that require a careful, informed reading.  For 
example, describing the symbols contained in the Vietnam memorial, one participant 
commented,
‘The memorials while they have an explanatory plaque... it hardly scratches the surface of what the 
memorial is about... for example the MIA seats... Where are the seats positioned?  They are outside 
the memorial because they are still away.’  (Focus Group 1)
Doyle also suggests a distinctively different symbol that might be read into the space,
‘the fact that the whole of the Anzac Parade is placed within, and seems to grow organically

out of, the local urban space means that apart from that large axis of the Australian War 
Memorial to Parliament there is an almost more important embedding of the memorials and 
their symbolic values within their typical communities—suburban Australia.  Australian 
service personnel may have fought to establish and maintain the democracy symbolised by the 
Parliament but the nearby housing is rather more pertinently the very literal thing itself they 
fought for—home and hearth.’  (Doyle 2000, p. 10)
Anzac Parade as a place for ceremonies, commemorations and gatherings
The individual memorials, set within their own space and enclosed by trees, are designed 
as engaging, symbolic and ritual spaces – places to enter and connect actively with the 
place through all ones senses – fragrance, touch, sight and sound.  Each offers a designed 
space for commemoration ceremonies.  The activities that these memorials and memorial 
spaces provide may well be as important as the physical fabric of the memorial itself.  The 
Australian Service Nurses National Memorial, for example,
‘is a memorial that invites you to walk into and through its space.  To see and consider the 
images and to read of the conflicts and the places where Australian nurses have served... The 
garden, down the ramp from the walls, has a waterfall that separates the area for contemplation 
from the memorial itself.  Recalling that nurses often established gardens where ever they were 
posted, the garden has been planted with rosemary, the traditional plant for remembrance, and 
is the only memorial to have a seat integrated into its main design’  (NCA 2009, ‘Anzac Parade 
Walking Tour Podcast’, www.nationalcapital.gov.au/, accessed 2011, not accessible 4 August 
2022)
At the Korean memorial the colours and metal field of poles evoke the cold and colourless 
winter landscape strongly remembered by those who served in Korea,
‘Those rods in front of the Korean memorial are so cold and yet that was Korea, bitterly cold 
for our troops up there.’  (Defence Force veteran Bernie Sullivan AM, NCA 2009, ‘Anzac 
Parade Walking Tour Podcast’, www.nationalcapital.gov.au/, accessed 2011, not accessible 4 
August 2022)
Doyle writes about Anzac Parade and the memorial spaces themselves as performative 
spaces, engaging and interacting with the visitor.  He suggests that the design of the 
Korean memorial intentional creates, ‘an environment into and around which the visitor 
can, indeed is invited to move’ (Doyle 2000, p. 6).
The feelings created by the memorial designs and spaces were commented on in the focus 
groups,
‘the Navy memorial is wonderful especially when the water is running...’
‘...Greek memorial where you trip over the rocks... but that is significant too…’
‘And how you have to move through the Turkish memorial...’
Anzac Parade as a place where important events and contributions are remembered 
and memorialised
Anzac Parade is a complex place.  It is a parade ground (outside the study area of this 
plan), a ceremonial space, part of the Land Axis vista.  Anzac Parade can be read as,
‘a summary of Australia’s military involvements... connecting the Australian War Memorial to 
the Parliamentary Buildings of the triangle across the lake... ‘curious’ because it consists of a 
series of discrete monuments nestled within their own niches along two sides of the Parade... 
Australian in the quiet reticence of their nestling – there is no strident militarism here’  (Doyle

2000).
The extent of memorialisation that exists in the Australian War Memorial and Anzac 
Parade has been a subject for some discussion in response to a proposal to place two new 
memorials on the Rond Terraces, beyond Anzac Parade and in the Land Axis.  These 
discussions enable an examination of the perceived purpose of the existing memorials 
today.
Some interesting reflections on the importance of Anzac Parade to the associated armed 
services community are documented in submissions to the Commonwealth Parliamentary 
Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories, through the 
Lake War Memorials Forum (a group opposed to the then proposed memorials), and in 
the Canberra Times.  For example, Air Marshal David Evans AC DSO AFC, a former 
Chief of the Air Staff and former Chair of the NCA, offered the following perspective,
‘What has been created here in the National Capital – the Australian War Memorial and 
ANZAC Parade is a tasteful and revered sanctuary visited by hundreds of thousands each year.  
They come to learn of the deeds and sacrifices and to pay homage to the men and women who 
served and indeed to the sacrifices of their families.’  (Lake War Memorials Forum, 
www.lakewarmemorialsforum.org/23March.html, accessed 2011, archived at 
https://webarchive.nla.gov.au/tep/157452)
Neil James, Executive Director of the Australia Defence Association, comments on the 
vista and its symbolism,
‘First, there is the continuing importance of the vista from the new and old parliament houses 
down Federation Mall across the lake up Anzac Parade to the Australian War Memorial.  This 
is not just a scenic or town planning issue.  This vista is important in symbolic, moral, 
historical and indeed practical terms.  It serves as a perpetual reminder to all at Parliament 
House, and all who visit it, that generations of Australians have had to defend in war the 
liberties and general way of life that parliament represents.  Most of them ordinary Australians, 
not defence force personnel by profession, serving in our defence force temporarily and only 
for the duration of such wars.’  (Lake War Memorials forum, ‘Neil James’, 
www.lakewarmemorialsforum.org/23March.html, accessed 2011, archived at 
https://webarchive.nla.gov.au/tep/157452)
Turning to Anzac Parade he notes the,
‘two giant handles of a Maori Keti, or basket, on each of the corners with Constitution Avenue.  
These frame, and begin, the national avenue of war memorials very well and form a triangle 
with the Australian War Memorial at the other end.  They imaginatively commemorate our 
deep and continuing military and strategic links with New Zealand and the sacrifices made, 
and probably again made in future, together.’  (Lake War Memorials forum, ‘Neil James, 
www.lakewarmemorialsforum.org/23March.html, accessed 2011, archived at 
https://webarchive.nla.gov.au/tep/157452)
For focus group participants, commemoration in Anzac Parade is very much about the 
individuals who served, rather than about particular conflicts or services.  While several 
memorials, such as the Vietnam and Korea memorials, focus on particular conflicts, in 
another way the recognition offered by these memorials was designed to counter the lack 
of recognition felt by service personnel following their return from overseas service.  Both 
examples contain a strong sense of those who served – in the Korean memorial through the 
life-size figures and in the Vietnam memorial through the wall of words and the images.
‘the memorials give a sense of recognition – and anybody who has made a sacrifice (either by 
serving overseas or suffering loss of some sort)... comes back not with a need for recognition 
as an overt thing... but getting recognition makes an enormous difference to the loss they or

their mates have made... especially if they have lost mates... they want their mates to get 
recognition... And second it gives meaning to those losses to have a memorial as a permanent 
marker... it eases the burden... that’s what these memorials do...’  (Ian, Focus Group 2)
Anzac Parade as a key element in the iconic Land Axis
The Land Axis and vista is already nationally recognised and its values are well described 
in previous assessments discussed above.  In relation to Anzac Parade itself, Ken Taylor, 
writing in the Canberra Times notes,
‘the national significance of Anzac Parade, overlain with the Anzac legend and Australian 
history and nationhood, have added another layer of meaning to Griffin’s axis...’  (Taylor 
2011, p. 19)
The Director of the Australian War Memorial wrote about the significance of the Land 
Axis, and in particular Anzac Parade, in a submission to the parliamentary inquiry into the 
National Memorials Ordnance.  Commenting on the realisation of memorials on the Land 
Axis, he notes that it,
‘represents a symbolically strong sight line that can be read on several levels... on one level it 
represents the primacy of parliament in a democratic nation... and... represents a powerful 
reminder when democratically elected representatives of the people are considering the 
implications of committing young men and women of the Australian Defence Force overseas 
in the national interest...’  (Gower 2011)
He also notes that there is a risk of distracting from or diminishing this symbolism should 
new structures be placed on the axis.
Anzac Parade and its memorials as a focus for personal grief and grieving and 
remembering
Anzac Parade and more particularly the memorials are places for people to remember, to 
come together and to grieve.
It may be surprising to describe a memorial as a meeting place, but for those with Service 
connections, Canberra is the preferred place for many reunions.  Discussed at the first 
focus group, participants agreed that a typical reunion would involve people getting 
together at a local venue to socialise and then they would visit their particular memorial, 
probably followed by dinner together and then to the Australian War Memorial the next 
day.
‘The memorials are really meeting places and a focal point’  (Focus Group 1)
Creating a place where particular people or groups can be remembered has become one of 
the purposes of Anzac Parade.  Inglis writes about the creation of Anzac Parade as a 
‘sacred way’, with the flanking memorials reminiscent of the sacred way joining ‘Athens 
to Eleusis, flanked by sculptures commemorating heroes, gods and civic events’ (Inglis 
2005, pp. 402-403).  As Inglis notes, ‘here were sites looking for monuments’ and he 
describes how the establishment of virtually every memorial was advocated by those with 
direct connections to the events, people and organisations to be memorialised.
The importance of memorials in Australia is seen to be connected to the nature of 
Australia’s experience of war as fought overseas, with the bodies of those who died buried 
overseas – it was not until 1964 that Australia started the practice of ‘bringing them home’

(a phrase now more closely associated with the Aboriginal ‘stolen generations’).  For 
generations of Australians, war memorials, were the graves.
‘Those war memorials are a collective cemetery for those we lost in the Great War’  (Focus 
Group 2)
Today there is still a perceived need for memorials, some to ‘complete the picture’ – such 
as the Boer War Memorial and Peacekeepers Memorial which were realised in 2017.  
Focus group participants saw that Anzac Parade and the Australian War Memorial should 
remain the focus for memorialisation of armed conflicts, but recognised that the valued 
attributes of the place should not be sacrificed for more memorials.
At a personal level, ‘memorials remain sites for mourning victims of war after war’, and 
ceremonies held at memorials combine both shared grieving and personal loss (Inglis 
2005, p. 472).  Inglis notes that memorials are significant ‘sites of memory’, with practices 
such as the laying of wreaths containing personal messages, and the placing of poppies an 
expression of this (Inglis 2005, p. 472).  These practices are common across Australia’s 
war memorials, and have recently become a practice associated with public expressions of 
grief for tragic or deeply felt community losses.  The outpouring of grief around the deaths 
of celebrities, and the roadside memorials to lives lost in car accidents are contemporary 
examples.
Showing the people who served
War memorials, according to Inglis, also often symbolise those who are missing, perhaps 
buried overseas in a marked or unmarked grave, or simply ‘missing in action’.  The figure 
of a soldier, the most common of all war memorials across Australia, can be seen as ‘an 
absence, a representative of those dead men whose bodies never returned to their own 
people’ (Inglis 2005, p. 474).  Interestingly, the memorials on Anzac Parade are almost all 
‘peopled’.  However, not all were originally conceived with the human form as part of the 
design.
For example, the Air Force Memorial, with its starkly beautiful airfoils designed by 
sculptor Inge King, was seen as ‘a tribute to the service, rather than to the men and women 
who have served’ and, following advocacy by the Air Force Association, a plaque to the 
service personnel was added in 1993.  In 2002 a granite backdrop with images of airforce 
operations and people from World War I to the present was added (NCA 2009, ‘Anzac 
Parade Walking Tour Podcast’, www.nationalcapital.gov.au/, accessed 2011, not 
accessible 4 August 2022).  Today the memorial reflects both the grace and power of flight 
combined with images of those who served.
Ian Crawford, Chair of the Australian National Korean War Memorial played a founding 
role in the establishment of this memorial.  Describing the complex process of achieving 
the design, he explained that he particularly admired the Desert Mounted Corps Memorial 
because it ‘told the story’ and was not ‘overly symbolic’ – in his view memorials are 
designed for the ordinary soldier, sailor or airman who wants to see what they experienced.  
The design of the Korean war memorial occurred through a design competition, and the 
selected design had great architectural and sculptural beauty in his eyes, but it ‘didn’t tell 
the story for ordinary servicemen like me’.  The idea of figures within the field of poles 
was mooted.  Asked why the need for figures, he responded ‘because the war was fought 
by soldiers, sailors and airmen’.

Dedication ceremonies
Each memorial has its own community of people who feel connected to that service, 
conflict or those they served with, and the dedication services for each seem to evoke 
strong feelings.
A personal account of the dedication of the Australian Service Nurses National Memorial 
in 1999 by Pat Johnson (‘Una Voce’, 4 December 1999) described the response of some of 
the service nurses present as they looked at the glass panels depicting ‘typical’ places 
where nurses have served, and the feelings of connection these images evoked,
‘Although not of any specifically recognisable place, some of the nurses visiting appeared to 
recognise several of the scenes depicted.  Likewise myself, the tropical scene depicting Pacific 
areas caused me to remark "I know where that place is", it was a small peaked mountain with a 
harbour below... For my part, I had to have a photo of that section.’
Later after the dedication, she recalls,
‘We returned to the Nurses Memorial again.  Now that we knew something of the conceptual 
ideas, we wanted to take it all in again slowly and read the inscriptions as well as viewing the 
Memorial in sunlight.  We sat in the contemplative area, casting our eyes down the panels and 
listening to the soft tinkling of the waterfall.  We walked along the front reading the cards on 
the wreaths.  Yes, this Memorial is certainly different and unique.  Later that evening we 
attended a function hosted by the Vietnam Veterans' Association where we were treated to yet 
another feast of food, drink and stories... We drove back to Sydney (it was still raining) in quiet 
contemplation of the events of the weekend and marvelled at the spirit of all the thousands of 
nurses who visited Canberra for this important dedication.’  (Pat Johnson, ‘Una Voce’, 4 
December 1999)
Writing about the dedication of the Korean Memorial, Doyle (2000, p. 8) notes the crowd 
of around 15,000-20,000 and a ceremony ‘focused on the troops and memories’ with a 
large Korean delegation handing out hand fans and a ‘wonderous’ performance of the 
Dance of Peace.  His analysis exposes the nature of the space created by the memorial as a 
‘spectacular space’ where the visitor is required to perform – to come into the space, to 
move through and engage with the elements, and ‘then to make up some kind of narrative 
from those elements’,
‘They do not just celebrate known events, they recreate them newly for most of their visitors—
their interactants;  they refashion the memory for those who need more than memory—for 
those who need simulated memory, or rather, their memory re-simulated.  By definition this is 
the experience for most of their visitors after the effects of the dedication have passed.  Once 
the Korean veterans themselves have gone for all subsequent visitors the memorial is a space 
of either older style museum-like experience, to look merely at objects—figures, badges, 
photographs—or mimed machinery, or to be invited to partially experience a simulacra of the 
otherwise elsewhere 'sacred site'.  These memorials are in this sense interactive, like much 
modern installation art’  (Doyle 2000, p. 9)
For Ian Crawford (personal communication, 11 October 2011), the dedication service was 
‘an opportunity for the Korean war and the veterans to be recognised’ and part of the 
ceremony was a march down Anzac Parade.  It was, in his words, ‘moving’ but did not 
provide closure for everyone as, ‘some veterans still feel they have not had a welcome 
home march and the one held in Brisbane years later didn’t have the national focus’, 
illustrating not only the importance of recognition but also of national events and 
memorials for those who served for the nation.
He was aware of the importance of the dedication for ‘grieving families’ becoming a 
‘focus for their grief’, and is even more important for the families of servicemen missing in

action or those buried in the United National War Cemetery in Pusan, Korea.  A change to 
the memorial has seen two Korean plants – a box and a fir tree – used to edge the memorial 
space, making a direct link to Korea, ‘for the grieving families some of whom may never 
be able to go to Korea to see the memorial for their loved one’.
The dedication of the Vietnam memorial, and the return of the remains of several men 
missing in action were intensely moving ceremonies, bringing a sense of pride and ‘of 
being at one with all those gathered’.  Speaking about the tenth anniversary of the 
dedication, Pete Ryan spoke of the 8,000 Vietnam veterans who showed up, with about 
2,000 who had come ‘out of the closet’ for the first time,
‘When you see those people at our memorial you get to understand what people who have lost 
loved ones... actually see and feel’  (Focus Group 2)
Valuing the memorials of others
Does the armed services community value and feel a connection to memorials associated 
with other parts of the service, or conflicts of which they were not a part?  Pat Johnson 
offers a delightful insight in her account of the official dedication ceremony of the 
Australian Service Nurses National Memorial,
‘Just as proceedings were to commence, there was a "vroom" and "roar" of motorcycle engines 
on the other side of Anzac Parade.  We all turned and saw a large contingent of the "Vietnam 
Bikies" from all over Australia parking their motorbikes on the grass before coming over to 
watch the proceedings.  There they were, in their leather jackets, emblazoned with a skull and 
slouch hat atop.  I could not help but be moved when chatting to a group of them afterwards, 
one of them said to me "we come every two years to rededicate the Vietnam War Memorial 
and we decided to coincide the visit with the dedication of the Nurses' Memorial".  Continuing, 
he said “we wanted to be a presence but it is the nurses' day”.  I asked this group of somewhat 
burly men what they thought of the Memorial and the reply astounded me.  "It is beautiful, 
calm and gentle, so different to the other masculine memorials."  With that, they all went off to 
their special memorial.’  (‘Una Voce’, 4 December 1999)
Similarly, the focus group discussions reinforced the value of all of the memorials, while 
recognising that particular memorials have specific significance to those who are closely 
connected with what it memorialises.
Anzac Parade as a symbol of a sovereign state
War memorials are a statement about the ‘authorising power of the state’ to dedicate the 
lives of its citizens to a conflict where it is likely many will be lost (Inglis 2005, p. 471).  
In Canberra, the notion of the state is profoundly apparent through the placement of the 
Australian War Memorial and Anzac Parade on the Land Axis with Parliament House at 
the other end.
For those service community participants, Anzac Parade is seen as conveying the power of 
the state over its citizens.  The placement of the Australian War Memorial at one end of the 
axis and Parliament House at the other.  This was expressed somewhat cynically by some, 
and more positively by others,
‘That the politicians can go out their front door and be reminded of what they have done...’  
(Focus Group 1)
‘Symbol of democracy... the symbol of the price of democracy…’  (Focus Group 2)
‘The symbolism is important – Parliament House at one end and the AWM at the other with a 
parade – it’s a great avenue – that commemorates what Australians have done in conflicts to

preserve our independence and peace – and what Australian governments have done… a good 
world citizen in stepping forward and dedicating Australians to help – also the Defence forces 
– the qualities of leadership, resourcefulness and confidence.’  (Ian Crawford, personal 
communication, 11 October 2011)
Sovereign states have the capacity to enter into relationships with other sovereign states, 
and this is expressed in Anzac Parade in the Hellenic, Ataturk, New Zealand and Korean 
memorials.  With the first three, the placement of the memorial embodies aspects of the 
relationship, whereas with the Korean memorial the South Korean Government supports 
commemorative events there and offers a variety of support to servicemen who served in 
the Korean War.
The New Zealand Memorial for example, is designed to,
‘honour the strong bonds between Australia and New Zealand, forged first during colonial 
times, most famously at Gallipoli, and renewed on many occasions since’  (New Zealand 
Memorial Dedication, 2000)
Symbolically, the ground of the memorial is part of New Zealand because it is ‘tapu’ 
(sacred) based on the ceremonies undertaken by Maori at the dedication of the memorial, 
creating for New Zealanders a ‘place to remember your country, not just remember a 
conflict’ (Hedgley, personal communication, 13 October 2011).
From an Australian perspective, Professor Gammage suggests that the New Zealand 
Memorial can be seen as ‘symbolically closing the parade of monuments which the War 
Memorial begins’.  He continues,
‘No nations share a bond as close as Anzac has bonded Australia, New Zealand, and Turkey.  
No memorial should be allowed to stumble onto the ground which commemorates that special 
bond’  (Gammage, ‘The lakeside memorials and the Walter Burley Griffin vision’, 
www.lakewarmemorialsforum.org/opinion-docs.html, accessed 2011, archived at 
https://webarchive.nla.gov.au/tep/157452)
For example, the Hellenic Memorial is a landmark for Greek people, and its position at the 
top of Anzac Parade is important.  The use of the term ‘Hellenic’ rather than Greek in the 
naming of the memorial refers to the Hellenic peoples – peoples of a like-mind and with 
shared values – and is deliberately distinct from the concept of the state (Christopolous & 
Kazan, personal communication, 13 October 2011).  The naming also allows it to include 
all of the battles fought in this theatre, not just those that took place on the Greek mainland 
(NCA 2009, ‘Anzac Parade Walking Tour Podcast’, www.nationalcapital.gov.au/, 
accessed 2011, not accessible 4 August 2022).
The memorial represents the close ties between Australia and Greece that have come from 
the two countries ‘standing together in battle for the same ideals – democracy and 
freedom’.  These connections go back to World War 1 when Greece gave the British forces 
full sovereignty over four islands for the period of the war as the base for their Gallipoli 
campaign – these island were the base, and where hospitals and supplies were located.  
Again Greece and Australia were allies in World War 2, again in Korea, and most recently 
in Afghanistan.  The Battle of Crete was a key turning point in World War 2.  As well, the 
Embassy of Greece in Canberra, established 45 years ago, in the largest overseas Greek 
embassy, a mark of the importance of the state-to-state relationship (Christopolous & 
Kazan, personal communication, 13 October 2011).

Moreover, the memorials represent a symbolic linking of the peoples not just the states or 
governments.  For the Greek community of Canberra for example, the Australian Hellenic 
Memorial is understood to be a symbol of great pride.  They raised the funds for it, and 
hold wreath laying ceremonies there with significant visitors, as well as participating in 
Anzac Day, and holding special ceremonies to mark Greek National Day (March 25) and 
the Battle of Crete (last Sunday in May).
‘The Australian Hellenic Memorial represents the standing, since time immemorial, ideals of 
the Hellenic civilization.  Freedom, human personality, active involvement in society, 
democracy.  Hellenes and Australians have always stood unwaveringly together for the same 
ideals and have shed their blood side by side to defend and promote them.’  (HE Ambassador 
Alexios Christopoulos, personal communication)
The Ataturk Memorial was funded by the Australian Government as part of state-to-state 
negotiations about the naming of Anzac Cove.  The Ataturk Memorial is essentially the 
memorial to the ANZAC forces and Gallipoli, representing both sides.  In the NCA 
podcast, World War 2 veteran William Higgy OAM comments on its broader significance,
‘There is no actual memorial on Anzac Parade called the Anzac Memorial, and perhaps this is 
the closest’  (NCA 2009, ‘Anzac Parade Walking Tour Podcast’, www.nationalcapital.gov.au/, 
accessed 2011, not accessible 4 August 2022)
The comforting words of Atatürk, reputedly written in 1934 as a tribute to the ANZACs 
killed at Gallipoli, are a powerful feature of this memorial,
‘Those heroes that shed their blood and lost their lives... You are now lying in the soil of a 
friendly country.  Therefore rest in peace.  There is no difference between the Johnnies and the 
Mehmets to us where they lie side by side now here in this country of ours... you, the mothers, 
who sent their sons from faraway countries wipe away your tears;  your sons are now lying in 
our bosom and are in peace.  After having lost their lives on this land.  They have become our 
sons as well.’  (Inscription on Kemal Atatürk Memorial at ANZAC Parade, Canberra, 
Australian War Memorial www.awm.gov.au/encyclopedia/ataturk.asp, accessed Nov 2011, site 
inactive 4 August 2022)
It is noted that some research casts doubt on the authorship of these exact words attributed 
to Ataturk.
What is it about this place?
As a physical place, Anzac Parade is replete with symbols embedded in the design – the 
colour of the gravel, the use of Australian and New Zealand plants, the niches into which 
the memorials are set and more.  For those with service connections, what is it about this 
place that embodies its significant meanings?
Asked about the elements that are important, the first focus group highlighted the trees – 
the Australianness of the eucalypts as an element that connects all Australians.  This was 
reiterated in the second focus group, especially the contrast between the openness of the 
space (which was valued highly) and the enclosing trees,
‘it’s the Australian bush what the country is made of... so you have the wide open plains of 
Australia and the bush... you can’t separate those two things’  (Focus Group 2)
And with these trees comes the chorus of cockatoos, often joining in the Anzac Day Dawn 
Service, occasionally with a Kookaburra.  While the memorials are not thought to be

important to all Australians, the trees are.  Of course to those with service connections, the 
memorials are significant.
‘All the memorials are equally important – all part of our history and they are inscribed there 
and should stay... they each support the other’  (Focus Group 2)
‘All memorials are important and each adds to the story – we have named it at a particular spot 
in time (Anzac) but the story started before that and goes on into the future... it is a concrete 
telling of the story... every memorial is equally important as part of that story... and you need 
to see it that way in its entirety... When you come to an individual memorial it is much more 
personal... extreme significance for families who have lost people... even true for the [yet to be 
realised] Boer War memorial...’  (Fred, Focus Group 2)
The centre piece – the median with its constancy of colour – is important symbolically – 
while the scoria offering an ideal material to march on and the planter boxes are a spot to 
sit while waiting for ‘the action’ to start (Focus Group 1).
The fact that it is a parade – in name, in design and in its use – is vitally important,
‘Its name is important – it is a parade... you can fit a goodly number of servicemen on... they 
can be all seen at the same time... it’s our national parade ground... gives you a special feeling 
to march on it... it’s our democratic parade ground... an open vista’  (Fred, Focus Group 2)
Others reinforced the experience of marching on the parade, noting it has a special 
significance for Korean and Vietnam personnel as part of long-overdue recognition for 
their service.
The idea of the place as a precinct, with links visually and symbolically, is an important 
attribute.  For some it is hallowed ground.
Changing values and changing communities
Given that the importance of Anzac Parade for the wider community hinges to some extent 
on the connections to the concept of Anzac and to the largest public ceremonies held in 
Anzac Parade being Anzac Day (25 April) and Remembrance Day (11 November), the 
question arises as to whether the cultural connections to these two ceremonies will remain 
strong as generations pass, and with the increasingly multicultural nature of Australia.
This question was posed in the earlier conservation management plan for the Australian 
War Memorial, reflecting on ‘has the social significance of this place changed?’,
‘Today's Memorial visitor might be a veteran or the family of a veteran of the Second World 
War, or of Vietnam, but very many are also migrants or the Australian-born descendants of 
migrants who came to live in Australia after WWII, and who have no direct personal 
connection with Australia's involvement in war.  They may, however, have experienced war in 
the armed forces of other nations, or as civilians in countries directly affected by war, and 
indeed this may be the reason they migrated and become Australians.’  (Pearson & Crockett 
1995, pp. 50-52)
Inglis (2005, p. 477) comments that ‘in multicultural Australia, attachment to the cult of 
Anzac can transcend any common experience of war’, suggesting that these Anzac values 
can form a powerful point of attachment for newcomers to Australia, giving several 
examples.  These values are not of war, but rather of peace and coexistence.  Interestingly 
the Ataturk Memorial, one of the earlier memorials on Anzac Parade, offers precisely this 
expression.

Local places and a national place
How does Anzac Parade compare to the many other places that the Australian community 
or armed services communities use as a focus for remembrance of past armed conflicts, 
whether on a national, community or personal level?
Pearson & Crockett (1995, p. 51) note that,
‘Increasingly, as access has become easier, the battle fields and graves of Australian 
involvement overseas are becoming increasingly relevant in the context of social significance.’
Attending Anzac Day ceremonies at Gallipoli has become a part of pilgrimage for many 
Australians, and likewise trekking the Kokoda Track.
Neil James, Executive Director, Australia Defence Association, comments on the vista and 
its symbolism,
‘In conclusion, commemoration of the sacrifices made in war to protect contemporary 
Australia is a public and private duty of Australian citizenship.  It is best done by communities 
in their local war memorials across Australia.  Here in Canberra it is best done nationally by 
generic memorials on Anzac Parade and by the Australian War Memorial's roll-of-honour 
individually.  Finally, the very meaningful Parliament House – Australian War Memorial vista 
should be preserved and protected from the notion that every war, other operation or campaign, 
current political fashion or ethnic group needs to be commemorated individually.’  
(www.lakewarmemorialsforum.org/docs/23MarNeilJames.html, archived at 
https://webarchive.nla.gov.au/tep/157452)
Asked about the relative importance of Anzac Parade, with its memorials, compared to 
local memorials in every town and suburb across Australia, both focus groups talked about 
the different qualities of each type of ceremony,
‘in all the small towns the speakers and the key people are normally veterans – in Canberra it’s 
the representative of the political party in power – sometimes PM and sometimes the Governor 
General – but often it’s a junior minister (laughter)... sending along a junior minister is 
offensive’  (Focus Group 1)
‘at central coast... what I found was that it was very community centred... everybody came... so 
many people marching there is no audience... once the formal part was over everyone staying... 
it was a real community day... people stayed all day’  (Focus Group 1)
‘...Canberra is more symbolic – national government’  (Focus Group 1)
‘times have changed... each city has its own memorial of sorts... the Australian War Memorial 
is where the idea is cemented and in Anzac Parade’  (Focus Group 2)
‘Anzac Parade brings it home for the whole nation... it is the national capital and we need a 
national place... for us to commemorate in totality in a central place... this is ours... it is in 
danger of being whittled away because it doesn’t have the funding... it is part and parcel of 
maintaining national togetherness... where we bond together... where the national heart is and 
where the Anzac spirit keeps flowing...’  (Fred, Focus Group 2)

EVIDENCE OF OTHER VALUES
5.1 EXPERT-BASED VALUES – AESTHETICS AND CREATIVE ACHIEVEMENT
Landscape character
The landscape of the study area is part of the core of the National Capital.
Its development as a formal setting was driven by the visual corridor created between the 
Parliamentary Triangle and the Australian War Memorial along the Land Axis.  The 
corridor is a space defined by the visual connectivity of the ground plane treatments 
together with the symmetrical buildings and trees on each side and the dramatic impact of 
the terminating elevation of Mount Ainslie at one end and Capital Hill (Mount Kurrajong) 
at the other.
Anzac Parade had been more physically defined than the Parliamentary Triangle area by 
the two side roads giving access to the respective suburban edges of Campbell and Reid.  
Together with the central paved spaces, roads, paths and walls contribute to a hard edge 
treatment softened only by the grass verges and the flanking tree plantations.  Another 
important quality is the rising ground from Constitution Avenue up towards the Australian 
War Memorial and Mount Ainslie.
The landscape character is derived from the composition and perceptual experience of 
different landscape types.  The landscape types include the following.
Landform (i) Mounding
(ii) Terracing
(iii) Gentle Slopes
Design
(i) Symmetry
(ii) Repetition
(iii) Order
(iv) Colour
Built Form
(i) Walls
(ii) Ramp
(iii) Roads
(iv) Structures
(v) Hard pavement
(vi) Memorials
(vii) Flagpoles
Vegetation
(i) Grassland
(ii) Mass planting: Trees, shrubs and grasses
Anzac Parade is a product of the 1960s development by the then National Capital 
Development Commission and remains intact despite the introduction of various 
memorials regularly spaced along its length.  While memorials were originally allowed for 
in the design, there were not as many, and they were not originally intended to be as 
expressive and visually obvious – some have been located slightly out of the tree line into 
the Parade itself.
Visual and spatial structure
The physical definition of the Land Axis corridor has been primarily through a central, 
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
built and paved space defined by rows of trees of an essentially uniform height, colour and 
texture, with the suburbs extending beyond.
The Australian War Memorial complex creates a focal landscape to the northeast with 
Mount Ainslie clad with indigenous vegetation as a backdrop.  To the southwest, the Rond 
Point wall, Commonwealth Place walls, Old Parliament House and the new Parliament 
House align as a series of focal landscapes, with Red Hill acting as a backdrop.
The red gravel pavement, irrigated grassland (which provides a dramatic contrast with the 
gravel), the eucalyptus trees and the flagpoles (outside the study area) serve to unify Anzac 
Parade with the Australian War Memorial forecourt.
The use of eucalyptus trees also defines the central space of the Land Axis and links 
visually into the landscape setting on both sides of the lake’s Central Basin, as well as 
extending to the indigenous vegetation of both Mount Ainslie and Red Hill in the 
background settings.
The experiential qualities of the place change as one moves from the centreline of the Land 
Axis with its long vistas either way, to the sides along footpaths broken by outdoor 
‘rooms’ with or without memorials, and to within the treed area with relative intimateness 
and dryland grasses underfoot contrasting with the irrigated lawn areas at the road verges.
The design intention is not to parade along the middle but along the sides so as to 
encounter the memorials.  This leaves the centre comparatively visually free, to strengthen 
the ceremonial nature of this section of the Land Axis as its most formal and hard 
expression playing on the colour contrasts of red and green.
The memorials at each end of Anzac Parade tend to spatially weaken the composition, 
more so at the northeastern end adjacent to the Australian War Memorial forecourt and the 
Limestone Avenue intersection.

There is no evidence of scientific value related to Anzac Parade.
None the less, the trees in the Parade contribute to an urban wildlife corridor for migratory 
bird species (ACT Natural Resource Management Council 2009).

ANALYSIS OF EVIDENCE
6.1 INTRODUCTION TO ANALYSIS
This analysis has been prepared by the consultants using the evidence presented in 
Chapters 3-5 which has been analysed against the National Heritage criteria (reproduced at 
Appendix D), and judgements have been reached on the basis of the professional expertise 
of the consultants.  National Heritage assessment guidelines (Australian Heritage Council 
2009) in particular provide the indicators used in assessing social and aesthetic values.
The analysis is divided into sections related to the criteria.
This analysis generally considers values related to Anzac Parade overall, rather than those 
individual values which are tied to a specific and small components of the area.  For 
example, the analysis does not consider the individual associations with or values of every 
memorial along the Parade.  However, the values of the collection of memorials are 
important in the broader context, and are considered.
6.2 ANALYSIS AGAINST CRITERIA
(a)
the place has outstanding heritage value to the nation because of the place’s 
importance in the course, or pattern, of Australia’s natural or cultural history
Anzac Parade has outstanding heritage value because of its role in the development and 
national life of Canberra as Australia’s national capital.
Anzac Parade is a conspicuous and major part of the Land Axis, and its concept is strongly 
associated with the Griffins’ vision and plan for Canberra, as a major structural planning 
element around which the city was conceived and developed.
The realisation of Anzac Parade and other elements of the city has to some extent reflected 
the Griffins’ design but there have also been departures from it, and subsequent designs  
The realised design is more than just the surviving elements of the Griffins’ design, and it 
is rather the work of many hands and the creation of several layers of urban planning and 
design over 100 years.  The work of the NCDC in the 1960s has dramatically re-
conceptualised Anzac Parade in response to the changed character of the northern Land 
Axis through the placement of the Australian War Memorial at the base of the terminal 
point – Mount Ainslie.  The overall result is a layering of designs which have built upon 
and consciously departed from the Griffins’ original design intent.  In historical terms, this 
complex, evolving design is an important part of the story of the national capital, the Land 
Axis and Anzac Parade in particular.
Anzac Parade is part of an area, the Parliament House Vista, which is unique within 
Australia as an ongoing realisation of the establishment of a national place in an attempt to 
give a strong identity to the core of the national capital.
Anzac Parade is also of outstanding heritage value given its role in national 
commemorative activities related to war since 1965, contributing to the development of 
Australian cultural life and national identity.  Anzac Day is a particular focus of

Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
commemoration.  The Australian War Memorial from 1941 is an important precursor to 
the development and later role of the Parade.
The Australian War Memorial and, to a lesser extent, the other memorials in the Parade 
have and continue to play a very important role in fostering aspects of national identity.  
The various wars in which Australia has participated have had a major impact on its people 
and their history.  While there are many other memorials in Australia which commemorate 
wars and those who died, only the Australian War Memorial serves as a national shrine for 
all Australians, and the Memorial and Anzac Parade continue to serve as a focus for 
commemoration.
Collectively, the individual memorials are also the ongoing focus of substantial national 
commemorative activities.
The commemoration of war has been a major theme in Australia’s national history, and 
Anzac Parade, while not an early expression of this theme, has become an important 
national focus.
Summary
Anzac Parade meets this criterion because of its role in the development and national life 
of Canberra as Australia’s national capital.
(b)
the place has outstanding heritage value to the nation because of the place’s 
possession of uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of Australia’s natural or 
cultural history
Anzac Parade is rare within Australia as it commemorates the Anzac spirit and the 
relationship between Australia and New Zealand in the form of a formal symbolic 
landscape composition.
Anzac Parade may be compared with other commemorative roads with a specific Anzac 
connection, such as Anzac Parade in Sydney from 1917, the axis along Swanston Street to 
St Kilda road (part of Robert Hoddle’s Melbourne grid laid out in 1837) and on to the 
Shrine of Remembrance in Melbourne from 1934, and Anzac Highway in Adelaide.  There 
are also many other commemorative roads in Australia, such as the Remembrance 
Driveway from Sydney to Canberra instituted in 1954, as well as honour avenues such as 
that at Ballarat from 1917, and in many other States.  These roads often have some 
landscape quality, especially through tree plantings.  In the case of honour avenues, 
individual trees often commemorate specific individuals.
In addition, there are other types of commemorative places such as Anzac Square in 
Brisbane from 1930, and the Anzac War Memorial in Sydney from 1934.  Anzac Square is 
also a formal symbolic design.
Anzac Parade in Canberra appears to have a stronger formal symbolic landscape 
composition compared to the other commemorative roads, although there is a symbolic 
component to them all.  Anzac Parade is embedded into the planning and design of the 
national capital in both a pragmatic and functional way, as part of Griffin’s Land Axis, but 
also as a place which expresses visually and physically both the commemorative nature of 
the place and the strong connections with New Zealand.  It expresses a more overt 
symbolism of the Australian and New Zealand relationship.

Summary
Anzac Parade meets this criterion as a rare form of commemoration of the Anzac spirit and 
connection between Australia and New Zealand.
(c)
the place has outstanding heritage value to the nation because of the place’s 
potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Australia’s 
natural or cultural history
There is no evidence of value under this criterion.
(d)
the place has outstanding heritage value to the nation because of the place’s 
importance in demonstrating the principal characteristics of:
(i)
a class of Australia’s natural or cultural places; or
(ii)
a class of Australia’s natural or cultural environments
Anzac Parade may be considered in the classes of commemorative places or landscapes or 
vistas, perhaps especially commemorative roads, and parade grounds.  As noted under 
Criterion (b), there are a range of commemorative roads and other places in Australia.
However, these classes of places are not well understood and the principal characteristics 
have not been defined.  A meaningful assessment is therefore not possible.
None the less, as a parade ground Anzac Parade would not obviously appear to be a good 
example.  Commonly parade grounds are large, rectangular, open and level areas with 
perimeter features.  Anzac Parade has perhaps only a few of these qualities.
(e)
the place has outstanding heritage value to the nation because of the place’s 
importance in exhibiting particular aesthetic characteristics valued by a community 
or cultural group
Applying aesthetic significance indicators to the Anzac Parade data
The following presentation of values and attributes looks at each of the three identified 
communities separately, while recognising that there is naturally some overlap between 
these communities.  The communities are:
•
Australians;
•
the Canberra community;  and
•
the armed services community – including the Defence forces, service personnel 
(serving and retired), service families, service organisations, and others with 
particular connections to the memorials on or in Anzac Parade/Park.
In relation to aesthetic values, the predominant data is on the Canberra community, but the 
snapshot analysis indicates appreciation of similar qualities by visitors.  The Australian and 
Canberra communities are therefore presented together.
Australian and Canberra communities
The Parliament House Vista heritage management plan suggests that Parliament House 
Vista is amongst the ‘most highly recognised part of Canberra for Australians’ and this is 
supported by the ways Canberra is presented to visitors (Marshall and others 2010b, vol. 1, 
p. 141).
The Vista, or perhaps more accurately the Land Axis views, evokes ‘Canberra’ and 
‘national capital’.  It is the most commonly used image to represent Canberra and this is 
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
evident in artistic representations, snapshots and tourism images.
Two principal icons ‘hold’ each end of the Land Axis – the Australian War Memorial and 
Parliament House.  Anzac Parade is a distinctive and visually strong formal element in this 
powerful and symbolic landscape, and a key part of the design vision for Canberra.
The visual power of the landscape is strongly evident in the Parliament House Vista 
heritage management plan assessment, even though this assessment is looking at only one 
of the possible viewpoints.  Anzac Parade is a distinctive element within that sightline, and 
its form, colour and simplicity appear to be highly valued aesthetic qualities.
Lake Burley Griffin is similarly a key element in the Land Axis, and values studies of the 
lake have revealed the importance of the view from Parkes Way to the Australian War 
Memorial and Anzac Parade, at least to Canberrans, though it does not seem too much of a 
stretch to say that Australians who have visited Canberra would also share these values.
The National Heritage listing for the Australian War Memorial and the Memorial Parade 
recognises Anzac Parade as a ‘national landmark that is highly valued by the Australian 
community’ and as making a ‘major contribution to the principal views’ along the Land 
Axis, recognising ‘the views from Anzac Parade to the Hall of Memory and from the Hall 
of Memory along the land axis [sic]’ as outstanding.
The earlier ACT Heritage citation (1998) notes the ‘vista down the Parade is among the 
most recognised images of Canberra’, assessing Anzac Parade to be of aesthetic 
significance to all Australians.
The investigations undertaken as part of this plan support these contentions.  Within this 
understanding of broader landscape values, Anzac Parade has outstanding aesthetic values 
as an element of a larger whole.  Anzac Parade is an iconic element of the Land Axis, and 
is itself a highly recognised and recognisable place.
While not the subject of an extensive collection of significant art, Anzac Parade is amongst 
the most photographed of Canberra places, with the symmetrical strength of the landscape 
composition and the dramatic contrast of the central red median within the framing 
eucalypts set against the soft bush backdrop of Mount Ainslie.  The most common images 
look down Anzac Parade from the Australian War Memorial and this view seems to 
strengthen the symbolic meanings and its emotional power, with the ‘bloodshed’ red of the 
gravel dominant.  Similarly, the vast scale of the Parade and the sweep of history and 
tradition it reflects are breathtaking.  This is truly a powerful urban landscape.
For those who attend commemorative events within Anzac Parade, the contrast between 
the scale of the landscape and the intimacy and personal connections likely to be felt also 
indicate the power of this landscape to generate emotional responses.  And it is a landscape 
so redolent with history, events of national importance and personal connections, it has 
certainly the power to inspire.  While this may not be expressed through art, it is evident in 
snapshots and in the growing number of people from the wider community who participate 
in major ceremonies.
Armed services community
The existing National Heritage listing for the Australian War Memorial and Memorial 
Parade does not recognise the armed services community, as defined in this plan, as 
holding particular aesthetic values in relation to Anzac Parade.  The preparation of this 
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
plan has enabled consideration of those values, and could be used to enhance the National 
Heritage citation and to manage for those values.
The symbolism represented in the form and design of Anzac Parade, as well as in the 
individual memorials, is felt strongly by those from the armed services community.  Their 
responses were both intellectual and emotional.
For example, they spoke of the importance of the central median for its constancy of 
colour, recognition of the ‘bloodshed’ symbol represented there, and the importance that 
this element be ever-present and visually represented.  They spoke of the visual and 
symbolic nature of the design with its openness – like the Australian landscape of open 
plains, as well as the openness of our democracy – and of the contrast and sense of shelter 
created by the most Australian of all trees – eucalypts.
Conclusions
Based on the evidence presented, it is concluded that Anzac Parade has aesthetic qualities 
that are valued by both the Australian and Canberra communities.  The valued qualities are 
largely identical and have therefore been presented together.  Further, the National 
Heritage values are considered to provide a good reflection of the aesthetic values 
identified through the present assessment.
The present study suggests, however, that the symbolic nature of the design of Anzac 
Parade and the memorials themselves heightens its emotional power, and warrants 
recognition.
The aesthetic qualities that are particularly appreciated are the:
•
formal, linear design;
•
sweeping scale and extent of the vista;
•
openness contrasting with enclosure;
•
colour;  and
•
symbolic and experiential qualities.
Based on the evidence presented, it is concluded that Anzac Parade has aesthetic qualities 
that are also valued by the armed services community.  The values identified substantially 
add to the National Heritage values.
The aesthetic qualities that are particularly appreciated are the same as those noted above.
Summary
Anzac Parade is valued by the Australian and Canberra communities for its aesthetic 
qualities as an integral and deeply meaningful part of the Land Axis landscape, and is 
considered to meet the National Heritage threshold by having outstanding heritage value 
for the nation.
For the armed services community, Anzac Parade is highly valued for the symbolism 
embodied in its aesthetic qualities and it is considered to meet the National Heritage 
threshold by having outstanding heritage value for the nation.

(f)
the place has outstanding heritage value to the nation because of the place’s 
importance in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a 
particular period
The conceptualisation of what became Anzac Parade, as part of the Land Axis, in the idea 
of Canberra as a city in a landscape is recognised as being a great creative achievement by 
Walter Burley Griffin.  While the function of Griffin’s original Prospect Parkway changed 
after World War 2, the role of Anzac Parade as a part of the Land Axis remains as one of 
the major and fundamental components of the planned city.
The outstanding heritage value related to the creative achievement of the Parliament House 
Vista, which is a core part of the planned city and includes Anzac Parade, is extensively 
discussed in the heritage management plan for the Vista (Marshall and others 2010b, vol. 
1, pp. 141-159).  It notes,
‘The study area displays characteristics of the City Beautiful approach to urban planning with 
its objectives of beauty and monumental grandeur through the use of such features as axes, 
vistas, wide boulevards (ie. Commonwealth and Kings Avenues, actually outside the area), 
spacious parks and large graceful public buildings.  In addition, there are Garden City 
influences such as the landscaped, low density development with tree-lined streets, parkways, 
parks and gardens.  While the evolved design of Canberra overall has a combination of City 
Beautiful and Garden City influences, the City Beautiful influences are more distinct in the 
Parliament House Vista area than elsewhere in the city…’
Taylor also recognises the contribution of many others to the realisation of the city, in 
particular Weston.  As a general appraisal, he writes,
‘What we now have [in the National Triangle] is a serenely elegant space where the large scale 
and dignity are valued by many Canberrans and visitors, in contrast to the view that it is a 
space waiting to be filled with buildings in part to reflect Griffin’s urban piazza imagery.  But 
few could not be other than inspired by the view down the land axis, with its predominant 
symmetry across the lake to Mount Ainslie: an inspired view where the symbolic formal 
landscape is in compelling dynamic tension with the bush clad image of Mount Ainslie.  It 
surely ranks in its historic context, meaning and composition as one of the finest views across a 
city anywhere…’  (Taylor 2006, p. 139)
In addition to the Land Axis, other important and obvious components of the planned city 
include the National Triangle with its bounding avenues, especially Commonwealth and 
Kings Avenues which are better realised, the Parliamentary Zone, Water Axis, the lake, the 
Central Parklands (Commonwealth Park, Rond Terraces and Kings Park), City Hill, the 
other main avenues and approach routes, as well as the other circles associated with 
planning nodes.
Anzac Parade demonstrates a formal approach to landscape design which reflects both the 
structure of the Land Axis and the nature of commemorative places.  In a creative sense it 
integrates these two qualities in a symbolic manner.
The Parade uses formality and a symbolic contrast through plant selection and ultimately 
the character of the expression of that planting.  That is, the eucalyptus formal planting 
with dryland grass species expresses an informality reflecting a distinctly Australian 
quality, whilst the use of New Zealand plants constrained by formal planting beds reflects 
a more serious and committed quality, thereby creating a sense of contrast.  Yet both 
plantings belong within the overall formal composition, and contribute to the Anzac 
symbolism.

Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan

There are many formal, commemorative landscape designs in Australia.  Examples are 
noted under Criterion (b) above – some with an Anzac connection (such as Anzac Square 
in Brisbane), some relating otherwise to war commemoration (such as honour avenues of 
trees), all having landscape and symbolic qualities, and most/many having a formal 
landscape quality to some extent.  Cemeteries and churchyards are another large group of 
places which also often have formal, commemorative landscape components (there are 
many possible examples, such as the Woden Cemetery (1936) in the ACT).
In these contexts, Anzac Parade is an important component of a plan and landscape of 
outstanding heritage value, and its current specific form is also outstanding as a highly 
symbolic and formal landscape.
The creative achievement of the individual memorials has not been assessed as part of this 
heritage management plan.  None the less, the collection of memorials represent a 
substantial creative achievement, reflecting changing and differing artistic responses over 
time to a commemorative purpose.
While the expressiveness of most of the memorials is contained within their landscape 
rooms, the New Zealand Memorial makes an important and distinctive contribution to the 
Parade.  The pair of memorial features act as symbolic and visual terminating features, 
providing a sense of the southern end of the memorial parade.  These appear as the last or 
first of the memorials which, fittingly, commemorate the New Zealand connection.  The 
form of the memorial is highly symbolic in this role – as two handles of the one basket, 
which also arc towards each other over the Parade – all to provide an end or start to the 
memorial section of the Parade.
One other built element deserves specific mention – the street lighting.  These lights 
display a high degree of care and quality in their design, and employ a design and materials 
well beyond standard street lights.  It is not just a matter of the individual lights, but the 
overall lighting composition has been carefully designed to enhance the visual quality of 
Anzac Parade.  The design of the light bases also embodies subtle military symbolism.  
The use of such a design reflects the policy of providing high quality design in the 
National Triangle.
Summary
Anzac Parade meets this criterion as part of the Land Axis and Parliament House Vista, as 
part of the core of the planned city of Canberra and a landscape of outstanding heritage 
value.  Its current specific form is also outstanding as a highly symbolic and formal 
landscape.
The collection of memorials represent a substantial creative achievement, reflecting 
changing and differing artistic responses over time to a commemorative purpose.  In 
addition, the New Zealand Memorial makes an important and distinctive contribution to 
the Parade as symbolic and visual terminating features, providing a sense of the southern 
end of the memorial parade.
The street lighting is also an important contributing element to the overall landscape of the 
Parade.

the place has outstanding heritage value to the nation because of the place’s 
strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, 
cultural or spiritual reasons
Applying indicators to the Anzac Parade data
Australians & Canberrans
The Parliament House Vista heritage management plan concluded that this place is 
strongly valued by the Canberra community as a landmark, a defining element for 
Canberra (Marshall and others 2010b, vol. 1, p. 176).  Anzac Parade is similarly part of 
Canberra’s distinctive signature.
Further, it is a part of ‘the heart of Canberra, the embodiment of Australian nationhood and 
democracy, and a place of national memory’.  The idea of Anzac Parade as part of the 
symbolic link between democracy and the price or consequences of democracy was 
apparent from a variety of sources, suggesting that this designed juxtaposition conveys 
powerful meanings to the viewer, and is a reference point in how Australians see 
themselves.
The question of whether this appreciation is changing or strengthening appears to have 
been answered by several authors (eg. Pearson & Crockett 1995;  Inglis 2005) as well as 
by Australians voting with their feet.  As is suggested in the ACT Heritage citation (1998) 
and reinforced by Inglis (2005), if Anzac Parade holds ‘a spiritual significance for the 
majority of Australians, especially those who have been affected by war or conflict’ then a 
growing number will appreciate its meanings, especially those who have come to Australia 
seeking to escape such conflict.  And at a time when Australians have again been involved 
in small but complex overseas conflicts, the relevance of Anzac Parade may continue to 
grow.
Unlike many war memorials around Australia, Anzac Parade also offers both a traditional 
and a contemporary perspective on war and conflict.  Some memorials are very traditional, 
and speak of past times, whereas others such as the New Zealand, Service Nurses and 
Peacekeeping memorials are strongly contemporary in the interpretation they present.
For Canberra residents there is a sense of pride and belonging evoked by the Vista, and a 
similar sentiment was revealed through the focus groups for Anzac Parade.
Interestingly, the Parliament House Vista heritage management plan indicated that 
Canberra residents did not believe that Australians as a whole actively recognise these 
values, and that the Canberra community holds these values ‘in trust for the nation until 
such time as they are recognised’ (Marshall and others 2010b, vol. 1, p. 161).  Certainly, 
when changes are proposed on the Land Axis, it appears to be Canberra residents who 
quickly step forward in the defence of these values, rather than it becoming a national 
debate.  Research for this plan suggests that these values are widely shared amongst 
Australians, through the reflections offered by the armed services community.
The values represented in Parliament House Vista were concluded to be both physical and 
symbolic, and to represent ‘a whole range of Australian intangible cultural values – 
nationhood, history, democracy, commemoration, national memory’ (Marshall and others 
2010b, vol. 1, p. 162).
The link between democracy and the ‘price’ or consequences of democracy arose in both 
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
focus groups and also in the interviews.  This was seen as a powerful counterpoint created 
through the positioning of the Australian War Memorial and Parliament at opposite ends of 
the axis, and one that that is widely appreciated in this landscape, as evidenced by visitors 
to Canberra.
The national perceptions study (Ritchie & Leon-Marillanca 2006) supports this contention, 
demonstrating the importance of the Land Axis and its two notional end-point buildings for 
their symbolic embodiment of national values linked to Australia’s Defence force history, 
democracy and a broader sense of Australian history.
Perhaps this symbolism goes even further and is a symbol of Australia as a sovereign state 
and our relationship with other sovereign states.  The memorials associated with Greece, 
New Zealand and Turkey are examples, as is the tradition of senior officials from other 
countries visiting and laying wreaths at the Australian War Memorial, and sometimes at a 
memorial on Anzac Parade.  For both New Zealand and Greece for example, their 
memorials are a tangible reminder of past and present relationships between nations.  The 
meanings of these memorials and the place as a whole are shared with those representing 
some foreign countries here, and those who visit.  This aspect is worthy of further 
investigation.
Armed services community
Asked about the importance of Anzac Parade to Australians, focus group participants saw 
it as of outstanding importance.
Pearson & Crockett note,
‘There is a substantial sector of the community, the veterans organisations in particular, for 
whom the Memorial is still clearly a personalised symbol of Australia's war experience with 
which they feel very strongly and directly associated.  It is a sacred place dedicated to the 
memory of those who died in war.  The resurgence in public interest reflected in high 
attendances at Anzac day ceremonies, the opening of the Vietnam Memorial, and the interment 
of the Unknown Soldier, has been interpreted as pointing to a broadly based respect for, and 
interest in, Australia's involvement in war.  It has been interpreted by some we have 
interviewed as being part of the ongoing growth of interest in Australian history and 
nationalism.’  (Pearson & Crockett 1995, p. 51)
These sentiments were strongly reflected in the values arising from focus groups and 
interviews.
First, and perhaps most importantly, was the expression that these memorials and this place 
– Anzac Parade – is ‘ours’ – not as exclusive owners but rather because the memorials and 
Anzac Parade tell both the national Defence service stories but also represent thousands of 
individual stories.  Further, they recognise that people served – ‘they were there’.  The 
narrative represented is therefore both intensely personal and utterly national.  This place is 
where the nation recognises service and sacrifice in war – compared to the many places 
around Australia where the impact of war on individual communities is remembered.
Those who participated expressed a strong desire to be recognised as the stewards of their 
memorials and stories.
The memorials and Anzac Parade are for some with armed service associations a place of 
spiritual connection – sacred and hallowed spaces.  In these places, ceremony and ritual are 
important activities associated with remembrance.

Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan

Anzac Parade and the memorials are an important reference point in the sense of identity 
of the armed services community.  This is expressed through parades, ceremonies, wreath 
laying and other rituals, gatherings and so on.  Many of those who contributed to this 
investigation are actively involved in organising these activities.
Through the processes of gathering, community bonds are reinforced.  In the words of one 
participant there is a feeling of ‘being at one with those gathered’.  The memorials are 
places for reunion with the living as well as remembering the dead.
For some, especially those who do not have a grave to visit, the memorials may be the 
primary focus for their grief, just as memorials across Australia were for those grieving 
losses from the Boer War, and First and Second World Wars.
Conclusions
Based on the evidence presented, it is concluded that Anzac Parade has a strong and 
special association for the Australian and Canberra communities as a landmark with strong 
symbolic meanings, and as an important reference point in the way Australians see 
themselves.  Further it is a place open to many interpretations, allowing new conceptions 
of the meaning of war and peace to emerge over time in response to changing community 
experience.  It appears to be valued highly by representatives of other nations as a 
demonstration of the mutual regard in which each nation holds the other.
The National Heritage social values are considered to provide a good reflection of the 
values identified through the present assessment.  This assessment would suggest however, 
that the meanings of Anzac Parade are somewhat more complex and open to multiple 
readings.  This enhances its value and suggests it will be retained into the future.
For the armed services community, Anzac Parade and the memorials are places of 
outstanding importance to them as a symbol of service, respect and recognition.  For 
service and ex-service personnel it is closely connected to their sense of identity.  This is 
encompassed by it being ‘their place’.  It is a place in which they want to conduct 
ceremonies of remembrance and other activities that will reinforce community bonds.  For 
them and for families with service connections, specific memorials are a focus for grief.
Summary
Anzac Parade is valued by the Australian and Canberra communities for its strong and 
special associations for social, cultural, ceremonial and spiritual reasons and is therefore 
considered to meet the National Heritage threshold by having outstanding heritage value 
for the nation.

the place has outstanding heritage value to the nation because of the place’s

importance in Australia’s natural or cultural history
Anzac Parade clearly has outstanding heritage value for the special association with those 
who served in the armed forces, those who died, and for their families.  The discussion 
under Criterion (g) above is also relevant to this criterion.  These associations can relate to

particular memorials as well as the whole Parade, as places of national as well as personal 
commemoration.  This group of people is highly important in Australia’s history.  Wars 
and military service have been key defining themes in Australia’s history.
Anzac Parade is also associated with a number of designers, and such associations may 
meet this criterion.  In so far as every designer is associated with the thing he or she 
designs, it is not considered sufficient to regard this as a special association.  There must 
be an additional quality to the association.  The other dimension to the criterion is the 
importance of the person in Australia’s history.
The following table presents an analysis of a range of designers, drawn from the history 
and a variety of other sources, with a potential special association with the study area.

Richard 
Clough
NCDC architect/landscape architect from 1959, 
Director of the Landscape Division in 1972-80, 
coordinated the landscape works and plantings 
for the north bank of the Central Basin, 
supervised major design and implementation of 
works in Commonwealth Park, collaborated on 
the design of Anzac Parade with Gareth Roberts
Anzac Parade appears to have a special association 
with Clough as part of his overall work on the north 
bank of the Central Basin, on Commonwealth Park 
and Anzac Parade.  These were some of his major 
projects while with the NCDC.  In addition, Anzac 
Parade is the most prominent component.
Other places which may have a special association 
include Government House grounds extensions, 
Yarralumla, The Kings School, Parramatta and 
Macquarie University at Ryde.  The latter two being 
regarded as outstanding designs.  (Hambrett 2005)
Possibly, given the long and senior role played 
regarding the development of Canberra’s landscape, 
and afterwards as a Professor of Landscape 
Architecture at the University of NSW.
Walter Burley 
Griffin
Original lead designer of Canberra including the 
study area
The study area has a special association with Griffin, 
as part of the Land Axis and broader city design, even 
though the design and form of the Parade are 
significantly different to that apparently intended and 
initially realised.  The Canberra design is Griffin’s 
most important work.  The study area is a major part 
of the core of the design for Canberra, and is a key 
part of the design which has actually been realised, 
albeit in a modified form.  This special association 
probably extends to the full National Triangle 
including City Hill, Constitution Avenue and Russell.
Griffin may also have a special association with his 
house Pholiota at Eaglemont, Melbourne, with 
Newman College at the University of Melbourne, the 
Capitol Theatre also in Melbourne, and with 
Castlecrag in Sydney.  (Harrison 1983)
Yes, as the lead designer of the original plan for 
Canberra as the national capital.  Arguably Griffin is 
of outstanding importance in Australia’s history for 
this role.

STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
7.1 STATEMENT OF SIGNIFICANCE
This section begins with the formal National Heritage values.  This is followed by a 
suggested revised statement of significance for just the Anzac Parade part based on the 
research undertaken for this plan.  It should be noted that the formal National Heritage values 
are the basis for the policies presented in Chapter 9 below.
References to criteria in the following section relate to the National Heritage criteria 
(reproduced at Appendix D).

Australian War Memorial and Memorial Parade National Heritage Values
Criterion A Events, Processes
The AWM is an outstanding national museum and memorial, as expressed through the main building, the 
courtyard fabric, interior spaces, the Sculpture Garden and the collections.  The AWM was established as a 
direct consequence of the First World War, one of the seminal events in Australian history.  It embodied 
the vision of Charles Bean – Official First World War correspondent – that the war would be instrumental 
in creating a sense of nationhood and a distinctly Australian identity.  The institution plays a pivotal role in 
helping Australians to commemorate and understand the sacrifice and loss of Australians during war.
The AWM together with Anzac Parade is an important national icon.  Its major features include: the main 
building; the medieval stone lions at the entrance; the ceremonial landscape including the Lone Pine tree; 
and displays and sculptures.  The AWM and Anzac Parade are major venues for national commemorative 
services and events such as the ANZAC Day march.
Anzac Parade, as part of the Parliamentary Vista and an extension of the AWM, is part of one of the major 
designed landscapes of Australia.  A ceremonial space of this grandeur is unique in Australia.
The AWM and the memorials along Anzac Parade represent changing concepts of commemoration in 
Australia, influenced by the armed forces and community groups.  The Hall of Memory with the Tomb of 
the Unknown Australian Soldier, and aspects of its setting are notable.
Criterion B Rarity
The AWM building is a purpose built repository, reflecting the integral relationship between the building, 
commemorative spaces and the collections.  This is unique in Australia and rare elsewhere in the world.  
The values are expressed in the fabric of the main building, the entrance, the Hall of Memory, the 
collections and the surrounding landscape.
The AWM collection contains unique objects including a Lancaster bomber and the largest collection of 
Victoria Crosses in the world.  The building contains rare elements, notably the medieval stone lions at the 
entrance and the Hall of Memory with its largest mosaics in the world.
Anzac Parade, as part of the Parliamentary Vista and as an extension of the AWM, is part of one of the 
major cultural landscapes of Australia.  The grandeur of the ceremonial space is not found elsewhere in 
Australia.  Anzac Parade is nationally important for its public and commemorative functions.
Criterion C Research
The AWM has a unique and important function in the nation in collecting and displaying objects and 
records on Australians’ experience of war.  The AWM and other institutions have used these materials to 
produce research on social, political and military history.  The place has the potential to yield further 
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
substantial information on Australians’ experience of war.  These values are expressed through the 
collections.
Criterion E Aesthetic characteristics
The AWM in its setting is of outstanding importance for its aesthetic characteristics, valued as a place of 
great beauty by the Australian community and veteran groups (as represented by the Returned & Services 
League of Australia).  The place has evoked strong emotional and artistic responses from Australian and 
overseas visitors.  The main building and the surrounding landscape, the Hall of Memory, the Roll of 
Honour, ANZAC Hall and the collections act as reminders of important events and people in Australia's 
history and trigger disturbing and poignant responses from the vast majority of visitors.
The AWM together with Anzac Parade form an important national landmark that is highly valued by the 
Australian community.  As part of the Parliamentary Vista, the AWM makes a major contribution to the 
principal views from both Parliament Houses and Mount Ainslie.  Views from Anzac Parade to the Hall of 
Memory, and from the Hall of Memory along the land axis are outstanding.  Its prominent position is 
important due to its relative visual isolation on the Griffin land axis, amid the backdrop of the forested 
slopes of Mount Ainslie.  The visual impact of the AWM when viewed from Parliament House and other 
points along Griffin's land axis including Mount Ainslie; and the fabric of Anzac Parade including the 
memorials, plantings and lighting is far more distinctive and dramatic compared to the other principal war 
memorials in Australia
Criterion G Social value
The AWM is the national war museum and national shrine, and together with Anzac Park, has special 
associations for the Australian community, particularly veterans and their families.  These special 
associations are reinforced on ANZAC Day and at ceremonies specific to particular memorials on Anzac 
Parade.  The AWM and the Anzac Parade memorials are the nation’s major focal point for 
commemoration including the ANZAC Day march and other ceremonies and events.  These values are 
expressed through: the AWM building (including the Hall of Memory); the collection; the surrounding 
landscape (including the Sculpture Garden); and Anzac Parade including the memorials.
Criterion H Significant people
The AWM building and the Anzac Parade memorials have special associations with Australia’s military 
forces and veterans represented by the Returned & Services League of Australia.
The AWM's success as a shrine, a museum, an architectural form and part of Canberra's urban plan is 
partly the result of its special associations with the lives and works of people who have been significant in 
Australia's history.  These include the AWM’s founders Charles Bean, John Treloar and Sir Henry Gullett.
The values are expressed in the fabric of the place which includes: the main building; the Hall of Memory; 
the collections; the surrounding landscape; and Anzac Parade.
Anzac Parade – Suggested Revised Values
Anzac Parade (the National Heritage section between Constitution Avenue and the Australian 
War Memorial) is of outstanding heritage value because of its importance in Australia’s 
history, as a rare form of commemoration of the relationship between Australia and New 
Zealand, for its aesthetic qualities, its creative achievement, social values and special 
associations.  Many of these values are shared with or related to the adjacent Australian War 
Memorial, and the Parade and Memorial are a single National Heritage place.  Anzac Parade 
also makes a substantial contribution to the Commonwealth Heritage values of the Parliament 
House Vista area.
Anzac Parade has outstanding heritage value to the nation because of its important role in the 
development and national life of Canberra as Australia’s national capital.  Each and every 
local and capital city equivalent, whether a memorial, community facility or avenue of trees 
that is dedicated to the same commemorative purpose, is symbolically linked to the 
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

sentiments that find their national expression in Anzac Parade and the Australian War 
Memorial.
Anzac Parade is of outstanding heritage value given its role in national commemorative 
activities related to war since 1965, contributing to the development of Australian cultural life 
and national identity.  Anzac Day is a particular focus of commemoration.  The Australian 
War Memorial from 1941 is an important precursor to the development and later role of the 
Parade.
The Australian War Memorial and, to a lesser extent, the other memorials in the Parade have 
and continue to play a very important role in fostering aspects of national identity.  The 
various wars in which Australia has participated have had a major impact on its people and 
their history.  While there are many other memorials in Australia which commemorate wars 
and those who died, only the Australian War Memorial serves as a national shrine for all 
Australians, and the Memorial and Anzac Parade continue to serve as a focus for 
commemoration.
Collectively, the individual memorials are also the ongoing focus of substantial national 
commemorative activities.
The commemoration of war has been a major theme in Australia’s national history, and 
Anzac Parade, while not an early expression of this theme, has become an important national 
focus.
Anzac Parade is also a conspicuous and major part of the Land Axis, and its concept is 
strongly associated with the Griffins’ vision and plan for Canberra, as a major structural 
planning element around which the city was conceived and developed.  While the work of the 
National Capital Development Commission in the 1960s has dramatically re-conceptualised 
Anzac Parade in response to the changed character of the northern Land Axis through the 
placement of the Australian War Memorial, the overall result is a layering of designs.  In 
historical terms, this complex, evolving design is an important part of the story of the national 
capital, the Land Axis and Anzac Parade in particular.
(Criterion (a))
Anzac Parade is of outstanding heritage value by being rare within Australia in 
commemorating the Anzac spirit and the relationship between Australia and New Zealand 
through a formal symbolic landscape composition.
The Parade appears to have a comparatively stronger formal symbolic landscape composition 
than other such places, and it is also more overt in its symbolism of the Australian and New 
Zealand link.
(Criterion (b))
Anzac Parade is of outstanding heritage value because its aesthetic qualities are widely 
recognised across the Australian and Canberra communities, and in the armed services 
community.  It is recognised as a powerful and iconic place, and its purpose and meanings are 
widely recognised, and add to its power to move people emotionally.

Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan

Anzac Parade, as major part of the Land Axis, is part of Canberra’s signature.
Individual memorials offer powerful experiences of place and time, especially for those with 
a connection to that memorial, but also for visitors who choose to engage more closely.
(Criterion (e))
Anzac Parade is important as part of the Land Axis and Parliament House Vista, as part of the 
core of the planned city of Canberra, and as a landscape of outstanding heritage value.  Its 
current specific form is also outstanding as a highly symbolic and formal landscape.  While 
the original function of what is now Anzac Parade changed, especially after World War 2, its 
role as a part of the Land Axis remains as one of the major and fundamental components of 
the planned city.
Anzac Parade is also outstanding as a highly symbolic and formal landscape.  It demonstrates 
a formal approach to landscape design and symmetry which reflects both the structure of the 
Land Axis and the nature of commemorative places.  In a creative sense it integrates these 
two qualities in a symbolic manner.  The Parade uses formality and a symbolic contrast 
through plant selection, and ultimately the character of the expression of that planting.  The 
Australian and New Zealand plantings contribute to the Anzac symbolism.  The formal 
design also works to integrate the Australian War Memorial landscape with the Land Axis 
generally.
The collection of memorials represent a substantial creative achievement, reflecting changing 
and differing artistic responses over time to a commemorative purpose.  In addition, the New 
Zealand Memorial makes an important and distinctive contribution to the Parade as symbolic 
and visual terminating features, providing a sense of the southern end of the memorial parade.  
These appear as the last of the memorials which, fittingly, commemorate the New Zealand 
connection.  The form of the memorial is highly symbolic in this role – as two handles of the 
one basket, which also arc towards each other over the Parade – all to provide an end to the 
memorial section of the Parade.
The street lighting is also an important contributing element to the overall landscape of the 
Parade.  It displays a high degree of care and quality in its design and materials, and the 
overall lighting composition has been carefully designed to enhance the visual quality of 
Anzac Parade.
(Criterion (f))
Anzac Parade has outstanding heritage value because it symbolises key ideas about being 
Australian, and is a reference point in how Australians see themselves.  For Canberrans, 
Anzac Parade is part of the highly valued Land Axis and vista, a formal landscape that is a 
source of pride.
Anzac Parade and specific memorials represent valued past and contemporary relationships 
between nations.
The memorials in Anzac Parade hold deep meanings for people associated with military 
service, their families and colleagues.

Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
Anzac Parade symbolises service, sacrifice and armed services traditions, and for some 
demonstrates how democracy is maintained and at what price.
Anzac Parade symbolically tells the many stories of those who served in Australia’s defence 
forces overseas – it contributes to their understanding of their own experience, and is a place 
where people go to remember and reconnect.
Anzac Parade and specific memorials are a focus for grief and grieving.
Individual memorials and the memorials as a whole are highly valued by the armed services 
community for the recognition they offer to those who served, especially for those whose 
service lacked recognition and respect at the time.
The space at each memorial and the space of Anzac Parade is highly valued by the armed 
services community as a place for ceremony, commemoration and ritual, both personal and 
shared.
(Criterion (g))
Anzac Parade has outstanding heritage value because of special associations with those who 
served in the armed forces, those who died, and for their families.  These associations can 
relate to particular memorials as well as the whole Parade, as places of national as well as 
personal commemoration.  This group of people is highly important in Australia’s history 
because wars and military service have been key defining themes in Australia’s history.
The Parade also has a special association with Walter Burley Griffin and Marion Mahony 
Griffin, as part of the Land Axis and broader city design.  The Canberra design is the 
Griffins’ most important work.  The study area is a major part of the core of the design for 
Canberra, and is a key part of the design which has actually been realised, albeit in a 
modified form.  The Griffins are important figures in Australia’s history for their role in 
designing the national capital.
