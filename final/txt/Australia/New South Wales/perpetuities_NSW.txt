but does not include an Act of Parliament.
the rule against perpetual trusts means the common law rule that invalidates a

trust and trustee have the meanings respectively ascribed thereto in the Trustee Act
1925.
will includes a codicil.
(2) For the purposes of this Act, a will shall, in relation to a disposition contained in it, be
deemed to take effect on the death of the testator.
(3) For the purposes of this Act:
(a) a person shall be treated as a member of a class if in that person’s case each and
every condition identifying a member of the class is satisfied, and
(b) a person shall be treated as a potential member of a class if in that person’s case
only one or some of the conditions identifying a member of the class is or are
satisfied but there is a possibility that the remainder of those conditions will in
time be satisfied.
4
Application
(1) Except as provided by sections 11, 12 and 13, this Act does not apply in relation to a
settlement taking effect before the appointed day.
(2) This Act applies in relation to a settlement exercising a power of appointment,
whether general or special, and taking effect on or after the appointed day, whether
or not it applies in relation to the settlement creating the power of appointment.
(3) This Act does not apply to render invalid, at the outset or at some future time, an
interest created by a provision of a will executed before the appointed day, but taking
effect on or after the appointed day, if the provision would not have infringed the rule
against perpetuities had this Act not been enacted and had the will taken effect when
it was executed.
5
The Crown
(1) Except as provided by subsection (2) or by any other Act, the rule against
perpetuities, the rule against perpetual trusts and this Act bind the Crown not only in
right of New South Wales but also, so far as the legislative power of Parliament

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
permits, the Crown in all its other capacities.
(2) Nothing in the rule against perpetuities, in the rule against perpetual trusts or in this
Act affects any settlement made by the Crown.
6
Powers of appointment
(1) For the purposes of the rule against perpetuities, a power of appointment shall at any
particular time be treated as a special power unless, at that time, the appointor has,
by the settlement creating the power, unconditional authority at his or her own
discretion to exercise the power by appointing the interest the subject of the power to
himself or herself.
(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), an appointment of an interest made by will under a
power of appointment that would, but for the fact that it was made exercisable only by
will, have been a general power shall be treated as a general power for the purposes
of determining whether the appointment of the interest infringes the rule against
perpetuities.
(3) For the purposes of this section, an authority is unconditional notwithstanding any
formal condition relating to the mode of exercise of the power.
7
The perpetuity period
(1) For the purposes of the rule against perpetuities, the perpetuity period applicable to
an interest created by a settlement shall be 80 years from the date on which the
settlement takes effect.
(2) Where an appointment of an interest is made under a special power of appointment,
the perpetuity period shall be reckoned from the date on which the settlement
creating the power takes effect.
8
Wait-and-see
(1) Where a provision of a settlement which creates an interest would, but for this section
and section 9, infringe the rule against perpetuities, the interest shall be treated, until
such time (if any) as it becomes certain that it must vest, if at all, after the end of the
perpetuity period, as if the provision did not infringe that rule, and its becoming so
certain does not affect the validity of any thing previously done in relation to the
interest.
(2) Where a provision of a settlement which creates an interest consisting of the
conferring of a general power of appointment would, but for this section and section 9,
infringe the rule against perpetuities, the interest shall be treated, until such time (if
any) as it becomes certain that the power will not be exercisable within the perpetuity
period, as if the provision did not infringe that rule.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3) Where a provision of a settlement which creates an interest consisting of the
conferring of any power or right (except a general power of appointment) would, but
for this section and section 9, infringe the rule against perpetuities, the interest shall
be treated as regards any exercise of the power or right within the perpetuity period
as if the provision did not infringe that rule, and the provisions shall be treated as
infringing that rule only if and so far as the power or right is not fully exercised within
the perpetuity period.
(4) This section does not affect the operation of section 15.
9
Reduction of age and exclusion of class members
(1) Where:
(a) a provision of a settlement creates an interest and the vesting of the interest
depends on the attainment by any person of a specified age, and
(b) it becomes apparent that the provision would, but for this subsection, infringe the
rule against perpetuities but that it would not infringe that rule if the specified age
had been a lesser age,
the interest shall, for all purposes, be treated as if, instead of its vesting depending on
the attainment by the person of the specified age, its vesting depended on the
attainment by the person of the greatest age which, if put in place of the specified
age, would save the provision from infringing that rule.
(2) Where an interest to which subsection (1) applies is ulterior to any other interest
created by the settlement, that other interest shall not be defeated or otherwise
adversely affected by the operation of subsection (1).
(3) Where, in relation to an interest created by a provision of a settlement, different ages
are specified in relation to different persons:
(a) the reference in subsection (1) to the specified age shall be construed as a
reference to all the specified ages, and
(b) subsection (1) shall operate to reduce each such age so far as is necessary to
save the provision from infringing the rule against perpetuities.
(4) Where a provision of a settlement creates an interest which is to be taken by a class
of persons and it becomes apparent that the inclusion of a person, being a member of
the class or an unborn person who at birth would become a member or potential
member of the class, would, but for this subsection:
(a) cause the provision to infringe the rule against perpetuities, or
(b) prevent subsection (1) from operating to save the provision from infringing that
rule,

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
then, upon its so becoming apparent, the person shall, unless the exclusion of the
person would exhaust the class, be treated in relation to the interest as if the person
were not a member of the class, and, where subsection (1) applies that subsection
shall thereupon have effect accordingly.
(5) Where this section has effect in relation to a provision to which section 8 applies, the
operation of this section does not affect the validity of any thing previously done in
relation to the interest created by the provision.
10

in the following order:
(a) section 8,

exchange trust property and any other power of a trustee, but does not include a
power to appoint, pay, transfer, advance, apply, distribute or otherwise deal with trust
property in or towards satisfaction of the interest of a beneficiary under the trust or in
or towards satisfaction of a purpose of the trust.
(2) The rule against perpetuities does not invalidate an administrative power in relation
to trust property during the subsistence of a beneficial interest in the trust property.
(3) This section applies to an administrative power taking effect, and to any exercise of
an administrative power, before, on or after the appointed day.
12
Remuneration of trustees

Determinable interests

which is, by a provision of the settlement, determinable on a contingency.
subsequent interest, in relation to a determinable interest created by a settlement,
means an interest, whether vested or contingent:
(a) created by the settlement, or remaining undisposed of by the settlement, or
taking effect by way of reverter, resulting trust, residuary gift or otherwise on a
possibility arising under the settlement, and
(b) as regards which the determinable interest is a prior interest.
(2) The rule against perpetuities applies to render invalid the provision for determination
of a determinable interest created by a settlement in the same manner as the rule
would apply to render invalid a condition subsequent in the settlement for defeasance
of the determinable interest on the same contingency, and where that rule does so
apply:
(a) the determinable interest shall not be so determinable, and

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) a subsequent interest not itself rendered invalid by that rule shall be postponed or
defeated to the extent necessary to allow the determinable interest to have effect
free from the provision for determination.
(3) For the purposes of this section, an interest created by, or a provision in, an
appointment or other exercise of a power in a settlement (except a general power of
appointment) shall be treated as an interest created by, or a provision in, the
settlement.

trusts, be 80 years from the date on which the settlement takes effect.
(3) Where, by a settlement, there is a disposition for a purpose and the disposition would,
but for this Act, infringe the rule against perpetual trusts, the disposition shall be
treated, until such time (if any) as it becomes certain that the disposition must
infringe that rule, as if it did not infringe that rule, and its so becoming certain does
not affect the validity of any thing previously done in relation to the disposition.
(4) This section does not apply to a disposition for a purpose which is charitable.
17
Dependent interests
(1) Where a provision of a settlement creates an interest, the provision is not rendered
invalid by the rule against perpetuities or the rule against perpetual trusts by reason
only that the interest is ulterior to and dependent upon an interest which is so invalid.
