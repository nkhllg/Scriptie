(a)
any dependants, whether kindred or not, of the intestate;
(b)

deemed to form part of the estate of the deceased to be
administered under the terms of the waiver for the benefit of
the person or persons in favour of whom the waiver is made.
(9)
A waiver under subsection (5) shall have the effect of a grant
of the land or other property of whatever kind the subject of

by escheat or devolution or as bona vacantia the public trustee
shall have and shall be deemed always to have had the same
power—
(a)
to obtain from the court or otherwise under the Public
Curator Act 1915 or the Public Trustee Act 1978
authority to administer the estate of such person; and

to keep or put premises in repair during the currency of a
lease, or to leave or put premises in repair at the termination of
a lease, whether such covenant, obligation or agreement is
expressed or implied, and whether general or specific, shall in
no case exceed the amount (if any) by which the value of the
reversion (whether immediate or not) in the premises is
diminished owing to the breach of such covenant, obligation,
or agreement, and in particular no damage shall be recovered
for a breach of any such covenant, obligation, or agreement to
leave or put premises in repair at the termination of a lease, if
it is shown that the premises, in whatever state of repair they
might be, would at or shortly after the termination of the lease
have been or be pulled down, or such structural alterations
made to the premises as would render valueless the repairs
covered by the covenant, obligation, or agreement.

A right of re-entry or forfeiture for a breach of any such
covenant, obligation, or agreement shall not be enforceable,
by action or otherwise, unless the lessor proves that the fact

to the person who last paid the rent due under the lease

service of the notice came to the knowledge of any such
person.

under-leases
(1)
In case any lease is duly surrendered in order to be renewed,
and a new lease made and executed by the head landlord, such
new lease shall without a surrender of all or any of the
under-leases, be as good and valid to all intents and purposes
as if all the under-leases derived out of that lease had been
likewise surrendered at or before the taking of such new lease.
(2)
Every person in whom any estate for life, or lives, or for years,
is from time to time vested because of such new lease and the
person’s executors and administrators shall be entitled to the
rents, covenants, obligations, and duties, and have like remedy
for the recovery of the rents, covenants, obligations and
duties, and the under-lessees shall hold and enjoy the lands in
the respective under-leases comprised, as if the original leases
out of which the respective under-leases are derived had been
still kept on foot and continued.
(3)
The head landlord shall be entitled to the same remedy by
entry in and upon the lands comprised in any such under-lease
for the rents and duties reserved by such new lease (so far as
the same do not exceed the rents and duties reserved in the
lease out of which such under-lease was derived) as the head
landlord would have had in case such former lease had been
still continued or as the head landlord would have had in case
the respective under-leases had been renewed under such new
principal lease.

estate to be deemed the reversion
(1)
When the reversion expectant on a lease of land made either
before or after the commencement of this Act is surrendered

in the lease, every condition or right of re-entry, and every
other condition contained in the lease, shall be apportioned,
and shall remain annexed to the severed parts of the
reversionary estate as severed, and shall be in force with
respect to the term on which each severed part is reversionary,
or the term in the part of the land as to which the term has not
been surrendered, or has not been avoided or has not
otherwise ceased, in like manner as if the land comprised in
each severed part, or the land as to which the term remains
subsisting, as the case may be, had alone originally been
comprised in the lease.

to and shall go with the reversionary estate in the land, or in
any part of the reversionary estate, immediately expectant on
the term granted by the lease, despite severance of that
reversionary estate, and without prejudice to any liability
affecting a covenantor or the covenantor’s estate.
(2)
Any such rent, covenant, obligation, or provision shall be
capable of being recovered, received, enforced, and taken
advantage of, by the person from time to time entitled, subject

estate, despite severance of that reversionary estate, and may
be taken advantage of and enforced by the person in whom the
term is from time to time vested by conveyance, devolution in
law, or otherwise, and, if and as far as the lessor has power to

to the permission actually given; or
(b)
to the specific breach of any provision or covenant
referred to; or
(c)
to any other matter specifically authorised to be done by
the licence;
and the licence does not prevent any proceeding for any
subsequent breach unless otherwise specified in the licence.
(2)
Despite any such licence—
(a)
all rights under covenants, obligations, and powers of
re-entry contained in the lease remain in full force and
are available as against any subsequent breach of
covenant, obligation, condition or other matter not
specifically authorised or waived, in the same manner as

the condition or right of entry remains in force in all
respects as if the licence had not been granted, save in

(b)
to any lessee, or to any 1 of 2 or more lessees to assign
or underlet part only of the property, or to do any act in
respect of part only of the property;
the licence does not operate to extinguish the right of entry in
case of any breach of covenant, obligation, or condition by the
co-lessees of the other shares or interests in the property, or by
the lessee or lessees of the rest of the property (as the case
may be), in respect of such shares or interests or remaining
property, but the right of entry remains in force in respect of
the shares, interests or property not the subject of the licence.

121
Provisions as to covenants not to assign etc. without 
licence or consent
(1)
In all leases whether made before or after the commencement
of this Act, containing a covenant, condition, or agreement
against assigning, underletting, charging or parting with the
possession of premises leased or any part of the premises,
without licence or consent, such covenant, condition, or
agreement shall—
(a)
despite any express provision to the contrary, be deemed
to be subject—
(i)
to a proviso to the effect that the licence or consent
is not to be unreasonably withheld, but this proviso
does not preclude the right of the lessor to require
payment of a reasonable sum in respect of any
legal or other expenses incurred in connection with
the licence or consent; and

consideration wholly or partially of the erection, or

or not) effected more than 7 years before the end of
the term no consent or licence shall be required, if
notice in writing of the transaction is given to the
lessor within 6 months after the transaction is
effected; and
(b)
unless the lease contains an express provision to the
contrary, be deemed to be subject to a proviso to the
effect that no fine or sum of money in the nature of a
fine shall be payable for or in respect of the licence or
consent, but this proviso does not preclude the right to
require the payment of a reasonable sum in respect of
any legal or other expenses incurred in relation to the
licence or consent.
(2)
In all leases, whether made before or after the commencement
of this Act, containing a covenant, condition, or agreement
against the making of improvements without licence or
consent, such covenant, condition, or agreement shall be
deemed, despite any express provision to the contrary, to be
subject to the proviso that the licence or consent is not to be
unreasonably withheld, but this proviso does not preclude the
right to require as a condition of the licence or consent the
payment of a reasonable sum in respect of any damage to or
diminution in the value of the premises or any neighbouring
premises belonging to the lessor, and of any legal or other
expenses properly incurred in connection with the licence or
consent nor in the case of an improvement which does not add
to the letting value of the holding, does it preclude the right to
require as a condition of the licence or consent, where such a
requirement would be reasonable, an undertaking on the part
of the lessee to reinstate the premises in the condition in
which they were before the improvement was executed.
(3)
In all leases, whether made before or after the commencement
of this Act, containing a covenant, condition, or agreement

that no fine or sum of money in the nature of a fine, whether
by way of increase of rent or otherwise, shall be payable for or

reasonable sum in respect of any damage to or diminution in
the value of the premises or any neighbouring premises
belonging to the lessor and of any legal or other expenses
incurred in connection with the licence or consent.

been determined by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
lessor shall be bound to grant the licence or consent on
payment of the sum so determined to be reasonable.

Involuntary assignment no breach of covenant
Neither the assignment nor the underletting of any lease by
the trustee of a bankrupt, or by the liquidator on behalf of a
company (other than a liquidator in a voluntary winding up of
a solvent company), nor the sale of any lease under an
execution, nor the bequest of a lease shall be deemed to be a

Restriction on and relief against forfeiture
(1)
A right of re-entry or forfeiture under any proviso or
stipulation in a lease, for a breach of any covenant, obligation,
condition or agreement (express or implied) in the lease, shall
not be enforceable by action or otherwise unless and until the
lessor serves on the lessee a notice—
(a)
specifying the particular breach complained of; and
(b)
if the breach is capable of remedy, requiring the lessee
to remedy the breach; and
(c)
in case the lessor claims compensation in money for the
breach, requiring the lessee to pay the same;
and the lessee fails within a reasonable time after service of
the notice to remedy the breach, if it is capable of remedy,
and, where compensation in money is required, to pay

reasonable compensation to the satisfaction of the lessor for
the breach.
(2)
Where a lessor is proceeding by action or otherwise to enforce
such a right of re-entry or forfeiture, or has re-entered without
action the lessee may, in the lessor’s action (if any) or in
proceedings instituted by the lessee, apply to the court for
relief, and the court, having regard to the proceedings and
conduct of the parties under subsection (1), and to all the other
circumstances, may grant or refuse relief, as it thinks fit, and
in case of relief may grant the same on such terms (if any) as
to costs, expenses, damages, compensation, penalty or
otherwise, including the granting of an injunction to restrain
any like breach in the future, as the court in the circumstances
of each case thinks fit.
(3)
The making of an application under this section shall not of
itself be construed as an admission on the part of the lessee—
(a)
that any such notice as is mentioned in subsection (1)
has been served by the lessor; or
(b)
that any such breach as is mentioned in subsection (1)
has occurred or that any right of or cause for re-entry or
forfeiture has accrued or arisen;
and the court may, if it thinks fit, grant relief without making a
finding that, or arriving at a final determination whether, any
such notice has been served, or any such breach has occurred,
or that any such right has accrued or cause arisen.
(4)
This section applies although the proviso or stipulation under
which the right of re-entry or forfeiture accrues is inserted in
the lease under the directions of any Act of Parliament.
(5)
For the purposes of this section a lease limited to continue as
long only as the lessee abstains from committing a breach of
covenant or obligation shall be and take effect as a lease to
continue for any longer term for which it could subsist, but
determinable by a proviso for re-entry on such a breach.

(1)
Where a lessor is proceeding, by action or otherwise, to
enforce a right of re-entry or forfeiture, under any covenant,
proviso, or stipulation in a lease made either before or after
the commencement of this Act or for non-payment of rent, the
court may, on application by any person claiming as
under-lessee any estate or interest in the property comprised
in the lease, or any part of any estate or interest in the
property, make an order staying any such action or other
proceeding on such terms as to the court may seem just, and
vesting, for the whole term of the lease, or any less term, the
property comprised in the lease or any part of any estate or
interest in the property, in any person entitled as under-lessee
to any estate or interest in such property, upon such conditions
as to execution of any deed or other document, payment of
proper and reasonable rent, costs, expenses, damages,
compensation, giving security, or otherwise as the court in the
circumstances of each case, and having regard to the consent
or otherwise of the lessor to the creation of the estate or
interest claimed by the under-lessee, thinks fit, but in no case
shall any such under-lessee be entitled to require a lease to be
granted to the under-lessee for a larger area of land or for any
longer term than the under-lessee had under the original
under-lease.
(2)
Any such order may be made in proceedings brought for the
purpose by the person claiming as under-lessee or, where the
lessor is proceeding by action or otherwise in the court, may
be made in such proceeding.

re-entry or forfeiture which, at the request of the lessee, is
waived by the lessor, or from which the lessee is relieved,

127
Relief against notice to effect decorative repairs
(1)
After a notice is served on a lessee relating to the internal
decorative repairs to a house or other building, the lessee may
apply to the court for relief, and if, having regard to all the
circumstances of the case (including in particular the length of
the lessee’s term or interest remaining unexpired), the court is
satisfied that the notice is unreasonable, it may, by order,
wholly or partially relieve the lessee from liability for such
repairs.

a reference to a breach by a lessee of the lessee’s
obligations under a lease containing an option is a

whom the notice is served from exercising an option
contained in the lease.
(4)
Where an act or omission that constituted a breach by a lessee
of the lessee’s obligations under a lease containing an option
would, but for this section, have had the effect of precluding
the lessee from exercising the option, the act or omission shall
be deemed not to have had that effect where the lessee
purports to exercise the option unless, during the period of 14
days next succeeding the purported exercise of the option, the
lessor serves on the lessee prescribed notice of the act or
omission and—
(a)

disposed of, in so far as they relate to that relief,
otherwise than by granting relief; or

by the summons to appear, gives written notice to the clerk of
the court at which the defendant is summoned to appear that

complainant may be admitted.
(4)
The summons shall be served within a reasonable time before
the time appointed for the defendant to appear and in the
manner provided by the Justices Act 1886.

belief and stating the sources of such information and grounds
of belief) to the court before which the defendant is required
by the summons to appear that for any cause the service of a
summons issued and complaint made under this division

make such order for substituted or other service as it
thinks proper, in which case the summons and complaint
served in the manner provided by such order shall be
deemed to have been duly served on the defendant; or
(b)
upon being satisfied that the summons and complaint
have by any means come to the knowledge of the

satisfied that there is such cause, to order that a warrant be
issued against the defendant requiring and authorising any
person to whom it is addressed to take and give possession of
the land the subject of the complaint to the landlord or, where

through the defendant together with the defendant’s or their
goods and effects, and to give possession of the same to the

person whose occupation is referable to a tenancy held of the
defendant (whether the tenancy was created before or after the

even though such tenancy has expired by effluxion of time,
has been determined by a notice to terminate, or has been
otherwise terminated.

Such further matter of complaint shall be set out in a separate
paragraph in the complaint.
(2)
In respect of such further matter of complaint the same
particulars of the complainant’s claim for rent or mesne
profits, or both, shall be supplied and served as would be
required if the claim were being made by way of a claim filed
in a Magistrates Court exercising jurisdiction under the
Magistrates Courts Act 1921.
(3)
In any case where the court orders that the further matter of
complaint be heard separately it may, by the same or any
subsequent order, give directions for the conduct of the
proceedings in relation to the complaint or may order that the
proceedings be carried on in the same manner as if the claim
were being made by way of a claim filed in a Magistrates
Court exercising jurisdiction under the Magistrates Courts Act
1921.
(4)
Where the matters of complaint are heard together, if, under
section 145(2), the matters prescribed by section 145(1) may
be proved by affidavit, the amount of indebtedness the subject
of the further matter of complaint may also be proved by
affidavit.

Rehearing where proof made by affidavit
(1)
Where, in default of appearance of the defendant at the time
and place appointed by the summons for the hearing and
determination of the complaint, or at any time or place to
which the hearing is adjourned, the court has, upon proof by
affidavit of the matters required by section 145(1) to be
proved, ordered that the warrant mentioned in that subsection
be issued, a Magistrates Court at the place where the order
was made may, upon application in that behalf made by the
defendant or by the defendant’s counsel or solicitor, within 7
days after the date on which the order was made, if in its
opinion there is a proper reason for so doing, grant a rehearing
of the complaint upon which the order was made on such
terms and subject to the payment of such costs as it thinks fit.
(2)
Upon and because of the grant of a rehearing—
(a)
subject to subsection (4), the order for the issue of a
warrant made upon the first hearing and any warrant
issued under it shall cease to have effect; and
(b)
the court may, with the consent of the complainant,
proceed with the rehearing immediately or it may and, if
the complainant does not consent to the court
proceeding with the rehearing immediately, shall set

redetermined as if the rehearing were the original
hearing and determination.

effect accordingly and shall be deemed to have had force and
effect on and from the date when the order was first made or,
in the case of such warrant, it was first issued.
(4A)
However, in the case of such a warrant the time limited for its
execution shall begin to run on and from the date of the order
restoring it to effect.
(5)
Where in the case of a complaint containing a further matter
of complaint under section 147, the matters of complaint have
been heard together, then upon and because of the grant of a
rehearing of the complaint the order (if any) made against the
defendant in respect of such further matter of complaint shall,
subject to subsection (6), cease to have effect and upon the
rehearing such further matter of complaint shall be reheard
and redetermined as if the rehearing were the original hearing
and determination of the original hearing.
(6)
If, under subsection (4), the court orders the original order for
the issue of a warrant made upon the complaint to be restored
the order (if any) made against the defendant in respect of the
further matter of complaint shall, without any order of the
court be also restored to effect.
(7)
However, the court, upon the application of the complainant
and upon proof, which may be by affidavit, of the amount
payable and unpaid at the date it restores the order for the
issue of a warrant made upon the original complaint, may vary
the order made in respect of the further matter of complaint so
as to require the payment of such amount.

Persons lacking right to possession not protected
(1)

requirement a reference may be had in manner provided by
this division.
(2A)
If the arbitrator is satisfied that any improvement specified in
the tenant’s notice will increase the value of the holding to an
incoming tenant and will be a suitable and desirable
improvement, the arbitrator shall make an award accordingly,
and the tenant shall be entitled to compensation for every
improvement which the tenant makes under such award.
(2B)
If the arbitrator is satisfied that such improvement will not
increase the value of the holding to an incoming tenant, and
will be an unsuitable and undesirable improvement, the tenant
shall not, if the tenant executes such improvement, be entitled
to any compensation in relation to the improvement.
(3)
If no agreement is entered into within 1 month after such
notice has been given, or if there is a reference to arbitration,
then, within 1 month after the award has been made the
landlord may, unless the notice of the tenant is previously
withdrawn, undertake to make the improvement, and may
make the same accordingly in any reasonable and proper
manner the landlord thinks fit, and may charge the tenant
interest at the rate of 5% per annum on the outlay incurred in
making the improvement.

Such interest shall be payable and recoverable as rent in the
same manner and at the same time as the rent in respect of the
holding is payable and recoverable.
(4)
In default of any such agreement or undertaking, and also in
the event of the landlord failing to comply with the landlord’s
undertaking within a reasonable time, the tenant may make
the improvement, and shall in that case be entitled to

Rules for ascertaining amount of compensation
In ascertaining the amount of compensation payable to the
tenant in respect of any improvements made by the tenant, the
arbitrator shall be guided by the following rules—
(a)
the amount to be awarded shall be such sum as fairly
represents the value of the improvements to an incoming
tenant;
(b)
there shall not be taken into account as part of such
improvements what is justly due to the inherent
capabilities of the soil;
(c)
there shall be taken into account by way of set off
against such improvements—
(i)
any benefit which the landlord has given or
allowed to the tenant in consideration of the tenant
making the improvements; and
(ii)
any sum due to the landlord from the tenant for
rent or otherwise; and
(iii) compensation to the landlord by way of damages
for any waste, or for any breach of covenant,
contract or agreement connected with the tenancy
committed or permitted by the tenant, but the
landlord shall not be entitled to have taken into
account any waste or breach by the tenant in
relation to a matter of husbandry or cultivation
committed or permitted more than 2 years before
the determination of the tenancy; and
(iv) any rates, taxes, or assessments due in respect of
the holding to which the tenant is liable as between
the tenant and the landlord.
162
Recovery of compensation
(1)
Where any money agreed to be paid for compensation, costs,
or otherwise is not paid within 14 days after the time when it
is agreed to be paid, it shall be recoverable upon an order
made by a judge of the District Court as money ordered to be

paid by the District Court in its ordinary jurisdiction is
recoverable.
(2)
Where any money awarded to be paid for compensation,
costs, or otherwise is not paid in accordance with such order, a
copy of such award may be filed in a District Court registry,
and on the order may then be enforced in all respects as if it
were judgment of the District Court for the amount due,
together with the costs of and incidental to enforcing the
award.
163
Landlord who is a trustee
(1)
Where the landlord is a person entitled to receive the rents and
profits of any holding as a trustee or otherwise than for the
landlord’s own benefit, the amount due from such landlord in
respect of compensation, costs, or otherwise shall not be
recoverable personally against the landlord, nor shall the
landlord be under any personal liability to pay such amount,
but the same shall be a charge on and recoverable against the
holding.
(1A)
If such landlord has not paid to the tenant the amount due to
the tenant within 14 days after the time when such amount
was agreed or awarded to be paid, then the tenant shall be
entitled to obtain from the court an order in favour of the

Compensation to tenants, when mortgagee in 
possession
(1)
Where a tenant holds land under a contract of tenancy with the
mortgagor, and such land is mortgaged at the time when such
contract was made, or is subsequently mortgaged, and the
mortgagee enters into possession of the holding, then the
tenant shall, as against such mortgagee in possession, be
entitled to any compensation which is or would be due to the
tenant from the mortgagor.
(2)
Before such mortgagee deprives the tenant of possession of
the holding otherwise than under such contract, the mortgagee
shall give to the tenant 6 months’ notice in writing of the
mortgagee’s intention so to deprive the tenant.
(3)
In ascertaining the amount of such compensation payable by
the mortgagee the arbitrator shall have regard to the same
rules as are hereinbefore provided for the ascertainment of
compensation payable by a landlord, with this addition, that
compensation shall be paid to the tenant for the tenant’s crops,
and for any expenditure upon the land which the tenant has
made in the expectation of holding the land for the full term of
the tenant’s contract of tenancy, in so far as any improvement
resulting therefrom is not exhausted at the time of the tenant
being deprived of possession.
(4)
Such compensation shall be determined and recovered in like
manner as compensation under this division, and for all such
purposes the expression landlord, wherever used in this
division, shall be deemed to include such mortgagee in
possession.
165
Incoming tenant’s claim for compensation reserved
Where an incoming tenant has, with the consent in writing of
the tenant’s landlord, paid to an outgoing tenant any
compensation in respect of the whole or part of any
improvement, such incoming tenant shall be entitled, on
quitting the holding, to obtain compensation in respect of such
improvement or part in like manner (if at all) as the outgoing
tenant would have been entitled if the tenant had remained

when the incoming tenant quits the same.
166
Change of tenancy not to affect right to compensation
A tenant who has remained on his or her holding during a
change or changes of tenancy shall not afterwards, on quitting
his or her holding at the determination of a tenancy, be
deprived of the tenant’s right to compensation in respect of
improvements merely because such improvements were made
by the tenant during a former tenancy or tenancies, and not
during the tenancy at the determination of which the tenant is
quitting.

Power of entry
The landlord of a holding, or any person authorised by the
landlord, may at all reasonable times enter on the holding, or
any part of it, for the purpose of viewing the state of the

No presumption of right to access or use of light or air
From and after 1 March 1907, no right to the access or use of
light or air to or for any building shall be deemed to exist, or
to be capable of coming into existence, merely because of the
enjoyment of such access or use for any period or of any
presumption of lost grant based upon such enjoyment.
179
Right to support of land and buildings
For the benefit of all interests in other land which may be
adversely affected by any breach of this section, there shall be
attached to any land an obligation not to do anything on or
below it that will withdraw support from any other land or
from any building, structure or erection that has been placed
on or below it.
180
Imposition of statutory rights of user in respect of land
(1)
Where it is reasonably necessary in the interests of effective
use in any reasonable manner of any land (the dominant land)
that such land, or the owner for the time being of such land,
should in respect of any other land (the servient land) have a
statutory right of user in respect of that other land, the court
may, on the application of the owner of the dominant land but
subject to this section, impose upon the servient land, or upon
the owner for the time being of such land, an obligation of
user or an obligation to permit such user in accordance with
that order.
(2)
A statutory right of user imposed under subsection (1) may
take the form of an easement, licence or otherwise, and may
be declared to be exercisable—
(a)
by such persons, their servants and agents, in such
number, and in such manner and subject to such
conditions; and

it is consistent with the public interest that the dominant
land should be used in the manner proposed; and
(b)
the owner of the servient land can be adequately
recompensed in money for any loss or disadvantage
which the owner may suffer from the imposition of the
obligation; and
(c)
either—
(i)
the owner of the servient land has refused to agree
to accept the imposition of such obligation and the
owner’s refusal is in all the circumstances
unreasonable; or
(ii)
no person can be found who possesses the
necessary capacity to agree to accept the
imposition of such obligation.
(4)
An order under this section (including an order under this
subsection)—
(a)
shall, except in special circumstances, include provision
for payment by the applicant to such person or persons
as may be specified in the order of such amount by way

that—
(i)
the statutory right of user, or some aspect of it, is
no longer reasonably necessary in the interests of
effective use of the dominant land; or
(ii)
some material change in the circumstances has
taken place since the order imposing the statutory
right of user was made; and

The court may—
(a)

order any person to execute any instrument or
instruments in registrable or other form necessary for
giving effect to an order made under this section; and

181
Power to modify or extinguish easements and restrictive 
covenants
(1)
Where land is subject to an easement or to a restriction arising
under covenant or otherwise as to the user of the land, the
court may from time to time, on the application of any person
interested in the land, by order modify or wholly or partially
extinguish the easement or restriction upon being satisfied—
(a)
that because of change in the user of any land having the
benefit of the easement or restriction, or in the character
of the neighbourhood or other circumstances of the case
which the court may deem material, the easement or
restriction ought to be deemed obsolete; or
(b)
that the continued existence of the easement or
restriction would impede some reasonable user of the
land subject to the easement or restriction, or that the
easement or restriction, in impeding that user, either—
(i)
does not secure to persons entitled to the benefit of
it any practical benefits of substantial value, utility,
or advantage to them; or
(ii)
is contrary to the public interest;
and that money will be an adequate compensation for
the loss or disadvantage (if any) which any such person
will suffer from the extinguishment or modification; or
(c)
that the persons of full age and capacity for the time
being or from time to time entitled to the easement or to
the benefit of the restriction, whether in respect of
estates in fee simple or any lesser estates or interests in

Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel
the land to which the easement or the benefit of the
restriction is annexed, have agreed to the easement or
restriction being modified or wholly or partially
extinguished, or by their acts or omissions may
reasonably be considered to have abandoned the
easement wholly or in part or waived the benefit of the
restriction wholly or in part; or
(d)
that the proposed modification or extinguishment will
not substantially injure the persons entitled to the
easement, or to the benefit of the restriction.
(2)
In determining whether a case is one falling within
subsection (1)(a) or (b), and in determining whether (in such
case or otherwise) an easement or restriction ought to be
extinguished or modified, the court shall take into account the
town plan and any declared or ascertainable pattern of the
local government for the grant or refusal of consent,
permission or approval to use any land or to erect or use any
building or other structure in the relevant area, as well as the
period at which and context in which the easement or
restriction was created or imposed, and any other material
circumstance.
(3)
The power conferred by subsection (1) to extinguish or
modify an easement or restriction includes a power to add
such further provisions restricting the user or the building on
the land as appear to the court to be reasonable in view of the
relaxation of the existing provisions, and as may be accepted
by the applicant, and the court may accordingly refuse to
modify an easement or restriction without such addition.
(4)
An order extinguishing or modifying an easement or
restriction under subsection (1) may direct the applicant to
pay to any person entitled to the benefit of the easement or
restriction such sum by way of consideration as the court may
think it just to award under one, but not both, of the following
heads, that is to say, either—
(a)
a sum to make up for any loss or disadvantage suffered
by that person in consequence of the extinguishment or
modification; or

(b)
a sum to make up for any effect which the restriction
had, at the time when it was imposed, in reducing the
consideration then received for the land affected by it.
(5)
Where any proceedings by action or otherwise are instituted
to enforce an easement or restriction, or to enforce any rights
arising out of a breach of any restriction, any person against
whom the proceedings are instituted may in such proceedings
apply to the court for an order under this section, and such
application shall, unless the court otherwise orders, operate to
stay such proceedings until determination of the application
made under this section.
(6)
The court may in any proceedings under this section on the
application of any person interested make an order declaring
whether or not in any particular case any land is or would in
any given event be affected by an easement or restriction, and
the nature and extent of it, and whether the same is or would
in any given event be enforceable, and if so by whom.
(7)
Notice of any application made under this section shall, if the
court so directs, be given to the local government in whose
area the land is situated, and to such other persons and in such
manner, whether by advertisement or otherwise, as the court,
either generally or in a particular instance, may order.
(8)
An order under this section shall, when registered, entered or
endorsed, be binding on all persons, whether of full age or
capacity or not, then entitled or afterwards becoming entitled
to the easement, or interested in enforcing the restriction and
whether such persons are parties to the proceedings or have
been served with notice or not.

The court may—

all legal and other remedies for the same; and

This part applies to powers created or arising either before or
after the commencement of this Act.
202
Mode of exercise of powers
(1)
Where a power of appointment by an instrument other than a
will is exercised by deed, executed and attested under this Act,
or, in the case of an instrument under the Land Title Act 1994,
under that Act, such deed or instrument shall, so far as
respects the execution and attestation of the instrument, be a
valid exercise of the power, even though by the instrument
creating the power some additional or other form of execution
or attestation or solemnity is required.
(2)
This section does not operate to defeat any direction in the
instrument creating the power that—
(a)
the consent of any particular person is to be necessary to
a valid execution; or
(b)
in order to give validity to any appointment, any act is to
be performed having no relation to the mode of
executing and attesting the instrument.
(3)
This section does not prevent the donee of a power from
executing it under the power by writing, or otherwise than by
an instrument executed and attested as a deed, and where a
power is so executed this section does not apply.

203
Validation of appointments where objects are excluded or 
take illusory shares
(1)
No appointment made in exercise of any power to appoint any
property among 2 or more objects shall be invalid on the
ground that—
(a)
an unsubstantial, illusory, or nominal share only is
appointed to or left unappointed to devolve upon any 1
or more of the objects of the power; or
(b)
any object of the power is altogether excluded;
but every such appointment shall be valid even though any 1
or more of the objects is not, or in default of appointment, to
take any share in the property.
(2)
This section does not affect any provision in the instrument
creating the power which declares the amount of any share
from which any object of the power is not to be excluded.
(3)
This section applies to appointments made before or after the
commencement of this Act.
204
Protection of purchasers claiming under certain void 
appointments
(1)
An instrument purporting to exercise a power of appointment
over property, which, in default of and subject to any
appointment, is held in trust for a class or number of persons
of whom the appointee is one, shall not be void on the ground
of fraud on the power as against a purchaser in good faith.
(1A)
However, if the interest appointed exceeds, in amount or
value, the interest in such property to which immediately
before the execution of the instrument the appointee was
presumptively entitled under the trust in default of
appointment, having regard to any advances made in the
appointee’s favour and to any hotchpot provision, the
protection afforded by this section to a purchaser shall not
extend to such excess.
(2)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[s 205]

reasonable inquiries had been made, the fraud might have
been discovered.
(3)
Persons deriving title under any purchaser entitled to the
benefit of this section shall be entitled to the like benefit.
(4)
This section applies only to dealings effected after the
commencement of this Act.
205
Disclaimer etc. of powers

A person to whom any power, whether or not coupled with an
interest, is given, may by deed disclaim, release or contract
not to exercise the power, and after such disclaimer release or
contract shall not be capable of exercising or joining in the
exercise of the power.
(2)
On such disclaimer, release, or contract, the power may be
exercised by the other person or persons or the survivor or
survivors of the other persons to whom the power is given
unless the contrary is expressed in the instrument creating the
power.
(3)

may or is required to be registered under any Act, the power
may be released or disclaimed by a memorandum in the
approved form which may be registered.

(a)
does not apply to a power coupled with a duty; and

Definitions for pt 14
In this part—
disposition includes the conferring or exercise of a power of
appointment or any other power or authority to dispose of an
interest in or a right over property and any other disposition of
an interest in or right over property.
instrument includes a will, and also includes an instrument,
testamentary or otherwise, exercising a power of appointment
whether general or special but does not include an Act.
power of appointment includes any discretionary power to
transfer or grant or create a beneficial interest in property
without the furnishing of valuable consideration.
206A
When disposition in will made
For the purposes of this part a disposition contained in a will
shall be deemed to be made at the death of the testator.
206B
When person to be treated as member of class
For the purposes of this part a person shall be treated as a
member of a class if in the person’s case all the conditions
identifying a member of the class are satisfied, and shall be
treated as a potential member if in the person’s case only 1 or
some of those conditions are satisfied but there is a possibility
that the remainder will in time be satisfied.
207
Application of pt 14
(1)
Save as otherwise provided in this part, this part shall apply
only in relation to instruments taking effect after the
commencement of this Act, and in the case of an instrument
under which a special power of appointment is exercised shall

[s 208]

apply only where the instrument creating the power takes
effect after that commencement.
(1A)
However, section 208 shall apply in all cases for construing
the reference in this subsection to a special power of
appointment.
(2)
This part applies in relation to a disposition made otherwise
than by an instrument as if the disposition had been contained
in an instrument taking effect when the disposition was made.
208
Powers of appointment
(1)
For the purposes of the rule against perpetuities a power of
appointment shall be treated as a special power unless—
(a)
in the instrument creating the power it is expressed to be
exercisable by 1 person only; and
(b)
it could at all times during its currency when that person
is of full age and capacity be exercised by the person so
as immediately to transfer to or otherwise vest in the
person the whole of the interest governed by the power
without the consent of any other person or compliance
with any other condition, not being a formal condition
relating only to the mode of exercise of the power.
(2)
However, for the purpose of determining whether a
disposition made under a power of appointment exercisable
by will only is void for remoteness the power shall be treated
as a general power where it would have fallen to be so treated
if exercisable by deed.
209
Power to specify perpetuity period
(1)
Except as otherwise provided in this part where the instrument
by which any disposition is made so provides the perpetuity
period applicable to the disposition under the rule against
perpetuities instead of being of any other duration shall be
such number of years not exceeding 80 as is specified in the
instrument as the perpetuity period applicable to the
disposition.

[s 210]
Property Law Act 1974
Part 14 Perpetuities and accumulations
Current as at 30 April 2022

Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel
(2)
Subsection (1) shall not have effect where the disposition is
made in exercise of a special power of appointment but where
a period is specified under that subsection in the instrument
creating such a power the period shall apply in relation to any
disposition under the power as it applies in relation to the
power itself.
(3)
If no period of years is specified in an instrument by which a
disposition is made as the perpetuity period applicable to the
disposition but a date certain is specified in the instrument as
the date on which the disposition shall vest the instrument
shall, for the purposes of this section, be deemed to specify as
the perpetuity period applicable to the disposition a number of
years equal to the number of years from the date of the taking
effect of the instrument to the specified vesting date.
210
Wait and see rule
(1)
Where apart from the provisions of this section and of
section 213 a disposition would be void on the ground that the
interest disposed of might not become vested until too remote
a time the disposition shall be treated until such time (if any)
as it becomes established that the vesting must occur, if at all,
after the end of the perpetuity period as if the disposition were
not subject to the rule against perpetuities, and its becoming
so established shall not affect the validity of anything
previously done in relation to the interest disposed of by way
of advancement, application of intermediate income or
otherwise.
(2)
Where apart from the provisions of this section and of
section 213 a disposition consisting of the conferring of a
general power of appointment would be void on the ground
that the power might not become exercisable until too remote
a time the disposition shall be treated until such time (if any)
as it becomes established that the power will not be
exercisable within the perpetuity period as if the disposition
were not subject to the rule against perpetuities.
(3)
Where apart from the provisions of this section and of
section 213 a disposition consisting of the conferring of any

[s 211]
Property Law Act 1974
Part 14 Perpetuities and accumulations
Page 182

Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel
power, option or other right would be void on the ground that
the right might be exercised at too remote a time the
disposition shall be treated as regards any exercise of the right
within the perpetuity period as if it were not subject to the rule
against perpetuities and subject to the provisions shall be
treated as void for remoteness only if and so far as the right is
not fully exercised within that period.
(4)
Nothing in this section makes any person a life in being for
the purposes of ascertaining the perpetuity period unless the
life of that person is one expressed or implied as relevant for
this purpose by the terms of the disposition and would have
been reckoned a life in being for such purpose if this section
had not been enacted.
(5)
However, in the case of a disposition to a class of persons or to
1 or more members of a class, any person living at the date of
the disposition whose life is so expressed or implied as
relevant for any member of the class may be reckoned a life in
being in ascertaining the perpetuity period.
211
Power to apply to court for declaration as to validity
(1)
A trustee of any property, or any person interested under, or
on the invalidity of, a disposition of property, may at any time
apply to the court for a declaration as to the validity, in respect
to the rule against perpetuities, of a disposition of that
property.
(2)
The court may, on an application under subsection (1), make a
declaration, on the basis of facts existing and events that have
occurred at the time the declaration is made, as to the validity
or otherwise of the disposition in respect of which the
application is made, but the court shall not make a declaration
in respect of any disposition the validity of which cannot be
determined at the time at which the court is asked to make the
declaration.

Presumptions and evidence as to future parenthood
(1)
Where in any proceedings there arises on the rule against
perpetuities a question which turns on the capacity of a person
to have a child at some future time, then—
(a)
it shall be presumed, subject to paragraph (b), that a
male can have a child at the age of 12 years or over but
not under that age and that a female can have a child at
the age of 12 years or over but not under that age or over
the age of 55 years; but
(b)
in the case of a living person evidence may be given to
show that he or she will or will not be capable of having
a child at the time in question.
(2)
Where any such question is decided by treating a person as
incapable of having a child at a particular time and he or she
does so, the court may make such order as it thinks fit for
placing the persons interested in the property comprised in the
disposition so far as may be just in the position they would
have held if the question had not been so decided.
(3)
Subject to subsection (2), where any such question is decided
in relation to a disposition by treating a person as capable or
incapable of having a child at a particular time then he or she
shall be so treated for the purpose of any question which may
arise on the rule against perpetuities in relation to the same
disposition in any subsequent proceedings.
(4)
In this section, references to having a child are references to
begetting or giving birth to a child, but this section (other than
subsection (1)(b)) shall apply in relation to the possibility that
a person will at any time have a child by adoption,
legitimation or other means as they apply to the person’s
capacity at that time to beget or give birth to a child.
213
Reduction of age and exclusion of class members to 
avoid remoteness
(1)
Where a disposition is limited by reference to the attainment
by any person or persons of a specified age exceeding 18

years and it is apparent at the time the disposition is made or
becomes apparent at a subsequent time—
(a)
that the disposition would apart from this section be
void for remoteness; but
(b)
that it would not be so void if the specified age had been
18 years;
the disposition shall be treated for all purposes as if instead of
being limited by reference to the age in fact specified it had
been limited by reference to the age nearest to that age which
would if specified instead, have prevented the disposition
from being so void.
(2)
Where in the case of any disposition different ages exceeding
18 years are specified in relation to different persons—
(a)
the reference in subsection (1)(b) to the specified age
shall be construed as a reference to all the specified
ages; and
(b)
that subsection shall operate to reduce each such age so
far as is necessary to save the disposition from being
void for remoteness.
(3)
Where the inclusion of any persons being potential members
of a class or unborn persons who at birth would become
members or potential members of the class prevents
subsections (1) and (2) from operating to save a disposition
from being void for remoteness, those persons shall be
deemed for all the purposes of the disposition to be excluded
from the class and subsections (1) and (2) shall have effect
accordingly.
(4)
Where in the case of a disposition to which subsection (3)
does not apply it is apparent at the time the disposition is
made or becomes apparent at a subsequent time that apart
from this subsection the inclusion of any persons, being
potential members of a class or unborn persons who at birth
could become members or potential members of the class
would cause the disposition to be treated as void for
remoteness, those persons shall unless their exclusion would

exhaust the class be deemed for all the purposes of the
disposition to be excluded from the class.
(5)
Where this section has effect in relation to a disposition to
which section 210 applies the operation of this section shall
not affect the validity of anything previously done in relation
to the interest disposed of by way of advancement, application
of intermediate income or otherwise.
214
Unborn husband or wife
The widow or widower of a person who is a life in being for
the purposes of the rule against perpetuities shall be deemed
to be a life in being for the purpose of—
(a)
a disposition in favour of that widow or widower; and
(b)
a disposition in favour of a charity which attains or of a
person who attains or of a class the members of which
attain under the terms of the disposition a vested interest
on or after the death of the survivor of the person who is
a life in being and that widow or widower, or on or after
the death of that widow or widower or on or after the
happening of any contingency during her or his lifetime.
215
Dependent dispositions
A disposition shall not be treated as void for remoteness
merely because the interest disposed of is ulterior to and
dependent upon an interest under a disposition which is so
void, and the vesting of an interest shall not be prevented from
being accelerated on the failure of a prior interest merely
because the failure arises because of remoteness.
216
Abolition of the rule against double possibilities
(1)
The rule of law prohibiting the limitation, after a life interest
to an unborn person, of an interest in land to the unborn child
or other issue of an unborn person is abolished.

of a determinable fee simple, in which case if the fee
simple does not determine within the perpetuity period
it shall afterwards continue as a fee simple absolute; and
(b)
to a possibility of a resulting trust on the determination
of any other determinable interest in property, in which
case if the first interest created by the trust does not
determine within the perpetuity period the interest it
creates shall afterwards continue as an absolute interest;
and
(c)
to a right of entry for condition broken the exercise of
which may determine a fee simple subject to a condition
subsequent and to an equivalent right in the case of

diligence—the registrar may give written notice to the
applicant requiring the applicant to take such action in
regard to the application as the registrar may require in a
time to be stated in the notice and if the applicant in the
opinion of the registrar does not afterwards take such
action within such time or such further time as the
registrar may allow, the master of titles shall reject and
the registrar shall refuse such application;
(d)

given under paragraph (c) and until the registrar has
allowed or refused the application—the registrar may
from time to time give further such notices requiring

refused an application, the applicant may, even though the

Property Act 1861, section 27 and the court may in such case
make such order or orders in respect of the application as shall
seem just and equitable.

other dealing (whether under any statutory power or

Claims by persons claiming to be entitled to land or 
registrable interests
(1)
In respect of any land which has become vested in the public
trustee under section 250, a person claiming that but for
section 250 the person would have been entitled after
application to the registrar to have such land brought under the
Real Property Acts and to have a certificate of title issued in
respect of the land may make application to the registrar in the
same manner in so far as is applicable to the circumstances of
the case for the issue of a new certificate of title in respect of
such land in such form and to such person as but for
section 250 the person would have been entitled to have
issued and on the making of the application the Real Property
Acts shall apply to such application, as if it were an
application to bring unregistered land under those Acts, with
any necessary modification to meet the circumstances of the
case.
(2)
If upon such application the master of titles would have been
satisfied as to the claim of the applicant and the registrar
would have brought such land under the Real Property Acts if
such land was unregistered land which had not become vested
in the public trustee, the registrar shall issue a new certificate
of title to the land in the same manner as provided by the Real
Property Acts in that case and shall cancel the certificate of
title issued to the public trustee under section 250.
(2A)
However, before the issue of any new certificate of title under
this section the applicant shall pay to the land registry such
sum as the registrar shall determine as representing the costs
reasonably attributable to such land incurred by the registrar

(3)
Despite the proviso to the Real Property Act 1861, section 16,
any person who claims to be entitled to an estate or interest in
fee simple in any land which has vested in the public trustee
under section 250 and who would have been a person entitled
to make application to have the person’s estate or interest in
the land brought under the Real Property Acts except for the
proviso, may make an application to the registrar to have that
estate or interest divested from the public trustee and vested in
the person and the application shall be dealt with in the same
manner as an application under subsection (1).
(4)
In respect of any land which has become vested in the public
trustee under section 250, a person claiming that the person
would have been entitled to make application within the
specific time under section 250(5) to have any registrable
interests in respect of the land noted may make application to
the registrar in the same manner in so far as is applicable to
the circumstances of the case to have such interests noted on
the certificate of title for the land and on the making of the
application the provisions of the Real Property Acts shall
apply to such application, as if it were an application to bring
unregistered land under those Acts, with any necessary
modification to meet the circumstances of the case.

respect of such land may within a further period of 5 years
after such vesting in the Crown apply to the court for an order
that the registrar take such action as the registrar might have
on an application under section 251.
(3)
On any such application the court may with the consent of the
Crown grant such application if it considers it just and
equitable to do so and on such terms and conditions if any as it
thinks reasonable and any order made by the court under this
section shall so far as necessary have the effect of a grant of
that land to the person in whose favour the order is made.
(4)
If the Crown shall not consent to such application the court, if
it thinks it just and equitable to do so, may order the payment
out of the assurance fund constituted under the Real Property
Act 1861, sections 42 and 43 to the applicant or any other
person of such sum or sums of money as it thinks reasonable
not exceeding in all the value of the land or of the interest of
the applicant at the date of the vesting in the Crown.
Note—
Now see the Land Title Act 1994, section 207.
(5)
In exercising its jurisdiction under subsections (3) and (4), the
court shall have regard to all the circumstances including
whether there is reasonable excuse for any delay and for
failure of the applicant or any other person to proceed under
sections 250 and 251.
(6)
Whether or not any application has been made to the court
under this section the Governor in Council may by order in
council waive the right of the Crown in regard to the land or
any part of the land on such terms (if any) whether for the
payment of money or otherwise as to the Governor in Council
seems reasonable in favour of any person having in the
opinion of the Governor in Council a just claim in regard to
the land or such part of the land and on the making of the
order in council such land or such part shall vest in such
person and on such trusts (if any) as may be specified in the
order in council and a waiver under this subsection shall have
the effect of a grant of such land or such part to that person in
favour of whom the waiver is made.

255A
Relationship of this part with the Family Law Act in 
relation to particular financial matters
(1)
The State, by the Commonwealth Powers (De Facto
Relationships) Act 2003, referred the following matters (to the
extent that they are not otherwise included in the legislative
powers of the Parliament of the Commonwealth) to the
Parliament of the Commonwealth—
(a)
financial matters relating to de facto partners arising out
of the breakdown (other than by reason of death) of de
facto relationships between persons of different sexes;
(b)
financial matters relating to de facto partners arising out
of the breakdown (other than by reason of death) of de
facto relationships between persons of the same sex.
(2)
Consequently, this part does not apply in relation to financial
matters relating to de facto partners arising out of the
breakdown of their de facto relationship if the Commonwealth
Act applies in relation to the matters.
Note—
In most cases de facto partners seeking resolution of financial matters
arising out of the breakdown of their relationship should now proceed
under the Commonwealth Act.
(3)
However, this part continues to apply in relation to financial
matters relating to de facto partners if the Commonwealth Act
does not apply.
Examples—
1
The Commonwealth Act, section 90SK provides that particular
requirements must be satisfied before a court may make a
declaration under section 90SL of that Act. If, in the particular
circumstances of a case, those requirements are not satisfied, this
part may apply.
2
This part applies to de facto relationships that break down after 21
December 1999 and before the commencement of the Family Law
Amendment (De Facto Financial Matters and Other Measures) Act
2008 (Cwlth) (the Commonwealth amending Act) on 1 March
2009. However, section 86A of the Commonwealth amending Act
provides that de facto partners whose relationship broke down
before the commencement of that amending Act may choose to
agree to the application of particular provisions of the

circumstances.
256
How main purposes are to be achieved
The way in which these purposes are to be achieved
includes—
(a)
providing in division 3 for the resolution of financial
matters by de facto partners; and
(b)
providing in division 4 for the resolution of financial
matters by courts; and
(c)
providing in division 5 for declaratory relief about the
existence or non-existence of de facto relationships; and
(d)
providing in division 6 for the jurisdiction and powers of
the Supreme Court, the District Court and Magistrates
Courts to deal with matters under this part.
257
Application of pt 19
(1)
This part applies to all de facto relationships other than
relationships that ended before the commencement of this
section.
(2)
It does not matter whether a de facto relationship started
before or after the commencement of this section.
(3)
Despite subsection (1), this part does not apply in relation to a
de facto relationship to the extent the Commonwealth Act
applies in relation to the relationship.
(4)
Also if, in relation to a de facto relationship—
(a)
a de facto partner in the relationship makes an
application about a matter to a court having jurisdiction
under this part (the State proceeding); and
(b)
the other de facto partner in the relationship makes an
application about the same matter or a related matter to
a court having jurisdiction under the Commonwealth
Act (the Commonwealth proceeding); and

Example—
A de facto couple own and live on a farm. They have twins, a boy and a
girl. The twins always lived on the farm. After the twins left school, the
parents bought 2 additional farms. The son then worked on the farms
for no wages assuming, in time, 1 of the farms would be his. The
daughter looked after the family’s home for no wages assuming, in
time, 1 of the farms would be hers. In both cases, the children did much
more than the household chores (such as mowing the lawn and doing
the dishes) that a family might normally expect of family members.
When the children were 31 years, the parents separated.
The son’s contributions are substantial and would be considered under
section 291. The daughter’s contributions are also substantial and
would be considered under this section.

partner or a child of the de facto partners made under a law of
the Commonwealth or a State concerning de facto
relationships the court considers should be taken into account.

change in the financial circumstances of either of the de facto
partners, the matters a court may consider include any change
in the financial circumstances of the de facto partner that may

time, to become entitled to property that may be applied in
satisfaction of a property adjustment order, the court may

of an event, stated in the order.
315
Effect on proceeding of death of party

it is still appropriate to adjust the interests despite the
death of the deceased party.
