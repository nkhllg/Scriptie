If a subdivision is specified as exempt development in an applicable environmental planning
instrument, such as this Chapter or State Environmental Planning Policy (Exempt and Complying
Development Codes) 2008, the Act enables it to be carried out without development consent.
2
Part 6 of State Environmental Planning Policy (Exempt and Complying Development Codes) 2008
provides that the strata subdivision of a building in certain circumstances is complying development.
(2) Development consent must not be granted for the subdivision of land on which a
secondary dwelling is situated if the subdivision would result in the principal dwelling
and the secondary dwelling being situated on separate lots, unless the resulting lots
are not less than the minimum size shown on the Lot Size Map in relation to that land.

(f) to facilitate design excellence by ensuring the extent of floor space in building
envelopes leaves generous space for the articulation and modulation of design,
(g) to ensure that the floor space ratio of buildings on land in Zone R1 General
Residential reflects Council’s desired building envelope,
(h) to encourage lot amalgamation and new development forms in Zone R1 General
Residential with car parking below ground level.
(2) The maximum floor space ratio for a building on any land is not to exceed the floor
space ratio shown for the land on the Floor Space Ratio Map.
Note.
Sections 5.28, 5.46 and 5.55 provide exceptions to the maximum floor space ratio shown for the relevant
land on the Floor Space Ratio Map in certain circumstances.
5.27
Calculation of floor space ratio and site area
(1) Objectives The objectives of this section are as follows—
(a) to define floor space ratio,
(b) to set out rules for the calculation of the site area of development for the purpose
of applying permitted floor space ratios, including rules to—
(i) prevent the inclusion in the site area of an area that has no significant
development being carried out on it, and
(ii) prevent the inclusion in the site area of an area that has already been included
as part of a site area to maximise floor space area in another building, and
(iii) require community land and public places to be dealt with separately.
(2) Definition of “floor space ratio” The floor space ratio of buildings on a site is the ratio
of the gross floor area of all buildings within the site to the site area.
(3) Site area In determining the site area of proposed development for the purpose of
applying a floor space ratio, the site area is taken to be—
(a) if the proposed development is to be carried out on only one lot, the area of that
lot, or
(b) if the proposed development is to be carried out on 2 or more lots, the area of any
lot on which the development is proposed to be carried out that has at least one
common boundary with another lot on which the development is being carried out.
In addition, subsections (4)–(7) apply to the calculation of site area for the purposes of
applying a floor space ratio to proposed development.
(4) Exclusions from site area The following land must be excluded from the site area—
State Environmental Planning Policy (Precincts—Regional) 2021 [NSW]
Current version for 24 January 2025 to date (accessed 8 April 2025 at 19:25)
Page 73 of 274

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) land on which the proposed development is prohibited, whether under this
Chapter or any other law,
(b) community land or a public place (except as provided by subsection (7)).
(5) Strata subdivisions The area of a lot that is wholly or partly on top of another or others
in a strata subdivision is to be included in the calculation of the site area only to the
extent that it does not overlap with another lot already included in the site area
calculation.
(6) Only significant development to be included The site area for proposed development
must not include a lot additional to a lot or lots on which the development is being
carried out unless the proposed development includes significant development on that
additional lot.
(7) Certain public land to be separately considered For the purpose of applying a floor space
ratio to any proposed development on, above or below community land or a public
place, the site area must only include an area that is on, above or below that
community land or public place, and is occupied or physically affected by the
proposed development, and may not include any other area on which the proposed
development is to be carried out.
(8) Existing buildings The gross floor area of any existing or proposed buildings within the
vertical projection (above or below ground) of the boundaries of a site is to be
included in the calculation of the total floor space for the purposes of applying a floor
space ratio, whether or not the proposed development relates to all of the buildings.
(9) Covenants to prevent “double dipping” When development consent is granted to
development on a site comprised of 2 or more lots, a condition of the consent may
require a covenant to be registered that prevents the creation of floor area on a lot
(the restricted lot) if the consent authority is satisfied that an equivalent quantity of
floor area will be created on another lot only because the site included the restricted
lot.
(10) Covenants affect consolidated sites If—
(a) a covenant of the kind referred to in subsection (9) applies to any land (affected
land), and
(b) proposed development relates to the affected land and other land that together
comprise the site of the proposed development,
the maximum amount of floor area allowed on the other land by the floor space ratio
fixed for the site by this Chapter is reduced by the quantity of floor space area the
covenant prevents being created on the affected land.

Exceptions to development standards
(1) The objectives of this section are as follows—
(a) to provide an appropriate degree of flexibility in applying certain development
standards to particular development,
(b) to achieve better outcomes for and from development by allowing flexibility in
particular circumstances.
(2) Development consent may, subject to this section, be granted for development even
though the development would contravene a development standard imposed by this
or any other environmental planning instrument. However, this section does not apply
to a development standard that is expressly excluded from the operation of this
section.
(3) Development consent must not be granted to development that contravenes a
development standard unless the consent authority is satisfied the applicant for
development consent has demonstrated that—
(a) compliance with the development standard is unreasonable or unnecessary in the
circumstances, and
(b) there are sufficient environmental planning grounds to justify the contravention of
the development standard.
Note—
The Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulation 2021 requires the development application to be
accompanied by a document setting out the grounds on which the applicant seeks to demonstrate the
matters in paragraphs (a) and (b).
(4) The consent authority must keep a record of its assessment carried out under
subsection (3).
(5)
(Repealed)
(6) Development consent must not be granted under this section for a subdivision of land
in Zone RU1 Primary Production, Zone RU2 Rural Landscape, Zone RU3 Forestry, Zone
RU4 Primary Production Small Lots, Zone RU6 Transition, Zone R5 Large Lot
Residential, Zone E2 Environmental Conservation, Zone E3 Environmental
Management or Zone E4 Environmental Living if—
(a) the subdivision will result in 2 or more lots of less than the minimum area
specified for such lots by a development standard, or
(b) the subdivision will result in at least one lot that is less than 90% of the minimum

acquisition provisions may, before it is used for the purpose for which it is reserved, be
carried out, with development consent, for any purpose.
Note.
If land, other than land specified in the Table to subsection (2), is required to be acquired under the owner-
initiated acquisition provisions, the Minister for Planning and Infrastructure is required to take action to enable
the designation of the acquiring authority under this section. Pending the designation of the acquiring authority
for the land, the acquiring authority is to be the authority determined by order of the Minister for Planning and
Infrastructure (see section 21 of the Land Acquisition (Just Terms Compensation) Act 1991).

Classification and reclassification of public land
(1) The objective of this section is to enable the Council to classify or reclassify public
land as “operational land” or “community land” in accordance with Part 2 of Chapter 6
of the Local Government Act 1993.
Note.
Under the Local Government Act 1993, “public land” is generally land vested in or under the control of a
council (other than roads, Crown reserves and commons). The classification or reclassification of public land
may also be made by a resolution of the Council under section 31, 32 or 33 of the Local Government Act
1993. Section 30 of that Act enables this Chapter to discharge trusts on which public reserves are held if the
land is reclassified under this Chapter as operational land.
(2) The public land described in Part 1 or Part 2 of Schedule 8 is classified, or reclassified,
as operational land for the purposes of the Local Government Act 1993.
(3) The public land described in Part 3 of Schedule 8 is classified, or reclassified, as
community land for the purposes of the Local Government Act 1993.
(4) The public land described in Part 1 of Schedule 8—
(a) does not cease to be a public reserve to the extent (if any) that it is a public
reserve, and
(b) continues to be affected by any trusts, estates, interests, dedications, conditions,
restrictions or covenants that affected the land before its classification, or
reclassification, as operational land.
(5) The public land described in Part 2 of Schedule 8, to the extent (if any) that it is a

public reserve, ceases to be a public reserve when the description of the land is
inserted into that Part and is discharged from all trusts, estates, interests, dedications,
conditions, restrictions and covenants affecting the land or any part of the land,
except—
(a) those (if any) specified for the land in Column 3 of Part 2 of Schedule 8, and
(b) any reservations that except land out of the Crown grant relating to the land, and
(c) reservations of minerals (within the meaning of the Crown Land Management Act
2016).
Note.
In accordance with section 30(2) of the Local Government Act 1993, the approval of the Governor to
subsection (5) applying to the public land concerned is required before the description of the land is
inserted in Part 2 of Schedule 8.
5.31
Development near zone boundaries
(1) The objective of this section is to provide flexibility where the investigation of a site
and its surroundings reveals that a use allowed on the other side of a zone boundary
would enable a more logical and appropriate development of the site and be

(2) This section applies to so much of any land that is within the relevant distance of a
boundary between any 2 zones. The relevant distance is 10 metres.
(3) This section does not apply to—
(a) land in Zone RE1 Public Recreation, or
(a1) land in Zone B3 Commercial Core or Zone W2 Recreational Waterways, or
(b) land within the coastal zone, or
(c) land proposed to be developed for the purpose of sex services or restricted
premises.
(4) Despite the provisions of this Chapter relating to the purposes for which development
may be carried out, development consent may be granted to development of land to
which this section applies for any purpose that may be carried out in the adjoining
zone, but only if the consent authority is satisfied that—
(a) the development is not inconsistent with the objectives for development in both
zones, and
(b) the carrying out of the development is desirable due to compatible land use
planning, infrastructure capacity and other planning principles relating to the
efficient and timely development of land.
