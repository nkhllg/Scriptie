against the resolution.
(2) In this Act, a resolution of an association is a unanimous resolution if it is passed at
a properly convened general meeting and no vote is cast against the resolution.
(3) For the purposes of determining the value of a vote for a special resolution or a poll
of a community association—
(a) the value of the vote of a subsidiary body is equal to the unit entitlement of the
former community development lot that was subdivided to constitute the
subsidiary body, and

unit entitlement of the community development lot.
(4) For the purposes of determining the value of a vote for a special resolution or a poll
of a precinct association—
(a) the value of the vote of a subsidiary body is equal to the unit entitlement of the
former precinct development lot that was subdivided to constitute the subsidiary
body, and

of a neighbourhood association, the value of the vote of the owner of a neighbourhood

(6) However, if the total unit entitlement of lots for which the original owner is entitled to
a vote is not less than half of the total unit entitlement for the association, the value
of the vote in respect of those lots is taken to be reduced by two-thirds, ignoring any

Decisions at meetings—counting votes

according to a majority in number of the votes cast for and against the motion, unless
this Act requires it be determined by a poll, a special resolution or a unanimous
resolution.

have 1 vote for each relevant lot even if this results in the same person having more
than 1 vote on the motion.

way as for a special resolution.
