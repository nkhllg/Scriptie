record in that folio a caution warning persons dealing with the registered proprietor
that the land comprised therein is held subject to any subsisting interest, whether
recorded therein or not.
(1A) Where, in the opinion of the Registrar-General, any of the documents which
evidenced the title to land comprised in a qualified folio of the Register conveyed or
purported to convey the land otherwise than for valuable consideration, the Registrar-
General may, when creating the folio, include in the caution recorded therein a
notation to that effect.
(1B) Where, in the opinion of the Registrar-General, the title of the registered proprietor
to land comprised in a qualified folio of the Register depends on the operation of any
statute of limitations, the Registrar-General may, when creating the folio, include in
the caution recorded therein a notation to that effect.
(2) In any caution recorded under subsection (1) in a qualified folio of the Register, the
Registrar-General may indicate that, for the purpose of creating an ordinary folio of
the Register for other land, a chain of title evidencing the title to land for which the
qualified folio was created has been accepted by the Registrar-General up to a
specified deed registered under Division 1 of Part 23 of the Conveyancing Act 1919.
(3) Where a caution contains any such indication, the qualified folio of the Register shall,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Part, not be subject to any interest arising
under an instrument registered under Division 1 of Part 23 of the Conveyancing Act
1919 before the registration of the specified deed referred to in subsection (2), other

Lapsing of caution on qualified folio created after registered deed for value (section
28J (1))
(1) This section sets out the 2 ways in which a caution recorded on a qualified folio of the
Register under section 28J (1) that does not include a notation under section 28J (1A)
or (1B) may lapse.
(2) Firstly, if after the creation of the qualified folio, a person for valuable consideration
and without fraud to which the person is a party becomes registered or, pursuant to
section 36 (8), is deemed to have become registered, as proprietor of an estate or
interest in the land comprised in the folio, the caution recorded on the folio lapses as
regards the estate or interest—
(a) on the expiration of 6 years after the creation of the folio, or
(b) when the person becomes, or is deemed to have become, registered,
whichever is the later.
(3) Secondly, if immediately before the expiration of 12 years after the creation of the
qualified folio, the caution affecting the folio has not lapsed as regards all estates and
interests in the land comprised in the folio or been cancelled, the caution lapses on
the expiration of that period.
28MA
Lapsing of caution on qualified folio created after registered deed other than for
value (section 28J (1A))
(1) This section sets out the 2 ways in which a caution recorded on a qualified folio of the
Register under section 28J (1) that includes a notation under section 28J (1A) but does
not include a notation under section 28J (1B) may lapse.
(2) Firstly, if after the creation of the qualified folio, a person for valuable consideration
and without fraud to which the person is a party becomes registered or, pursuant to
section 36 (8), is taken to have become registered, as proprietor of an estate or
interest in the land comprised in the folio, and another person subsequently for
valuable consideration and without fraud to which that other person is a party
becomes, or is taken to have become, registered as proprietor of that estate or
interest, the caution recorded on the folio lapses as regards the estate or interest—
(a) on the expiration of 6 years after the time when the firstmentioned person
becomes, or is taken to have become, registered, or
(b) at the time the other person becomes, or is taken to have become, registered,

whichever is the later.
(3) Secondly, if—
(a) after the creation of the qualified folio, a person for valuable consideration and
without fraud to which the person is a party becomes registered or, pursuant to
section 36 (8), is deemed to have become registered, as proprietor of an estate or
interest in the land comprised in the folio, and
(b) immediately before the expiration of 12 years after the person becomes, or is
deemed to have become, so registered, the caution has not lapsed as regards the
estate or interest or been cancelled,
the caution lapses as regards the estate or interest on the expiration of that period.
28MB
Effect of lapsing of caution under section 28M or 28MA
(1) If a caution lapses under section 28M or 28MA then, subject to subsection (2), the
lapsing operates to free the land or the estate or interest in respect of which the
caution lapses from any interests that affected the land at the date on which it was
brought under this Act by the creation of a qualified folio of the Register.
(2) However, the lapsing of a caution under section 28M or 28MA does not operate to
defeat a subsisting interest that—
(a) was, immediately before the lapsing—
(i) recorded in the qualified folio, or
(ii) the subject of a caveat affecting land comprised in the qualified folio, or
(b) is preserved by section 42.
(3) The provisions of this section and sections 28M (3) and 28MA (3) do not operate to
defeat the estate or interest of a mortgagor in land in respect of which a Registrar-
General’s caveat has been recorded under section 12B (2).
28MC
Application for cancellation of caution accompanied by search
(1) This section applies in respect of a caution recorded on a qualified folio of the Register
under section 28J (1) including a caution with a notation under section 28J (1A) but
excluding a caution with a notation under section 28J (1B).
(2) The registered proprietor of land comprised in a qualified folio on which a caution in
respect of which this section applies is noted may, at any time, apply to the Registrar-
General in the approved form for cancellation of the caution recorded in the folio.

(a) the application is accompanied by an office copy of a certificate of the result of a

any other evidence that the Registrar-General may request, and
(a1) the Registrar-General has had regard to a survey report and an identification
survey relating to the land that have been prepared by a registered surveyor, and
(b) the Registrar-General is satisfied that all estates and interests in the land are held
free from any subsisting interests, other than those referred to in section 28MG,
and
(c) the boundaries of the land, in the opinion of the Registrar-General, are adequately
defined without further survey definition.
(4) For the purposes only of enabling a search to be carried out under section 197 of the

and location of the easement, the circumstances surrounding the creation of
the easement and the physical characteristics of any relevant land, or
(ii) in any other case—all persons having a registered estate or interest in land
benefited by the easement, and
(b) consider any submission made by those persons (but only if the submission is
made by the date specified in the notice, being a date later than one month from
the date on which the notice is served).

advertisement in a newspaper rather than by personal or postal service if the
Registrar-General is of the opinion that—
(a) it is appropriate in the circumstances to give notice by advertisement in a
newspaper, and
(b) the relevant easement is unlikely to be of real benefit to the land benefited by the
easement because the land benefited is no longer connected to the land burdened
by the easement in a way that allows access to the site of the easement.
(5) The Registrar-General may cancel a recording in the Register relating to an
easement—
(a) if satisfied that the recording relates to land for which the easement has no
practical application because separate parcels of land that were respectively
burdened and benefited by the easement have been consolidated into a single
parcel, or
(b) if the easement has been released under section 88B of the Conveyancing Act
1919.

hundred and thirty-one, the proprietor of a registered mortgage (in this section
referred to as the prior mortgage) has agreed to postpone such mortgage in its
entirety to a mortgage (in this section referred to as the subsequent mortgage)
affecting the whole of the same land, and no other land which was registered or to be
registered after the prior mortgage, the Registrar-General may register any dealing by
the proprietor of the subsequent mortgage as if the subsequent mortgage had been
registered immediately before the prior mortgage.
(2) The power conferred by subsection (1) shall not be exercised where a registered
mortgage intervenes between the prior mortgage and the subsequent mortgage

instrument postponing the prior mortgage, or by instrument in the prescribed form,
consents to the exercise of such power.
(3) Upon registration of any such dealing the Registrar-General shall make such
recordings in the Register as may be necessary to give effect to the dealing.
56C
Confirmation of identity of mortgagor
(1) Mortgagee must confirm identity of mortgagor Before presenting a mortgage for

proprietor of the land that is security for the payment of the debt to which the

mortgage relates.
(2) Without limiting the generality of subsection (1), the mortgagee is to be considered as
having taken reasonable steps to ensure the identity of the mortgagor under
subsection (1) if the mortgagee has taken the steps prescribed by the conveyancing
rules.
(3) Record-keeping requirements A mortgagee must keep for a period of 7 years from the
date of registration of the mortgage under this Act (or for such other period as may be
prescribed by the regulations)—
(a) a written record of the steps taken by the mortgagee to comply with subsection
(1), or
(b) a copy of any document obtained by the mortgagee to comply with subsection
(1).
(4) Mortgagee to answer questions and produce documents The Registrar-General, in
determining whether or not this section has been complied with, may at any time
require the mortgagee—
(a) to answer questions in relation to the steps taken by the mortgagee to comply
with subsection (1), and
(b) to produce for inspection any records kept under subsection (3).
(5) If a person fails to comply with a requirement made under subsection (4), the
Registrar-General may—
(a) in relation to a registered mortgage—make a recording in the Register, with
respect to the relevant land, to that effect, and
(b) in relation to a mortgage that has not been registered—refuse to register, or
reject, the mortgage in accordance with section 39 (1A) or refuse to make any
recording or entry in the Register or take any other action in respect of the
mortgage.
(6) Cancellation of recordings in the Register The Registrar-General may cancel, in such
manner as the Registrar-General considers appropriate, any recording in the Register
with respect to a mortgage if the Registrar-General is of the opinion—

proprietor of the mortgaged land, and
(b) that the mortgagee—
(i) has failed to comply with subsection (1), or
(ii) had actual or constructive notice that the mortgagor was not the same person

the land that is security for the payment of the debt to which the mortgage
relates.
(7) Before cancelling a recording of a mortgage in the Register under subsection (6), the
Registrar-General must give notice of the proposed cancellation to the mortgagee and
may also give notice to any other person that the Registrar-General considers should
be notified of the cancellation. Section 12A (2) and (3) apply to and with respect to a
notice given under this section.
(8) Application to transferee of a mortgage This section applies to the transferee of a
mortgage in the same way that it applies to a mortgagee (that is, requiring the
transferee of a mortgage to take reasonable steps to ensure that the person who
executed the mortgage as mortgagor is the same person who is, or is about to
become, the registered proprietor of the land that is security for the payment of the
debt to which the mortgage relates). Accordingly, a reference in this section to—
(a) the presentation of a mortgage includes a reference to the presentation of a
transfer of mortgage, and
(b) the mortgagee includes a reference to the transferee of the mortgage, and
(c) the date of the registration of the mortgage includes a reference to the date of
registration of the transfer of mortgage.

exercise the powers conferred by section 58 if—
(a) in the case of a mortgage or charge, default has been made in the observance of
any covenant, agreement or condition expressed or implied in the mortgage or
charge or in the payment, in accordance with the terms of the mortgage or
charge, of the principal, interest, annuity, rent-charge or other money the
payment of which is secured by the mortgage or charge or of any part of that
principal, interest, annuity, rent-charge or other money,
(a1) in the case of a covenant charge, default has been made in—
(i) the payment, in accordance with the terms of the judgment to which the
covenant charge relates, of the principal, interest or other money the payment
of which is secured by the covenant charge, or
(ii) the payment, in accordance with the terms of that judgment, of any part of
that principal, interest or other money,

(b) where—
(i) the default relates to that payment, or
(ii) in the case of a mortgage, the default does not relate to that payment and
notice or lapse of time has not been dispensed with under section 58A,
a written notice that complies with subsection (3) has been served on the
mortgagor, charger or covenant charger in the manner authorised by section 170
of the Conveyancing Act 1919,
(b1) where a notice is required to be served under paragraph (b), a copy of that
notice has been served (in the manner authorised by section 170 of the
Conveyancing Act 1919) on—
(i) each mortgagee, chargee or covenant chargee (if any) of the land mortgaged
or charged under a registered mortgage, charge or covenant charge which has
less priority than that of the person intending to exercise the power of sale,
and
(ii) each caveator (if any) who claims as an unregistered mortgagee or chargee to
be entitled to an estate or interest in the land mortgaged or charged, and
(iii) each person (if any) who has lodged a priority notice and claims as an
unregistered mortgagee or chargee to be entitled to an estate or interest in
the land mortgaged or charged, and
(c) where such a notice is so served, the requirements of the notice are not complied
with within the time notified pursuant to subsection (3) (d).
(3) A notice referred to in subsection (2) complies with this subsection if—
(a) it specifies that it is a notice pursuant to section 57 (2) (b) of the Real Property Act
1900,
(b) it requires the mortgagor, charger or covenant charger on whom it is served—
(i) to observe, except in relation to any time expressed in the covenant,
agreement or condition for its observance, the covenant, agreement or
condition in respect of the observance of which the mortgagor, charger or
covenant charger made default, or
(ii) as the case may be, to pay the principal, interest, annuity, rent-charge or
other money in respect of the payment of which the mortgagor, charger or
covenant charger made default,
(c) if the costs and expenses of preparing and serving the notice are to be demanded,
it requires payment of a reasonable amount for those costs and expenses and

(d) it notifies the mortgagor, charger or covenant charger that, unless the
requirements of the notice are complied with within one month after service of the
notice (or, where some other period exceeding one month is limited by the
mortgage, charge or judgment for remedying the default referred to in the notice,
within that other period after service of the notice), it is proposed to exercise a
power of sale in respect of the land mortgaged or charged.
(4) Where a notice is served under subsection (2) (b) and the requirements of the notice
are complied with within the time applicable to the notice under subsection (3) (d), the
default to which the notice relates shall be deemed not to have occurred.
(5) Without prejudice to any other manner in which it may be deprived of force or effect,
a covenant, agreement or condition whereby upon a default referred to in subsection
(2) (a)—
(a) the whole of the principal or other money of which the payment is secured by a
mortgage or charge becomes payable, or
(b) a part of that principal or other money (not being a part to which that default
relates) becomes payable,
has no force or effect until the powers conferred by section 58 become exercisable by
reason of that default.
58
Power to sell
(1) Where a mortgagee, chargee or covenant chargee is authorised by section 57 (2) to
exercise the powers conferred by this section, the mortgagee, chargee or covenant
chargee may sell the land mortgaged or charged, or any part thereof, and all the
estate and interest therein of the mortgagor, charger or covenant charger, and either
altogether or in lots by public auction or by private contract, or both such modes of
sale, and subject to such conditions as the mortgagee, chargee or covenant chargee
may think fit, and to buy in and resell the same without being liable for any loss
occasioned thereby, and to make and execute all such instruments as shall be
necessary for effecting the sale thereof, all which sales, contracts, matters, and things
hereby authorised shall be as valid and effectual as if the mortgagor, charger or
covenant charger had made, done, or executed the same, and the receipt or receipts
in writing of the mortgagee, chargee or covenant chargee shall be a sufficient
discharge to the purchaser of such land, estate, or interest, or of any portion thereof,
for so much of the purchaser’s purchase money as may be thereby expressed to be
received.
(2) No such purchaser shall be answerable for the loss, misapplication, or non-application,
or be obliged to see to the application of the purchase money by the purchaser paid,

having been made or served as referred to in section 57 (2).
(3) The purchase money to arise from the sale of any such land, estate, or interest, shall

or covenant chargee; thirdly, in payment of subsequent mortgages, charges or
covenant charges (if any) in the order of their priority; and the surplus (if any) shall be

58A
Dispensing with notice or lapse of time
(1) Any notice or lapse of time prescribed by section 57 (not being notice or lapse of time
relating to default in the payment, in accordance with the terms of the mortgage or
charge, of any principal, interest, annuity, rent-charge or other money) may, by
agreement expressed in the mortgage or charge, be dispensed with, and in such case
section 58 shall operate as if no notice or lapse of time were thereby required.
(2) This section does not apply to covenant charges but applies to mortgages and
charges made before or after the commencement of the Real Property (Amendment)
Act 1976 and, to the extent to which an agreement dispensing with notice or lapse of
time expressed in such a mortgage or charge is not authorised by subsection (1), the
agreement has no force or effect.

Registration of transfer by mortgagee, chargee or covenant chargee
The Registrar-General shall, for the purpose of a sale authorised by section 58, register a
transfer executed by a mortgagee, chargee or covenant chargee in the approved form

charger in the land comprised in the transfer shall pass to and be vested in the transferee,
freed and discharged from all liability on account of the mortgage, charge or covenant
charge, or of any mortgage, charge or covenant charge registered subsequent thereto.

or implied in the mortgage, charge or covenant charge,

made such entry or brought such proceedings if the principal sum, interest, annuity, or
rent-charge were secured to the mortgagee, chargee or covenant chargee by a
conveyance of the legal estate in the land so mortgaged or charged.
61
Application for foreclosure order
(1) When default has been made in the payment of the interest or principal sum secured
by a mortgage or covenant charge for six months, a registered mortgagee or
covenant chargee, as the case may be, or his or her solicitor, attorney, or agent may

with under section 58A) in accordance with section 57 to the mortgagor or
covenant charger and all other persons (if any) required to be given notice under
that section,
(c) that the amount of the highest bid at the sale was not sufficient to satisfy the
money secured by the mortgage or covenant charge, together with expenses
occasioned by the sale, and

the NSW Trustee and Guardian within one month after such notice has been so
given.
(c) The provision made by this subsection for the giving of notice of intention to make

in accordance with the directions of the Registrar-General.
(2) If the applicant is required to offer the land for sale and it is not sold or an insufficient
amount is realised by the sale to satisfy the principal sum and interest due, and all
expenses occasioned by the sale, the Registrar-General may issue to the applicant an
order for foreclosure.
(3) Every order for foreclosure issued by the Registrar-General and recorded in the
Register has the effect of vesting in the mortgagee or covenant chargee who applied
for it all the estate and interest of the mortgagor or covenant charger in the land
mentioned in the order—
(a) in every case, free from any right of a mortgagee, chargee or covenant chargee
under a registered mortgage, charge or covenant charge which has less priority
than that of the applicant, and
(b) in the case of mortgaged land, free from any right and equity of redemption of the
mortgagor or any person claiming through or under the mortgagor.
63
Suspension of mortgagor’s rights as landlord
(1) Whenever a mortgagee, chargee or covenant chargee gives notice of demanding to
enter into receipt of the rents and profits of the mortgaged or charged land to the
tenant or occupier or other person liable to pay or account for the rents and profits
thereof, all the powers and remedies of the mortgagor, charger or covenant charger in
regard to receipt and recovery of, and giving discharges for, such rents and profits,
shall be suspended and transferred to the said mortgagee, chargee or covenant
chargee until such notice is withdrawn, or the mortgage, charge or covenant charge is
satisfied, and a discharge thereof duly registered.
(2) In every such case, the receipt in writing of the mortgagee, chargee or covenant
chargee shall be a sufficient discharge for any rents and profits therein expressed to
be received, and no person paying the same shall be bound to inquire concerning any
default or other circumstance affecting the right of the person giving such notice
beyond the fact of the person’s being duly registered as mortgagee, chargee or
covenant chargee of the land.
(3) Nothing herein contained shall interfere with the effect of any judgment or order of
the Supreme Court in regard to the payment of rent under the special circumstances
of any case, nor shall prejudice any remedy of the mortgagor, charger or covenant
charger against the mortgagee, chargee or covenant chargee for wrongful entry or for
an account.

ancillary orders as it thinks fit.
(6) For the purposes of this section, a caveator served with a notice under section 74JA
(3) (in relation to a restrictive covenant) is taken to have a claim that has substance if
the caveator—

Section 36 (6AA) provides that a caveat that is uplifted after it is lodged with the Registrar-General is ineffective until it is
relodged with the Registrar-General.
74L
Strict compliance with formalities with respect to caveats not necessary
If in any legal proceedings a question arises as to the validity of a caveat lodged under a
provision of this Part, the court shall disregard any failure of the caveator to comply
strictly with the requirements of this Part, and of any regulations or conveyancing rules
made for the purposes of this Part, with respect to the form of the caveat.
74LA

(1) If the operation of a caveat is extended for a specified period by an order of the
Supreme Court under this Part and no further order is made by the Court extending
the operation of the caveat before the expiration of the period specified in the order,
the caveat lapses on the expiration of that period.
(2) If the operation of a caveat is extended until the further order of the Court by an order
of the Supreme Court under this Part, the caveat lapses if the Registrar-General, on
being satisfied that the proceedings in which the order was obtained have been
finalised and that no further order is likely to be sought, makes a recording in the
Register to the effect that the caveat has lapsed.

to withdraw the caveat to which the proceedings relate, to withdraw the caveat
within a specified time, and

another provision of this Part, or
(c) is withdrawn or lapses under section 74MA,
and the same caveator lodges a further caveat with the Registrar-General in respect of
the same estate, interest or right and purporting to be based on the same facts as the
first caveat.
(2) A further caveat to which this section refers has no effect unless—
(a) the Supreme Court has made an order giving leave for the lodgment of the further
caveat and the order or an office copy of the order accompanies the further caveat

subsisting interest in land within the meaning of section 28A.
74T
Lodgment of priority notices
(1) A person who intends to lodge a dealing to give effect to an entitlement to a legal or
equitable estate or interest in land claimed by the person may lodge a priority notice
with the Registrar-General with respect to the proposed dealing and any associated
dealings (for example, a mortgage created over land that has been sold).
(2) A priority notice must be in the approved form and lodged in the manner approved by
the Registrar-General.
(3) A person who has lodged a priority notice with respect to a proposed dealing cannot
lodge another priority notice with respect to the same dealing unless all previous
notices with respect to that dealing are withdrawn or have otherwise ceased to have
effect.
Note—
Previous priority notices may be withdrawn for the purposes of this subsection at the same time that the
new priority notice is lodged.
(4) If a priority notice is in the approved form, the Registrar-General may accept lodgment
of the priority notice as sufficient evidence that the person who lodged the priority
notice, or who had the priority notice lodged on the person’s behalf, is entitled to
lodge the priority notice.
(5) Without limiting subsection (4), the Registrar-General may require a person who
lodges a priority notice to provide, within a reasonable period specified by the
Registrar-General, such evidence as the Registrar-General may require relating to the
person’s entitlement to lodge the notice or the intended timing for the lodgment of a
dealing to which the notice relates.
Note—
The Registrar-General may remove a recording of a priority notice under section 74X (2) if evidence that is

requirements made in respect of it by and under this Act, record in the Register such
particulars of the notice as the Registrar-General considers appropriate (including its
current expiry date).
74V
Period during which priority notice has effect

(a) 60 days from the date of its lodgment, or
(b) if that period is extended under this section—90 days from the date of its

duration if—
(a) the notice is withdrawn before that expiry, or
(b) the dealing or dealings to which the notice relates are lodged before that expiry
and the dealing or dealings are registered, withdrawn or rejected by the Registrar-
General, or

section 74X (2) (b), (c) or (d) before that expiry.
(3) A person who has lodged a priority notice may apply to the Registrar-General, in the
approved form and manner, for an extension of the period of a priority notice by a
single additional period of 30 days.
(4) The Registrar-General is to grant an extension if the application is duly made before
the expiry of the initial 60-day period.
(5) If more than one priority notice is lodged with respect to the same land, the period
during which each notice has effect is to be determined by reference to the lodgment
date for the notice concerned.

(b) any plan (including a plan to which section 88B of the Conveyancing Act 1919

by personal or postal service. Notice may be given to a person by advertisement only

not satisfied that a person directed to meet the service obligations under this Division
has met those obligations in the manner and form approved by the Registrar-General.
(4) If the person directed under this section proves to the satisfaction of the Registrar-
General that the person has tried to serve all relevant persons personally or by
registered post, the Registrar-General may, if he or she considers it appropriate in
accordance with section 81G (2), decide that the persons who have not been given
such notice may be given notice by advertisement under that subsection. The
Registrar-General may further direct the person to give that notice and to verify by
