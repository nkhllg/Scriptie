Environmental Planning and Assessment Regulation 2021 [NSW]
Current version for 4 April 2025 to date (accessed 8 April 2025 at 19:26)
Page 144 of 302

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) conservation of biological diversity and ecological integrity,
(d) improved valuation, pricing and incentive mechanisms.
(2) The precautionary principle is that if there are threats of serious or irreversible
environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason
for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation.
(3) In applying the precautionary principle, public and private decisions should be guided
by—
(a) careful evaluation to avoid, wherever practicable, serious or irreversible damage
to the environment, and
(b) an assessment of the risk-weighted consequences of various options.
(4) The principle of inter-generational equity is that the present generation should ensure
the health, diversity and productivity of the environment are maintained or enhanced
for the benefit of future generations.
(5) The principle of the conservation of biological diversity and ecological integrity is that
the conservation of biological diversity and ecological integrity should be a
fundamental consideration.
(6) The principle of improved valuation, pricing and incentive mechanisms is that
environmental factors should be included in the valuation of assets and services, such
as—
(a) polluter pays, that is, those who generate pollution and waste should bear the
cost of containment, avoidance or abatement, and
(b) the users of goods and services should pay prices based on the full life cycle of
the costs of providing the goods and services, including the use of natural
resources and assets and the ultimate disposal of waste, and
(c) established environmental goals should be pursued in the most cost effective way
by establishing incentive structures, including market mechanisms, that enable
those best placed to maximise benefits or minimise costs to develop their own
solutions and responses to environmental problems.

Publication of environmental impact statements—the Act, s 5.8
