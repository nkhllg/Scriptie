(a) Part 4 of the Act does not operate to require development consent by the Minister
or other consent authority, and
(b) Part 5.1 of the Act does not operate to require the approval of the Minister,
for any project, or for any part of a project, that is a transitional Part 3A project and

(3) This clause is subject to the other provisions of this Schedule.
3A
Projects that cease to be dealt with under Part 3A
(1) Approval cannot be granted for the carrying out of a transitional Part 3A project if the
development concerned is a transitional Part 3A project only because it is the subject
of—
(a) an approved concept plan, or
(b) environmental assessment requirements for approval of a concept plan, or
(c) an environmental assessment for approval of a concept plan.
However, approval may be granted to such a project if it is to be granted under

when the concept plan is modified).
(2) An application under Part 3A for approval to carry out such a project cannot be lodged
or dealt with.
(3) This clause does not prevent the determination of an application for approval of a
concept plan.
3B
Provisions applying with respect to approval of concept plans
(1) This clause applies to development (other than an approved project) for which a
concept plan has been approved under Part 3A, before or after the repeal of Part 3A,
and so applies whether or not the project or any stage of the project is or was a

(whether or not a determination was made under section 75P(1)(b) when the concept
plan was approved)—

to be development that may be carried out with development consent under Part
4 (despite anything to the contrary in an environmental planning instrument),

(b) if Part 5 applies to the carrying out of the development, the development is taken
to be development that may be carried out without development consent under
Part 4 (despite anything to the contrary in an environmental planning instrument),
(c) any development standard that is within the terms of the approval of the concept
plan has effect,
(d) a consent authority must not grant consent under Part 4 for the development
unless it is satisfied that the development is generally consistent with the terms of
the approval of the concept plan,
(e) a consent authority may grant consent under Part 4 for the development without
complying with any requirement under any environmental planning instrument
relating to a master plan,
(f) the provisions of any environmental planning instrument or any development
control plan do not have effect to the extent to which they are inconsistent with
the terms of the approval of the concept plan,
(g) this clause applies instead of section 75P(2), but any direction, order or
determination made under section 75P(2) in connection with the concept plan
continues to have effect.
(3) If a determination was not made under section 75P(1)(b) in relation to the project (or
any stage of the project) when any such concept plan was approved and the project
(or that stage) can no longer be approved under Part 3A, Part 4 is taken to apply to
the carrying out of the development in relation to the project (or that stage) for the
purposes of subclause (2) (unless an environmental planning instrument provides that
it is development that may be carried out without development consent or it is
exempt development).
(4) For the purposes of determining whether development to which Part 4 applies is State
significant development, a provision of this clause that permits the development to be
carried out with development consent under Part 4 is taken to be a provision of an
environmental planning instrument.
(5) This clause does not apply to development that is State significant infrastructure.
(5A) Subclause (2)(f) does not apply to the provisions of State and Environmental
Planning Policy (Transport and Infrastructure) 2021, Chapter 6.
(6) The amendments made to this Schedule by the Environmental Planning and
Assessment Amendment (Transitional) Regulation 2016 extend to things done before
the commencement of those amendments.

miscalculation, or
(b) the proposed modification is of minimal environmental impact, or
(c) the project to which the concept plan as modified relates is substantially the same
as the project to which the concept plan currently relates (including any

Modification of environmental assessment provisions—sections 75H and 75I
For the purposes of the application of Part 3A to a transitional Part 3A project—

(2) Without limiting subclause (1), on and from the commencement of this subclause, a
reference in clause 6 of either of the Redfern–Waterloo contributions plans to a project
to which Part 3A of the EP&A Act applies is taken to include a reference to State
significant development.
(3) The Redfern–Waterloo contributions plans, as taken to be amended by subclause (2),
apply to development for which a development application was made but not
determined before the commencement of that subclause in the same way as they

development that were projects) to which Part 3A applied immediately before its
repeal may be declared to be State significant infrastructure by an order of the
Minister (published in the Gazette).

or not the development is a transitional Part 3A project. On the making of the
declaration it ceases to be a transitional Part 3A project.
(3) Despite anything to the contrary in any environmental planning instrument, any such
development that is declared to be State significant infrastructure is taken to be
development that may be carried out without development consent under Part 4.
(4) For the purposes of Part 5.1 of the Act in its application to any such development—
(a) a concept plan approved under Part 3A in relation to the development (whether
before or after the repeal of Part 3A) is taken to be an approval (and the concept
proposals) for a staged infrastructure application under Division 3 of Part 5.1, and
(b) any approval under Part 3A to carry out development is taken to be approval
under Division 5.2 for the carrying out of that development, and

preferred infrastructure report by a proponent or other action taken under the
corresponding provisions of Part 5.1, unless the Secretary directs that any such
action be taken again under Part 5.1.
(4A) Despite subclause (4), a request to modify an approved project or concept plan
under section 75W that, by operation of clause 3BA(4), cannot be dealt with under
that section is not taken to be an action taken under a provision of Part 5.1.
(5) If a single proposed development comprises development that is only partly State
significant infrastructure declared under this clause, the remainder of the
development (except so much of the remainder of the development as is State

an approval for a staged infrastructure application (see clause 5(4)(a) of this Schedule).
(2) Section 115ZI applies to a modification request to which this clause applies as if that
request were a request to modify a Minister’s approval within the meaning of that

and was not determined before the approval lapsed, the approval is revived for the
purposes of the application of this clause and of any other request made before that
commencement in relation to the approval. In that case, the period of 12 months
referred to in subclause (3) is taken to be the 12 months after the commencement of
this clause.

assessment, any public exhibition, any response to submissions by a proponent or
any other action under Part 3A in relation to the development are taken to be

Transitional provisions
(1AA) The Secretary may accept, as an application for approval of a project under Part 3A
of the Act, any development application made under Part 4 of the Act with respect to
any development before it becomes a project to which Part 3A of the Act applies. The
Secretary may, for that purpose, require any matter to be provided by the applicant
that he or she could require to be included in the application under section 75E of the
Act.
(1) The Secretary may adopt (with or without modification), as environmental assessment
requirements for a project or concept plan, environmental assessment requirements
issued by the Secretary under Part 4 or Part 5 of the Act with respect to any
development or activity before it becomes a project to which Part 3A of the Act
applies.
(2) The Secretary may accept (with or without modification), as an environmental
assessment for a project or part of a project or concept plan—
(a) an environmental impact statement obtained in accordance with the requirements
of the Secretary under Part 4 or Part 5 of the Act with respect to any development
or activity before it becomes a project or part of a project to which Part 3A of the
Act applies, or
(b) a statement of environmental effects (as referred to in clause 2(1)(c) of Schedule
1) prepared in connection with the development concerned before it becomes a
project or part of a project to which Part 3A of the Act applies, or
(c) a written assessment arising out of the consideration, under section 111 of the
Act, of the environmental impact of an activity and prepared before the activity
becomes a project or part of a project to which Part 3A of the Act applies.
(2A) If the Secretary accepts (with or without modification) an environmental impact
statement, a statement of environmental effects or a written assessment as an
environmental assessment for a project or part of a project or a concept plan—
(a) the Secretary is taken to have prepared environmental assessment requirements
in respect of the project or part of a project or concept plan, and
(b) the environmental assessment as so accepted is taken to comply with those
requirements.
(3) The Secretary may accept, as a period of public availability of the environmental

assessment for a project or part of a project or concept plan (under section 75H(3) of
the Act), a period of public exhibition of an environmental impact statement or a
statement of environmental effects referred to in subclause (2) before the relevant
development or activity becomes a project or part of a project to which Part 3A of the
Act applies. For that purpose, and to avoid doubt, if the period of public exhibition is
less than 30 days, it is accepted only to the extent of the actual period of public
exhibition.
(3A) If any such period of public exhibition of an environmental impact statement or a
statement of environmental effects is accepted by the Secretary, the proponent must
provide the Secretary with any written submissions made during the public exhibition
period in relation to the relevant development or activity.
(4) Despite its repeal, section 88A of the Act continues to apply (and Parts 3A and 5.1 and
Division 4.1 of Part 4 of the Act do not apply) to development that is the subject of a
development application that was directed to be referred to the Minister under that
section before its repeal.
(4A) If a development application is made after the commencement of Part 3A of the Act
in respect of any development that—
(a) was, immediately before the repeal of section 89 of the Act, the subject of a
direction under that section, and
(b) is not a project to which Part 3A of the Act applies,
the Minister may direct that the application is to be determined (unless the
development application is withdrawn by the applicant) as if the amendments made
to the Act by Schedule 1 to the Environmental Planning and Assessment Amendment
(Infrastructure and Other Planning Reform) Act 2005 had not been made.
(5) If a development application is made after the commencement of Part 3A of the Act in
respect of any development that, immediately before the commencement of Part 3A,
was declared to be State significant development by notice in force under
section76A(7) of the Act, the Minister may direct that the application is to be
determined (unless the development application is withdrawn by the applicant) as if
the amendments made to the Act by Schedule 1 to the Environmental Planning and
Assessment Amendment (Infrastructure and Other Planning Reform) Act 2005 had not
been made.
(6) Clause 89 of Part 17 to Schedule 6 to the Act extends to development applications
pending on the commencement of Part 3A of the Act for development that was State
significant development on the commencement of the State Environmental Planning
Policy (State Significant Development) 2005.

(a) a development application was made before the commencement of Part 3A of the
Act on the basis that the development was State significant development, and
(b) the Minister is required to form an opinion that the development is State
significant development in order to determine the application on that basis (but
the Minister had not, before that commencement, formed an opinion on the
matter),
the Minister may, after that commencement, form an opinion that the development
was, at the time the application was made, State significant development. In that
case, the application is to be determined (unless withdrawn by the applicant) as if the
amendments made to the Act by Schedule 1 to the Environmental Planning and
Assessment Amendment (Infrastructure and Other Planning Reform) Act 2005 had not
been made.
Note.
The references to State significant development in this subclause refer to the meaning that term had before
the commencement of Part 3A and not to its current meaning.
(8) For the purposes only of modification, the following development consents are taken
to be approvals under Part 3A of the Act and section 75W of the Act applies to any
modification of such a consent—
(a) a development consent granted by the Minister under section 100A or 101 of the
Act,
(b) a development consent granted by the Minister under State Environmental
Planning Policy No 34—Major Employment-Generating Industrial Development,
(c) a development consent granted by the Minister under Part 4 of the Act (relating to
State significant development) before 1 August 2005 or under clause 89 of
Schedule 6 to the Act,
(d) a development consent granted by the Land and Environment Court, if the original
consent authority was the Minister and the consent was of a kind referred to in
paragraph (c).
The development consent, if so modified, does not become an approval under Part 3A
of the Act.
(8A) Subclause (8), as in force before its substitution by the Environmental Planning and
Assessment Amendment (Miscellaneous) Regulation 2010, applies to any
development consent for which approval for the treatment of the consent as an
approval for the purposes of section 75W of the Act—
(a) was given before that substitution, or
(b) is given after that substitution, but where the application for the approval was

made before that substitution.
(8B) The Secretary may waive any fee payable in respect of an application under section
75W of the Act if the application relates to a development consent that is taken to be
an approval under Part 3A of the Act and a fee has been paid in respect of the
application under section 96 of the Act.
(9) For the purposes of this clause, and to avoid doubt, a development application is
made by a person when the person first applies to the consent authority for consent to
carry out the particular development, whether or not the application at that time had
been consented to by the owner of the land to which the development application
relates.
8K
Transitional provision—existing mining leases
(1) Despite its repeal by Schedule 7.11 to the Amending Act, section 74 of the Mining Act
1992 (Mining unaffected by Environmental Planning and Assessment Act 1979)
continues to have effect in respect of an existing mining lease in respect of which
mining operations are carried out underground until—
(a) the end of the relevant transition period, or
(b) such time as an approval is given to carry out mining operations in the mining
area,
whichever is the sooner.
(2) However, if any such approval is limited to the carrying out of mining operations in a
part of the mining area only, section 74 of the Mining Act 1992 continues to have
effect in respect of so much of the existing mining lease as relates to the other parts
of the mining area, but only until the end of the relevant transition period or until such
time as an approval is given to carry out mining operations in those other parts
(whichever is the sooner).
(3) In this clause—
Amending Act means the Environmental Planning and Assessment Amendment
(Infrastructure and Other Planning Reform) Act 2005.
approval means an approval under Part 3A of the Act, but does not include the
approval of a concept plan under that Part.
existing mining lease means a mining lease in force immediately before 16
December 2005.
mining area, mining lease and mining operations have the same meanings as in
the Mining Act 1992.

(b) the period ending on 16 December 2010, in any other case.
8L
Transitional provision—objections under Mining Act in relation to Part 3A projects
(1) The reference in clause 28(b) of Schedule 1 to the Mining Act 1992 to any person who
is entitled to make submissions in relation to the granting of development consent to
use land for the purpose of obtaining minerals or for one or more mining purposes
(the relevant development) is taken to include—
(a) if the relevant development is development to which Part 3A of the Act applies—a
reference to any person who is entitled, under section 75H of the Act, to make a
written submission in relation to the approval of that project, or
(b) if the Secretary has, under clause 8J(3) of this Regulation, accepted a period of
public exhibition of an environmental impact assessment with respect to the
relevant development before it becomes a project to which Part 3A of the Act
applies—a reference to any person who was entitled to make a written submission
during the public exhibition period in relation to the relevant development.
(2) Pursuant to Part 1 of Schedule 6 to the Act, this clause is taken to have commenced
on the commencement of Part 3A of the Act.
8M
Transitional provisions—development consents under Part 4 of the Act and approvals
under Part 5 of the Act
(1) If development is declared to be a project under Part 3A of the Act, any development
consent under Part 4 of the Act or approval under Part 5 of the Act that applies to the
project or land on which the project is to be carried out continues in force despite that
declaration.
(2) If a declaration of a project under Part 3A of the Act is revoked before or after
approval has been given under that Part to carry out the project, the Minister may
make any of the following determinations—
(a) that the whole or part of the effect of the approval is preserved and is taken to be
a development consent granted under Part 4 of the Act by an appropriate consent
authority nominated by the Minister,
(b) that the whole or a specified part of an action under Part 4 or Part 5 of the Act in
respect of the whole or part of a project is revived and has effect,

the purpose of complying with a specified environmental assessment requirement
under Part 4 or Part 5 of the Act.
(3) A determination of the Minister under subclause (2) has effect on the revocation of
the declaration of the project.
(4) Subclause (2) does not apply if a project ceases to be a project to which Part 3A of the
Act applies because of section 75P(1)(b) of the Act.

Projects or concept plans for which approval may not be given concerning
environmentally sensitive land or sensitive coastal locations
(1) For the purposes of sections 75J(3) and 75O(3) of the Act, approval for a project
application may not be given under Part 3A of the Act for any project, or part of a
project, that—

sensitive coastal location, and
(b) is prohibited by an environmental planning instrument that would not (because of
section 75R of the Act) apply to the project if approved.
(2) To avoid doubt, a project is not prohibited for the purposes of subclause (1)(b) if—

the environmental planning instrument, or
(b) it is prohibited under the environmental planning instrument but is permitted to
be carried out because of the application of another environmental planning
instrument to the environmental planning instrument.
(3) In this clause—
environmentally sensitive area of State significance has the same meaning as it
has in State Environmental Planning Policy (State and Regional Development) 2011.
sensitive coastal location has the same meaning as it has in Schedule 4A to the
Act.

amending LEP means a LEP that (apart from provisions for citation, commencement,
definitions, purpose, land to which it applies and similar ancillary provisions) contains
only direct amendments to or repeals of other environmental planning instruments.

(a) Part 3 of the Act and the regulations under the Act, and
(b) Part 5 of the Heritage Act 1977, and
(c) sections 28 and 29 of the Local Government Act 1993,
relating to the making of LEPs, as in force immediately before 1 July 2009 (the date of
commencement of Schedule 1 to the Environmental Planning and Assessment
Amendment Act 2008).
pending LEP means—
(a) a draft principal LEP, if the Secretary was informed of the decision to prepare the
plan under section 54 of the Act before 1 July 2009, or
(b) a draft amending LEP, if the Secretary was informed of the decision to prepare the
plan under section 54 of the Act before 1 July 2009, but only until 1 July 2010 (or if
the Secretary had not issued a certificate under section 65 for public exhibition of
the draft before 1 July 2009, until 1 January 2011).
(2) The former LEP plan-making provisions continue to apply to the making of a pending
LEP unless the Secretary notifies the council that they cease to apply. In that case, the
Minister may, under clause 122(2) of Schedule 6 to the Act, dispense with any
conditions precedent to the making of the LEP (subject to compliance with such other
requirements, if any, as are imposed by the Minister).
(3) Despite subclause (2), section 25 of the Act, as in force immediately before 1 July
2009, does not continue to apply to the making of a pending LEP that is an amending
LEP.
(4) A pending LEP made under the former LEP plan-making provisions is taken to be a LEP
made by the Minister under Division 4 of Part 3 of the Act, as amended by Schedule 1
to the Environmental Planning and Assessment Amendment Act 2008.

12A
Operation of 2010 amending Regulation
(1) This clause applies to any pending LEP to which the former LEP plan-making
provisions continue to apply because of clause 12, as amended by the Environmental
Planning and Assessment Amendment (Transitional Arrangements) Regulation 2010,
but to which those provisions did not apply before the commencement of that
Regulation.
(2) For the purposes of the application of the former LEP plan-making provisions to a
pending LEP to which this clause applies, any thing purporting to have been done or
omitted before the commencement of that Regulation in accordance with the former
LEP plan-making provisions in respect of the pending LEP is taken to have been done
or omitted under and in accordance with the former LEP plan-making provisions.
(3) The amendments to clause 12 made by the Environmental Planning and Assessment
Amendment (Transitional Arrangements) Regulation 2010 apply, but this clause does
not apply, to the proposed local environmental plan relating to South Tralee submitted

Saving of actions taken for preparation of SEPP
Anything done in relation to a proposed SEPP before 1 July 2009 under Division 2 of Part 3

date) taken to have been done under that Division as in force after that date.
15
REPs deemed to be SEPPs—interpretation
(1) A provision of a regional environmental plan that becomes a SEPP on 1 July 2009 does
not prevail over any other environmental planning instrument because the plan
becomes a SEPP on that date if it would not have prevailed over that instrument
before that date.
(2) A provision of a regional environmental plan that becomes a SEPP on 1 July 2009 does
not have the same effect as a provision of a SEPP for the purposes of Part 3A of the
Act if it would not have had that effect before 1 July 2009.
15A
Transitional provision relating to affordable housing
Until the commencement of Part 5B of the Act (to be inserted by Schedule 3 to the
Environmental Planning and Assessment Amendment Act 2008), section 94F(3)(b) of the
Act is to be construed as if the reference to a condition authorised to be imposed by a LEP
(which before the commencement of Schedule 1 to that Act included a reference to a
condition authorised to be imposed by a regional environmental plan) were a reference to
a condition authorised to be imposed by a SEPP or a LEP.

(4) Pending master plans Any master plan lodged under a provision of an environmental
planning instrument but not made or adopted as at the relevant commencement may,
after that commencement, proceed to be made or adopted as if the amendments
made to the Act and this Regulation by Schedules 2 and 7.3 to the 2005 Amending Act
