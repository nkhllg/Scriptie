66F
Definitions
In this Division—
(1) Co-ownership means ownership whether at law or in equity in possession by two or
more persons as joint tenants or as tenants in common; and co-owner has a
corresponding meaning and includes an incumbrancer of the interest of a joint tenant
or tenant in common.
(2)
(a) Property held upon the “statutory trust for sale” shall be held upon trust to sell the
same and to stand possessed of the net proceeds of sale, after payment of costs
and expenses, and of the net income until sale after payment of costs, expenses,
and outgoings, and in the case of land of rates, taxes, costs of insurance, repairs
properly payable out of income, and other outgoings upon such trusts, and subject
to such powers and provisions as may be requisite for giving effect to the rights of
the co-owners,
(b) where—
(i) an undivided share is subject to a settlement, and
(ii) the settlement remains subsisting in respect of other property, and
(iii) the trustees thereof are not the same persons as the trustees for sale,
then the statutory trust for sale includes a trust for the trustees for sale to pay the
proper proportion of the net proceeds of sale or other capital money attributable
to the share to the trustees of the settlement to be held for and to go to the same
persons successively in the same manner and for and on the same estates,
interests, and trusts as the undivided share would if not disposed of have been
held and have gone under the settlement.
(3) Property held upon the “statutory trust for partition” shall be held upon trust—
(a) with the consent of the incumbrancer of the entirety (if any) to partition the
property and to provide (by way of mortgage or otherwise) for the payment of any
equality money, and
(b) upon such partition being made to give effect thereto by assuring the property so
partitioned in severalty (subject or not to any mortgage created for raising
equality money) to the persons entitled under the partition, but a purchaser shall
not be concerned to see or inquire whether any such consent as aforesaid has
been given.

Statutory trusts for sale or partition of property held in co-ownership
(1) Where any property (other than chattels) is held in co-ownership the court may, on
the application of any one or more of the co-owners, appoint trustees of the property
and vest the same in such trustees, subject to incumbrances affecting the entirety,
but free from incumbrances affecting any undivided shares, to be held by them on the
statutory trust for sale or on the statutory trust for partition.
(1A) Subject to this section, on the death of a co-owner, any proceedings by or against
the co-owner under subsection (1) (whether instituted before or after the
commencement of this subsection) survive against or for the benefit of the estate of
the deceased co-owner despite, in the case of a joint tenancy, the rule of survivorship.
(2) Where the entirety of the property is vested in trustees or personal representatives,
those trustees or personal representatives shall, unless the court otherwise
determines, be appointed trustees on either of such statutory trusts, but subject, in
the case of personal representatives, to their rights and powers for the purposes of
administration.
(3)
(a) Where the entirety of the property is vested at law in co-owners the court may
appoint a trust corporation either alone or with one or two individuals (whether or
not being co-owners), or two or more individuals, not exceeding four (whether or
not including one or more of the co-owners), to be trustees of the property on
either of such statutory trusts.
(b) On such appointment the property shall, subject to the provisions of section 78 of
the Trustee Act 1925, vest in the trustees.
(4) If, on an application for the appointment of trustees on the statutory trust for sale,
any of the co-owners satisfies the court that partition of the property would be more
beneficial for the co-owners interested to the extent of upwards of a moiety in value
than sale, the court may, with the consent of the incumbrancers of the entirety (if
any), appoint trustees of the property on the statutory trust for partition, or as to part
of the property on the statutory trust for sale, and as to part on the statutory trust for
partition, but a purchaser shall not be concerned to see or inquire whether any such
consent as aforesaid has been given.
(5)
(a) When such trustees for partition have prepared a scheme of partition they shall
serve notice in writing thereof on all the co-owners of the age of eighteen years or
upwards, and any of such co-owners dissatisfied with the scheme may, within one
month after service upon him or her of such notice, apply to the court for a
variation of the same.

(b) Where any of the co-owners is a person under mental disability, the notice shall
be served on the person charged by law with the management and care of the
property of the person under mental disability or, if there is no person so charged,
on such officer of the court as may be prescribed by rules of court.
(c) Where any of the co-owners is a minor or a person who cannot be found or
ascertained, or as to whom it is uncertain whether the co-owner is living or dead,

(subject to any extension provided for in the contract) by which the sunset event must
occur.

in writing at least 28 days before the proposed rescission that specifies why the
vendor is proposing to rescind the contract and the reason for the sunset event not
occurring by the sunset date.

contract, make an order permitting the vendor to rescind the contract under a sunset
clause, but only if the vendor satisfies the Court that making the order is just and

section if the easement is for the purpose of, or incidental to, the supply of a utility
service to the public, including (but not limited to)—
(a) the supply of gas, water or electricity, or
(b) the supply of drainage or sewage services.
(1C) Nothing in subsection (1B) prevents the creation by a corporation prescribed by the

(b) purports to create a right-of-way or drainage easement without a dominant
tenement, and
(c) purports to create or assure such a right-of-way or drainage easement in favour of
or to a prescribed authority,
the expressions “right of carriage way”, “right of footway”, “easement to drain water”

(a) a body includes any person for the time being authorised by the body, and
(b) a lot includes any other distinct piece or parcel of land (such as an island, a

purposes of this section confers that power on and from the date the corporation is
first so prescribed if the regulations so provide.

does not apply to an easement created or assured before the commencement of that
subsection.

brick veneer construction, or partly of brick construction and partly of brick veneer
construction, whether or not its other walls are so constructed.

does not, by the express use in the instrument under which it arises of terms
appropriate to describe brick veneer construction, operate to prohibit the use of
that form of construction in a building or structure to be erected on that land,
it is not a breach of the restriction to erect on that land a building or structure of brick
veneer construction.

mortgage has not been repaid and the amount thereof determined by the court to be
outstanding is equal to or less than the amount of costs calculated under subsection
(1B) in respect of the determination—
(a) the amount due under the mortgage at the time of the determination shall be
deemed to have been reduced by the amount so determined,
(b) the debt owing under subsection (1C) by the mortgagee to the applicant for the
determination shall be deemed to have been reduced by the amount so
determined, and

has been repaid, whether by the operation of paragraph (c) of subsection (1E) or
otherwise, or
(b) payment into court is made under subsection (1D),
an officer of the court prescribed by rules of court may give a certificate to the effect
that this section has been complied with in relation to the mortgage in respect of
which the determination was made or the money paid into court.
(2) In favour of a purchaser of land comprised in a mortgage referred to in a certificate
given under subsection (1F), the certificate operates as a discharge of the land from
the amount due under the mortgage, and as a deed of conveyance, in the same
manner as a memorandum of discharge operates under subsection (3) of section 91.
(3) The Court shall order an amount paid into court under subsection (1D) to be paid to
the person entitled, upon the application of such person, and on proof that the deed or
instrument of mortgage, and all the title deeds which were delivered by the mortgagor
to the mortgagee on executing the same, or in connection therewith, have been
delivered up to the person by whom the amount was so paid into court, or the
person’s executors, administrators, or assigns, or have been otherwise satisfactorily
accounted for.
(3A) A determination by the court under this section with respect to a mortgage is not, as
between persons referred to in subsection (1), conclusive as to—
(a) whether or not an amount is due under the mortgage at the time of the
determination, or
(b) whether the amount determined by the court to be due under the mortgage is the
amount so due at the time of the determination, and except to the extent of the
operation of paragraph (a) of subsections (1D) and (1E), and of subsection (2),
that determination does not prejudice any right conferred by the mortgage for the
recovery of an amount due thereunder.
(4) This section, subsection (2) excepted, applies to and in respect of mortgages under
the Real Property Act 1900.
(4A) The Registrar-General is to make recordings in the Register kept under the Real
Property Act 1900 as the Registrar-General considers appropriate to give effect to the
discharge of the mortgage if—
(a) an application is made to the Registrar-General in the form approved under that
Act, and
(b) a certificate under subsection (1F) relating to a mortgage under that Act is
produced to the Registrar-General, and

the assigns of the last survivors or survivor, may exercise all powers conferred by the

done; subject as to lands under the provisions of the Real Property Act 1900 to
compliance with the provisions of that Act.
(3) This section applies only to a mortgage, or obligation, or transfer made after the
commencement of this Act, and then only in so far as a contrary intention is not

creating the mortgage or the covenant in respect of which the charge arose, or
otherwise in writing, and shall have effect subject to the terms and conditions of that
instrument, or any such writing.
(12) Nothing in this Act shall prevent the instrument creating the mortgage or the
covenant in respect of which the charge arose from reserving to or conferring on

this Act, but the provisions thereof, or any of them, may by agreement in writing,
made after the commencement of this Act between mortgagor and mortgagee, be

the mortgaged or charged land has been appointed under this Act by the mortgagee

in force by that mortgagee or person instead of by the mortgagor or person whose
land is subject to the charge in relation to any land affected by the receivership in the
same manner as it would be if the mortgagee or person having the benefit was in
possession of the land and the mortgagee or person may, by deed, delegate that
power to the receiver.
(16A) Where a trust corporation has been appointed receiver pursuant to section
115(6A), a delegation under subsection (16) by that trust corporation in its capacity as
mortgagee or person having the benefit of a charge shall be sufficiently evidenced by

possession shall, in like manner as if the legal estate were vested in the mortgagor
and as against every incumbrancee, have, by virtue of this Act, power to accept from
time to time a surrender of any lease of the mortgaged land or any part thereof
comprised in the lease, with or without an exception of all or any of the mines and
minerals therein, or in respect of mines and minerals, or any of them, and, on a
surrender of part only of the land or mines and minerals leased, the rent may be
apportioned.

to the charge, have, by virtue of this Act, power to accept from time to time any such
surrender as aforesaid.
(3) On a surrender of part only of the land or mines and minerals leased the original lease
may be varied: Provided that the lease when varied would have been valid as an
authorised lease if granted by the person accepting the surrender, and on a surrender
and the making of a new or other lease, whether for the same or for an extended or
other term, and whether subject or not to the same or to any other covenants,
provisions, or conditions, the value of the lessee’s interests in the lease surrendered
may, subject to the provisions of this section, be taken into account in the
determination of the amount of the rent to be reserved and of the nature of the
covenants, provisions, and conditions to be inserted in the new or other lease.
(4) Nothing in this section shall, where any consideration (except an agreement to accept
an authorised lease) for the surrender is given by or on behalf of the lessee to or on
behalf of the person accepting the surrender, authorise a surrender to a mortgagor or
person whose land is subject to a charge without the consent of the incumbrancees,
or authorise a surrender to a second or subsequent incumbrancee without the consent
of any prior incumbrancee.

comprised in the surrender, to take effect in possession immediately or within one
month after the date of the surrender, and
(b) the term certain or interest granted by the new lease is not less in duration than
the unexpired term or interest which would have been subsisting under the
original lease if that lease had not been surrendered, and
(c) where the whole of the land mines and minerals originally leased has been
surrendered, the rent reserved by the new lease is not less than the rent which
would have been payable under the original lease if it had not been surrendered;
or where part only of the land or mines and minerals has been surrendered, the
aggregate rents respectively remaining payable or reserved under the original
lease and new lease are not less than the rent which would have been payable
under the original lease if no partial surrender had been accepted, and
(d) a memorandum thereof, signed by the parties thereto, is registered.
(6) A contract to make or accept a surrender under this section may be enforced by or
against every person on whom the surrender, if completed, would be binding.

contrary intention is expressed in the instrument creating the mortgage or the
covenant in respect of which the charge arose.

the income of the mortgaged or charged land has been appointed under this Act by
the mortgagee or person having the benefit of the charge and the instrument by
which the appointment was made has been registered, be exercisable while that
appointment is in force by that mortgagee or person instead of by the mortgagor or
person whose land is subject to the charge in relation to any land affected by the
receivership in the same manner as it would be if the mortgagee or person having the
benefit was in possession of the land and the mortgagee or person may, by deed,
delegate that power to the receiver.

of sale vested in him or her have power to convey the reversion for all the estate
which was held by the mortgagor at the date of the mortgage, whether the same is by

unauthorised or improper or irregular exercise of the power shall have a remedy in
damages against the person exercising the power.

creating the mortgage or the covenant under which the charge arose.

person entitled to exercise the same may demand and recover from any person other
than a person having in the mortgaged or charged property an estate, interest, or
right in priority to the mortgage or charge, all the deeds and documents relating to

paying or transferring the same to the mortgagee or chargee shall not be concerned
to inquire whether any money remains due under the mortgage or charge or to see to
the application of the money or securities so paid or transferred.

in case such former lease had been still continued or as the chief landlord would have
had in case the respective under-leases had been renewed under such new principal

extend only to the permission actually given or to any specific breach of any proviso or
covenant made, or to be made, or to the actual assignment under-lease or other matter
thereby specifically authorised to be done, but not so as to prevent any proceeding for

to do any other act prohibited to be done without licence, or is given to any lessee or
owner, or any one of several lessees or owners, to assign or under-let part only of the
property or to do any other such act as aforesaid in respect of part only of such property,
such licence shall not operate to destroy or extinguish the right of re-entry in case of any
breach of the covenant or condition by co-lessees or owners of the other shares or
interests in the property, or by the lessee or owner of the rest of the property, as the case
may be, over or in respect of such shares or interests or remaining property, but such
right of re-entry shall remain in full force over or in respect of the shares or interests or
property not the subject of such licence.

forfeiture, under any covenant, proviso, or stipulation in a lease made either before or
after the commencement of this Act or for non-payment of rent, the Court may, on
application by any person claiming as under-lessee any estate or interest in the
property comprised in the lease, or any part thereof, make an order staying any such
action or other proceeding on such terms as to the Court may seem just, and vesting,
for the whole term of the lease, or any less term, the property comprised in the lease,
or any part thereof, in any person entitled as under-lessee to any estate or interest in
such property, upon such conditions as to execution of any deed or other document,
payment of proper and reasonable rent, costs, expenses, damages, compensation,
giving security, or otherwise as the Court in the circumstances of each case, and
having regard to the consent or otherwise of the lessor to the creation of the estate or
interest claimed by the under-lessee, thinks fit; but in no case shall any such under-
lessee be entitled to require a lease to be granted to him or her for a larger area of
land or for any longer term than he or she had under his or her original under-lease.

without the licence or consent of the lessor, assign, underlet, part with the possession, or
dispose of the demised premises or any part thereof, such covenant, condition, or
agreement shall, unless the lease contains an express provision to the contrary, be
deemed to be subject to a proviso to the effect that no fine or sum of money in the nature
of a fine shall, after the commencement of this Act, be payable for or in respect of such
licence or consent; but this proviso shall not preclude the right to require the payment of a
reasonable sum in respect of any legal or other expenses incurred in relation to such

133A
Provisions as to covenants to repair

during the currency of a lease, or to leave or put premises in repair at the termination
of a lease, whether such covenant or agreement is expressed or implied, and whether
general or specific, shall in no case exceed the amount (if any) by which the value of
the reversion (whether immediate or not) in the premises is diminished owing to the
breach of such covenant or agreement as aforesaid; and in particular no damage shall
be recovered for a breach of any such covenant or agreement to leave or put
premises in repair at the termination of a lease, if it is shown that the premises, in
whatever state of repair they might be, would at or shortly after the termination of the
lease have been or be pulled down, or such structural alterations made therein as
would render valueless the repairs covered by the covenant or agreement.
(2) A right of re-entry or forfeiture for a breach of any such covenant or agreement as
aforesaid shall not be enforceable, by action or otherwise, unless the lessor proves

that the fact that such a notice as is required by section 129 had been served on the
lessee was known either—
(a) to the lessee, or
(b) to an under-lessee holding under an under-lease which reserved a nominal
reversion only to the lessee, or
(c) to the person who last paid the rent due under the lease either on the person’s
own behalf or as agent for the lessee or under-lessee,
and that a time reasonably sufficient to enable the repairs to be executed had elapsed
since the time when the fact of the service of the notice came to the knowledge of any
such person.
Where a notice has been sent by post in a registered letter addressed to a person at
the person’s last known place of abode in or out of New South Wales, and that letter is
not returned through the post office undelivered, then, for the purposes of this
subsection, that person shall be deemed, unless the contrary is proved, to have had
knowledge of the fact that the notice had been served as from the time at which the
letter would have been delivered in the ordinary course of post.
This subsection shall be construed as one with section 129.
(3) This section applies whether the lease was created before or after the
commencement of the Conveyancing (Amendment) Act 1930.
133B
Covenants against assigning etc
(1) In all leases whether made before or after the commencement of the Conveyancing
(Amendment) Act 1930 containing a covenant, condition, or agreement against
assigning, underletting, charging, or parting with the possession of demised premises
or any part thereof without licence or consent, such covenant, condition, or agreement
shall, notwithstanding any express provision to the contrary, be deemed to be
subject—
(a) to a proviso to the effect that such licence or consent is not to be unreasonably
withheld, but this proviso does not preclude the right of the lessor to require
payment of a reasonable sum in respect of any legal or other expenses incurred in
connection with such licence or consent, and
(b) (if the lease is for more than forty years and is made in consideration wholly or
partially of the erection, or the substantial improvement, addition, or alteration of
buildings) to a proviso to the effect that in the case of any assignment, under-
letting, charging, or parting with the possession (whether by the holders of the
lease or any under-lessee whether immediate or not) effected more than seven
years before the end of the term no consent or licence shall be required, if notice

in writing of the transaction is given to the lessor within six months after the
transaction is effected.
(2) In all leases whether made before or after the commencement of the Conveyancing
(Amendment) Act 1930 containing a covenant, condition, or agreement against the
making of improvements without licence or consent, such covenant, condition, or
agreement shall be deemed, notwithstanding any express provision to the contrary, to
be subject to the proviso that such licence or consent is not to be unreasonably
withheld; but this proviso does not preclude the right to require as a condition of such
licence or consent the payment of a reasonable sum in respect of any damage to or
diminution in the value of the premises or any neighbouring premises belonging to the
lessor, and of any legal or other expenses properly incurred in connection with such
licence or consent nor, in the case of an improvement which does not add to the
letting value of the holding, does it preclude the right to require as a condition of such
licence or consent, where such a requirement would be reasonable, an undertaking on
the part of the lessee to reinstate the premises in the condition in which they were
before the improvement was executed.
(3) In all leases whether made before or after the commencement of the Conveyancing
(Amendment) Act 1930 containing a covenant, condition, or agreement against the
alteration of the user of the demised premises, without licence or consent, such
covenant, condition, or agreement shall, if the alteration does not involve any
structural alteration of the premises, be deemed, notwithstanding any express
provision to the contrary, to be subject to a proviso that no fine or sum of money in
the nature of a fine, whether by way of increase of rent or otherwise, shall be payable
for or in respect of such licence or consent; but this proviso does not preclude the
right of the lessor to require payment of a reasonable sum in respect of any damage
to or diminution in the value of the premises or any neighbouring premises belonging
to the lessor and of any legal or other expenses incurred in connection with such
licence or consent.
Where a dispute as to the reasonableness of any such sum has been determined by a
court of competent jurisdiction, the lessor shall be bound to grant the licence or
consent on payment of the sum so determined to be reasonable.
(4) Paragraph (b) of subsection (1), and subsections (2) and (3), do not apply to mining
leases.

without any trust or right of redemption affecting the term in favour of the freeholder,
or other person entitled in reversion expectant on the term, and without any rent, or
with merely a peppercorn rent or other rent having no money value, incident to the
reversion, or having had a rent, not being merely a peppercorn rent or other rent
having no money value, or a money value not exceeding four dollars per annum
originally so incident, which subsequently has been released, or has become barred by

lapse of time, or has in any other way ceased to be payable, then the term may be
enlarged into a fee simple in the manner, and subject to the restrictions, in this
section provided.
(2) Each of the following persons, namely—
(a) Any person beneficially entitled in right of the term, whether subject to an
incumbrance or not, to possession of any land comprised in the term,
(b) any person being in receipt of income as trustee, in right of the term, or having
the term vested in him or her in trust for sale, whether subject to any incumbrance
or not,
(c) any person in whom, as legal representative of any deceased person, the term is
vested, whether subject to any incumbrance or not,
shall, as far as regards the land to which the person is entitled, or in which the person
is interested, in right of the term, in any such character as aforesaid, have power by
deed to declare to the effect that, from and after the execution and registration of the
deed, the term shall be enlarged into a fee simple.
(3) Upon registration of the deed the term shall become and be enlarged accordingly, and
the person in whom the term was previously vested shall acquire and have in the land
a fee simple instead of the term.
(4) This section shall apply to and include every such term, whether having as the
immediate reversion thereon the freehold or not; but not—
(a) any term liable to be determined by re-entry for condition broken, or

trusts, powers, executory limitations over, rights, and equities, and to all the same
covenants and provisions relating to user and enjoyment, and to all the same
obligations of every kind, as the term would have been subject to if it had not been so
enlarged.
(6) But where any land so held for the residue of a term has been settled in trust by
reference to other land, being freehold land, so as to go along with that other land as
far as the law permits, and, at the time of enlargement, the ultimate beneficial
interest in the term, whether subject to any subsisting particular estate or not, has not
become absolutely and indefeasibly vested in any person, then the estate in fee
simple acquired as aforesaid shall, without prejudice to any conveyance for value
previously made by a person having a contingent or defeasible interest in the term, be
liable to be, and shall be, conveyed and settled in like manner as the other land, being

without impeachment of waste or not, include the fee simple in all mines and minerals
which at the time of enlargement have not been severed in right or in fact, or are not
reserved to the Crown.

Part 10 Invalid leases under powers
135
Lease deemed to be granted in intended exercise of power
When a valid power of leasing is vested in or may be exercised by a person granting a
lease, and such lease (by reason of the determination of the estate or interest of such
person or otherwise) cannot have effect and continuance according to the terms thereof,
independently of such power, such lease shall, for the purposes of this Part, be deemed to
be granted in the intended exercise of such power, although such power is not referred to
in such lease.
136
Certain invalid leases under powers to be construed as agreements to lease
(1) Where in the intended exercise of any power of leasing, whether derived under an Act
or under any instrument lawfully creating such power, a lease has been or may
hereafter be granted which is, by reason of the non-observance or omission of some
condition or restriction, or by reason of any other deviation from the terms of such
power, invalid as against the person entitled after the determination of the interest of
the person granting such lease to the reversion, or against other the person who,
subject to any lease lawfully granted under such power, would have been entitled for
any estate to the property comprised in such lease, such lease, in case the same has
been made bona fide, and the lessee named therein, the lessee’s executors,
administrators, or assigns (as the case may require), have entered thereunder, shall
be considered in equity as a contract for a grant at the request of the lessee, the
lessee’s executors, administrators, or assigns (as the case may require), of a valid
lease under such power, to the like purport and effect as such invalid lease as
aforesaid, save so far as any variation may be necessary in order to comply with the
terms of such power; and all persons who would have been bound by a lease lawfully
granted under such power shall be bound in equity by such contract—
(2) Provided that no lessee under any such invalid lease as aforesaid, the lessee’s
executors, administrators, or assigns, shall be entitled by virtue of any such equitable
contract as aforesaid to obtain any variation of such lease where the persons who

would have been bound by such contract are willing to confirm such lease without
variation.
(3) Land the subject of any such equitable contract shall, for the purposes of subsection
(2) of section 14 of the Real Property Act 1900, be deemed to be a leasehold.
137
Certain leases validated where grantor could not grant them
(1) Where a lease granted in the intended exercise of any such power of leasing as
aforesaid is invalid by reason that at the time of the granting thereof the person
granting the same could not lawfully grant such lease, but the estate of such person in
the property comprised in such lease has continued after the time when such or the
like lease might have been granted by the person in the lawful exercise of such power,
then and in every such case such lease shall take effect, and be as valid as if the
same had been granted at such last-mentioned time, and all the provisions contained
in this Part shall apply to every such lease—
Provided that this section shall not apply where at the time of the granting of the lease
the person granting the same was under the age of eighteen years, unless the lease is
presumptively binding on the person in accordance with the Minors (Property and
Contracts) Act 1970.
(2) The amendments made to this section by the Minors (Property and Contracts) Act
1970 apply to a lease granted after the commencement of that Act.
138
Confirmation of invalid leases
Where, upon or before the acceptance of rent under any such invalid lease as above
mentioned, any receipt, memorandum, or note in writing, confirming such lease, is signed
by the person accepting such rent, or some other person lawfully authorised by the
person, such acceptance shall, as against the person so accepting such rent, be deemed a
confirmation of such lease.
139
Lessee bound to accept confirmation of lease
Where, during the continuance of the possession taken under any such invalid lease as
above mentioned, the person for the time being entitled (subject to such possession as
aforesaid) to the property comprised in such lease, or to the possession thereof, is able to
confirm such lease without variation, the lessee, the lessee’s executors, or administrators
(as the case may require), or any person who would have been bound by the lease if the
same had been valid, shall, upon the request of the person so able to confirm the same,
be bound to accept a confirmation accordingly; and such confirmation may be by
memorandum or note in writing, signed by the persons confirming and accepting
respectively, or by some other persons by them respectively thereunto lawfully
authorised; and after confirmation and acceptance of confirmation such lease shall be
valid, and shall be deemed to have had from the granting thereof the same effect as if the
same had been originally valid.

named in any such lease as aforesaid, the lessee’s executors, administrators, or assigns
would or might have been entitled under or by virtue of any covenant for title or quiet
enjoyment contained in such lease on the part of the person granting the same, or to

apportionable in respect of time accordingly.
(2) The apportioned part of any such rent, annuity, dividend, or other payment shall be
payable or recoverable in the case of a continuing rent, annuity, or other such
payment, when the entire portion of which such apportioned part forms part becomes
due and payable, and not before; and in the case of a rent annuity or other such
payment determined by re-entry, death, or otherwise, when the next entire portion of
the same would have been payable if the same had not so determined, and not
before.
(3) All persons and their respective executors, administrators, and assigns, and also the
executors, administrators, and assigns respectively of persons whose interests
determine with their own deaths, shall have such or the same remedies, at law and in
equity, for recovering such apportioned parts as aforesaid when payable (allowing
proportionate parts of all just allowances) as they respectively would have had for
recovering such entire portions as aforesaid if entitled thereto respectively—
Provided that where any person is liable to pay rent reserved out of or charged on
lands, that person and the said lands shall not be resorted to for any such apportioned
part forming part of an entire or continuing rent as aforesaid specifically; but the
entire or continuing rent, including such apportioned part, shall be recovered and
received by the person who, if the rent had not been apportionable under this section
or otherwise, would have been entitled to such entire or continuing rent; and such
apportioned part shall be recoverable from such lastmentioned person by the
executors, administrators, or other parties entitled thereto under this section by action
or suit.
(4) Nothing in this section shall render apportionable any annual sums payable under
policies of assurance of any description.
(5) This section shall not extend to any case in which it is expressly stipulated that no
apportionment shall take place.
(6) This section extends to and includes deeds, wills, and other instruments that were

upon payment by the purchaser or the claimant under that purchaser of the full value
of the timber and articles at the time of sale, with such interest thereon as the Court
directs, and the settlement of the said principal moneys and interest under the
direction of the Court upon such parties as in the opinion of the Court are entitled
