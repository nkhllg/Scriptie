may, on the application of any of the co-owners, appoint trustees of 
the property and vest the property in the trustees, subject to

vests in the trustees. 
 
(7) If, on an application for the appointment of trustees on a statutory 
trust for sale, a co-owner who satisfies the Court that partition of the 
property would be more beneficial than sale of the property for the 
co-owners whose interests in the property comprise not less than 
one half of the value of the property, the Court may, with the 
consent of the encumbrancee of the entirety (if any), appoint 
trustees of the property on a statutory trust for partition or on a 
statutory trust for partition as to part of the property and on a 
statutory trust for sale as to the remainder.

other property to represent the person's share.

a statutory trust, the Court may by order alter the statutory trust, 
and the trust so altered is to be taken to be the statutory trust in 
relation to that property. 
 
(12) Without limiting the power of the Court to alter a statutory trust 
under subsection (11), the Court may alter a statutory trust for 
partition to provide that: 
(a) 
an encumbrance which, prior to the appointment of the 
trustees, affected an undivided share is to continue to extend 
and apply to the share; and

property the subject of the order has the same rights and remedies 
at law and in equity that the prior mortgagee would have had if the 
legal estate in the property was vested in the prior mortgagee and 
the mortgagor had a right of quiet enjoyment of the property for as 
long as the mortgagor does not default in the payment of an 
amount of principal money or interest or in the observance or 
fulfilment of another provision contained in the mortgage document 
or implied by this or another Act. 
 
(3) Nothing in this section: 
(a) 
affects the right of a prior mortgagee to exercise the 
mortgagee's right of foreclosure in accordance with this

of making a prior mortgagee of property the subject of the 
order that is leased land liable for the payment of rent under

the lease; and 
(c)

or 
interest 
that

141 and 142 of the Real Property Act 1886, as in force immediately

the permission actually given; 
(b) 
the specific breach of a term or covenant referred to; or

the lessee or, if there is more than one lessee, only one of the 
lessees to assign or underlet part only of the leased premises 
or to do any other act in respect of part only of the leased 
premises, 
the licence does not operate to extinguish the right of entry for a 
breach of a covenant, obligation or condition by the co-lessees in 
respect of the other shares or interests in the premises or by the 
lessee or lessees of any other part or parts of the premises in 
respect of the other shares or interests or other part or parts of the

because there has been a change in the user of the land 
having the benefit of the easement or covenant, in the 
character of the area in the vicinity of the land or in any other 
circumstance that the Court considers material, the easement 
or covenant is obsolete; 
(b) 
the continued existence of the easement or covenant would 
impede the reasonable user of the land or that the easement 
or covenant, in impeding that user, is: 
(i) 
no longer necessary or advantageous to the person or 
persons entitled to the benefit of the easement or 
covenant; or 
(ii) 
contrary to the public interest, 
 
and each person who suffers loss or disadvantage from the 
modification or extinguishment of the easement or covenant 
can be adequately compensated in money for his or her loss 
or disadvantage;

(c) 
each adult who is entitled to the use or benefit of the 
easement or the covenant and who has capacity to do so: 
(i) 
has agreed to the modification or extinguishment of the 
easement or covenant; or 
(ii) 
by his or her acts or omissions may reasonably be 
considered to have abandoned the easement or to have 
waived the benefit of the covenant in whole or in part; or 
(d) 
the proposed modification or extinguishment will not 
substantially injure the persons entitled to the use or benefit of 
the easement or covenant. 
 
(3) In determining whether to make the order, the Court must take into 
account the operation of the Planning Act 1999 and in particular the 
provisions of the planning scheme, within the meaning of that Act, 
applying to the land. 
 
(4) The power of the Court to make an order modifying an easement or 
covenant includes power to amend the instrument creating the 
easement or covenant to include new terms as to the use, 
ownership or maintenance of the servient land. 
 
(5) In making an order under subsection (1), the Court may also make 
an order directing the applicant to pay a person entitled to the use 
or benefit of the easement or covenant the amount that appears to 
the Court to be just to award consideration for either: 
(a) 
any loss or disadvantage suffered as a consequence of the 
modification or extinguishment; or 
(b) 
any reduction in any compensation received for the land 
affected by the easement or covenant when it was created 
that is attributable to its imposition. 
178 
Notice of application 
Where 
an 
application 
is 
made 
for 
the 
modification 
or 
extinguishment of an easement or covenant, the Court may, if it 
thinks just, direct that the applicant must give notice of the 
application in the manner and to the consent authority, within the 
meaning of the Planning Act 1999, or any other person it specifies 
in the direction. 
179 
Effect of order 
An order made under section 177 is binding on all persons, whether 
or not adults or otherwise having capacity, who are or become 
entitled to the use or benefit of the easement, or are or become

notice under section 178. 
180 
Application may be made in other proceedings 
 
(1) Where a person commences proceedings to enforce an easement

(2) Unless the Court orders otherwise, an application under 
subsection (1) operates to stay the proceedings for enforcement of 
the easement or covenant.

Interpretation 
 
(1) In this Part, unless the contrary intention appears: 
power of appointment includes a discretionary power to make a 
disposition. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Part 11 
Perpetuities 
 
 
Law of Property Act 2000 
118 
 
settlement includes: 
(a) 
a will; 
(b) 
an instrument, testamentary or otherwise, exercising a power 
of appointment, whether general or special; and 
(c) 
any other instrument, transaction or dealing whereby a person 
makes a disposition, 
but does not include an Act or an instrument of a legislative or 
administrative character. 
rule against perpetual trusts means the common law rule that 
invalidates a trust (not otherwise invalid) for a purpose which is not 
charitable if the duration of the trust will or may exceed the 
perpetuity period. 
trust has the same meaning as in the Trustee Act 1893. 
trustee has the same meaning as in the Trustee Act 1893. 
will includes a codicil. 
 
(2) For the purposes of this Part, a disposition in a will is to be taken to 
take effect on the death of the testator. 
 
(3) For the purposes of this Part, a person is to be treated: 
(a) 
as a member of a class if the person satisfies, each and every 
condition identifying a member of the class; and 
(b) 
as a potential member of a class if the person satisfies only 
one or some of the conditions identifying a member of the 
class but there is a possibility that the remainder of those 
conditions will in time be satisfied. 
184 
Application 
 
(1) This Part applies in relation to a settlement taking effect before or 
after 1 August 1994. 
 
(2) This Part applies in relation to a settlement exercising a power of 
appointment taking effect after 1 August 1994, whether general or 
special and whether or not it applies in relation to the settlement 
creating the power of appointment. 
 
(3) This Part does not apply to render invalid an interest created by a 
provision of a will executed before 1 August 1994 but taking effect 
after that date if the provision would not have infringed the rule 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Part 11 
Perpetuities 
 
 
Law of Property Act 2000 
119 
 
against perpetuities had the Perpetuities Act 1994 or this Act not 
been enacted and the will taken effect when it was executed. 
185 
Settlements by Crown not bound 
Nothing in the rule against perpetuities, in the rule against perpetual 
trusts or in this Part affects a settlement made by the Crown. 
186 
Powers of appointment 
 
(1) For the purposes of the rule against perpetuities, a power of 
appointment is at a particular time to be treated as a special power 
unless, at that time, the appointor has, by the settlement creating 
the power, unconditional authority at his or her own discretion to 
exercise the power by appointing the interest the subject of the 
power to himself or herself. 
 
(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), an appointment of an interest made 
by will under a power of appointment that would, but for the fact that 
it was made exercisable only by will, have been a general power is 
to be treated as a general power for the purposes of determining 
whether the appointment of the interest infringes the rule against 
perpetuities. 
 
(3) For the purposes of this section, an authority is unconditional 
notwithstanding a formal condition relating to the mode of exercise 
of the power. 
187 
Perpetuity period 
 
(1) For the purposes of the rule against perpetuities but subject to 
subsection (3), the perpetuity period applicable to an interest 
created by a settlement is: 
(a) 
a life in being plus 21 years; or 
(b) 
80 years from the date on which the settlement takes effect, 
whichever is specified in the settlement. 
 
(2) Subject to subsection (3), if no perpetuity period is specified in the 
settlement, the perpetuity period is taken to be 80 years from the 
date on which the settlement takes effect. 
 
(3) If an appointment of an interest is made under a special power of 
appointment, the perpetuity period is reckoned from the date on 
which the settlement creating the power takes effect.

188 
Unborn spouse 
The surviving spouse of a person who is a life in being for the 
purposes of the rule against perpetuities must be treated as a life in 
being for the purpose of the application of the rule to: 
(a) 
a disposition in favour of that surviving spouse; and 
(b) 
a disposition in favour of: 
(i) 
a charity that attains;  
(ii) 
a person who attains; or 
(iii) a class the members of which attain, 
 
according to the terms of the disposition, a vested interest on 
or after: 
(iv) the death of the survivor of a person who is a life in 
being and the person's surviving spouse;  
(v) 
the death of the person's surviving spouse; or 
(vi) the happening of a contingency during the lifetime of the 
person's surviving spouse. 
189 
Presumptions and evidence as to future parenthood 
 
(1) If, in the application of the rule against perpetuities to a disposition 
or in determining the right of a person to put an end to a trust or an 
accumulation, there arises a question that depends on the capacity 
of a person to procreate a child at a future time: 
(a) 
it is presumed, subject to paragraph (b), that: 
(i) 
a male person who has attained the age of 12 years can 
procreate a child (but not if under that age); and 
(ii) 
a female person who has attained the age of 12 years 
can procreate a child (but not if under that age or if she 
has attained the age of 55 years); but 
(b) 
in the case of a living person, evidence may be given in any 
proceedings to show that he or she is or will or is not or will 
not be capable of procreating a child at the time in question. 
 
(2) If, by virtue of subsection (1), a person is treated as incapable of 
procreating a child at a particular time but he or she in fact 
procreates a child, the Supreme Court may make the order it thinks 
just for placing the persons interested in the property comprised in 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Part 11 
Perpetuities 
 
 
Law of Property Act 2000 
121 
 
a disposition as far as reasonably possible in the position they 
would have held if the person was treated as capable of procreating 
a child in applying subsection (1) to the disposition, trust or 
accumulation concerned. 
 
(3) Subject to an order under subsection (2), if, in proceedings relating 
to a disposition, a person is treated by virtue of subsection (1) as 
capable or incapable of procreating a child at a particular time, the 
person must be treated as likewise capable or incapable of 
procreating a child for the purpose of determining a question that 
might arise in the application of the rule against perpetuities to the 
same disposition in subsequent proceedings. 
 
(4) This section, except subsection (1)(b), has effect in relation to the 
possibility that a person may at any time become a parent of 
another person by adoption or the operation of a law, whether or 
not in force in the Territory. 
190 
Wait-and-see 
 
(1) If a provision of a settlement that creates an interest would, but for 
this section and section 189, infringe the rule against perpetuities, 
the interest is treated until the time (if any) it becomes certain that it 
must vest (if at all) after the end of the perpetuity period as if the 
provision did not infringe the rule and it becoming certain that it 
does infringe the rule does not affect the validity of a thing 
previously done in relation to the interest. 
 
(2) No limitation in a provision of a settlement that creates a contingent 
interest is to be treated as or declared to be invalid because it 
infringes the rule against perpetuities by reason only of there being 
a possibility of the interest vesting after the end of the perpetuity 
period. 
 
(3) Every contingent interest in a provision of a settlement capable of 
vesting before or after the end of the perpetuity period is to be 
presumed valid until events establish that the interest is incapable 
of vesting: 
(a) 
before the end of the perpetuity period, in which case the 
interest is to be treated as or declared to be void; or 
(b) 
after the end of the perpetuity period, in which case the 
interest is to be treated as or declared to be valid. 
 
(4) This section does not affect the operation of section 197.

Part 11 
Perpetuities 
 
 
Law of Property Act 2000 
122 
 
191 
Reduction of age and exclusion of class members 
 
(1) If: 
(a) 
a provision of a settlement creates an interest and the vesting 
of the interest depends on a person attaining a specified age; 
and 
(b) 
it becomes apparent that the provision would not infringe the 
rule against perpetuities if the specified age had been a lesser 
age, 
the interest is, for all purposes, treated as if, instead of its vesting 
depending on the person attaining the specified age, its vesting 
depended on the person attaining the greatest age that, if 
substituted in place of the specified age, would save the provision 
from infringing the rule. 
 
(2) If an interest to which subsection (1) applies is subsequent to any 
other interest created by the settlement, the other interest is not 
defeated or otherwise adversely affected by the operation of 
subsection (1). 
 
(3) If, in relation to an interest created by a provision of a settlement, 
different ages are specified in relation to different persons: 
(a) 
the reference in subsection (1) to the specified age is 
construed as a reference to all the specified ages; and 
(b) 
subsection (1) operates to reduce each age specified so far as 
is necessary to save the provision from infringing the rule 
against perpetuities. 
 
(4) If a provision of a settlement creates an interest which is to be 
taken by members of a class and it becomes apparent that the 
inclusion of a particular member of the class or an unborn person 
(who at birth would become a member or potential member of the 
class) would, but for this subsection: 
(a) 
cause the provision to infringe the rule against perpetuities; or 
(b) 
prevent subsection (1) from operating to save the provision 
from infringing the rule, 
the person is, unless the exclusion of the person would exhaust the 
class, treated in relation to the interest as if the person were not a 
member of the class and, if subsection (1) applies, that subsection 
has effect accordingly. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Part 11 
Perpetuities 
 
 
Law of Property Act 2000 
123 
 
 
(5) If this section has effect in relation to a provision to which 
section 190 applies, the operation of this section does not affect the 
validity of a thing previously done in relation to the interest created 
by the provision. 
192 
Order of application of remedial provisions 
For the purposes of the rule against perpetuities, the following 
provisions are to be applied in the following order: 
(a) 
section 190; 
(b)

(c) 
section 191(4). 
193

other than a power to appoint, pay, transfer, advance, apply, 
distribute or otherwise deal with trust property in or towards 
satisfaction of the interest of a beneficiary under the trust or in or 
towards satisfaction of a purpose of the trust. 
 
(2) The rule against perpetuities does not invalidate an administrative 
power in relation to trust property during the subsistence of a 
beneficial interest in the trust property. 
 
(3) This section applies to an administrative power that takes effect or 
is exercised before or after the commencement of this Act. 
194

provision for remunerating a trustee for the trustee's services. 
 
(2) This section applies to a power or other provision for remunerating 
a trustee taking effect before or after the commencement of this 
Act.

Law of Property Act 2000 
124 
 
fund means: 
(a) 
a provident, superannuation, retirement, sickness, accident, 
assurance, unemployment, pension or co-operative benefit 
fund, scheme, arrangement or provision; or 
(b) 
a fund, scheme, arrangement or provision for the education of

self-employed persons; 
(c) 
spouses, children, grandchildren, parents, dependants or legal 
personal representatives of employees or self-employed 
persons; or 
(d) 
persons duly selected or nominated for that purpose by 
employees or self-employed persons in pursuance of the 
provisions of the settlement. 
 
(3) The rule against perpetuities does not invalidate a trust established 
by a settlement and used for investing the assets of a fund referred 
to in subsection (2) (whether or not it is also used for investing other 
assets). 
 
(4) Subsection (3) does not affect the generality of subsection (2). 
 
(5) This section applies to settlements taking effect before or after 
1 August 1994. 
196 
Determinable interests 
 
(1) In this section: 
determinable interest means an interest created by a settlement 
that is determinable on a contingency provided for in a provision of 
the settlement. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Part 11 
Perpetuities 
 
 
Law of Property Act 2000 
125 
 
subsequent interest, in relation to a determinable interest, means 
an interest, whether vested or contingent: 
(a) 
created by the settlement that created the determinable 
interest or remaining undisposed of by the settlement or taking 
effect by way of reverter, resulting trust, residuary gift or 
otherwise on a possibility arising under the settlement; and 
(b) 
in relation to which the determinable interest is a prior interest. 
 
(2) The rule against perpetuities applies to render invalid the provision 
of a settlement providing for determination of a determinable 
interest in the same manner as the rule would apply to render 
invalid a condition subsequent in the settlement for defeasance of 
the determinable interest on the same contingency. 
 
(3) If the rule applies to a determinable interest: 
(a) 
the determinable interest is not determinable; and 
(b) 
a subsequent interest not itself rendered invalid by the rule 
shall be postponed or defeated to the extent necessary to 
allow the determinable interest to have effect free from the 
provision for determination. 
 
(4) For the purposes of this section, an interest created by, or a 
provision in, an appointment or other exercise of a power in a 
settlement (except a general power of appointment) is not to be 
treated as an interest created by, or a provision in the settlement. 
 
(5) Notwithstanding subsection (2), the rule against perpetuities does 
not apply to a gift over from one charity to another. 
197 
Options 
The rule against perpetuities does not apply to: 
(a) 
an option to renew a lease of property; or 
(b) 
an option or right of pre-emption of a lessee to acquire a 
reversionary interest in property comprised in a lease. 
198 
Trusts for purposes that are not charitable 
 
(1) Subject to this section, this Act does not affect the operation of the 
rule against perpetual trusts for a purpose. 
 
(2) For the purposes of the rule against perpetual trusts, if there is a 
disposition for a purpose by a settlement, the perpetuity period 
applicable to the disposition is a life in being plus 21 years or 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Part 11 
Perpetuities 
 
 
Law of Property Act 2000 
126 
 
80 years from the date on which the settlement takes effect, 
whichever is specified in the settlement. 
 
(3) Despite subsection (2), if no perpetuity period is specified in the 
settlement, the perpetuity period is to be taken to be 80 years from 
the date on which the settlement takes effect. 
 
(4) If there is a disposition for a purpose by a settlement and the 
disposition would, but for this Act, infringe the rule against perpetual 
trusts, the disposition is to be treated, until that time (if any) that it 
becomes certain that the disposition must infringe the rule, as if it 
did not infringe the rule and the validity of a thing previously done in 
relation to the disposition is not affected by it becoming certain that 
it must infringe the rule. 
 
(5) This section does not apply to a disposition for a purpose that is 
charitable. 
199 
Dependent interests 
 
(1) If a provision of a settlement creates an interest, the provision is not 
rendered invalid by the rule against perpetuities or the rule against 
perpetual trusts by reason only that the interest is subsequent to 
and dependent on an interest that is rendered invalid. 
 
(2) If a provision of a settlement creates an interest that is subsequent 
to another interest and the other interest is rendered invalid by the 
rule against perpetuities or the rule against perpetual trusts, the 
acceleration of the vesting of the subsequent interest is not affected 
by reason only that the other interest is invalid. 
200 
Mitigation of rule of remorseless construction 
 
(1) If a court construes a will or other instrument that makes a 
disposition of property, the court may have regard to the fact that 
under one possible construction the disposition would or might be 
void by virtue of the rule against perpetuities but under another 
possible construction it would or might be valid. 
 
(2) In considering which of those constructions is to be preferred, the 
court may take into account that the testator would probably have 
intended the construction under which the disposition would be 
valid. 
 
(3) In the application of this section a court must not: 
(a) 
render a trustee or other person liable for an act done before 
the commencement of this Act for which the trustee or person 
would not have been liable if this Act had not come into 
operation; or

(a) 
property settled or disposed of for a purpose that is charitable; 
(b) 
the power of a person to terminate an accumulation that is for 
his or her benefit; 
(c) 
the jurisdiction or power of the Supreme Court to maintain or 
advance out of accumulations; or

disposition. 
Part 12 
Powers of appointment 
203 
Application of Part 
This Part applies to powers of appointment created or arising 
before and after the commencement of this Act. 
204 
Mode of exercise of powers 
 
(1) If a power of appointment by an instrument other than a will is 
exercised by deed, executed and attested under this Act, or, in the 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Part 12 
Powers of appointment 
 
 
Law of Property Act 2000 
128 
 
case of an instrument under the Land Title Act 2000, under that Act, 
the deed or instrument is, in respect of the execution and 
attestation of the instrument, a valid exercise of the power 
notwithstanding that some additional or other form of execution or 
attestation or solemnity is required by the instrument creating the 
power. 
 
(2) This section does not operate to defeat a direction in an instrument 
creating a power of appointment that: 
(a) 
the consent of a particular person is necessary for there to be 
a valid execution of the instrument by which the power is 
exercised; or 
(b) 
in order to give validity to an appointment, an act is to be 
performed having no relation to the mode of executing and 
attesting the instrument. 
 
(3) This section does not prevent the donee of a power of appointment 
from exercising the power by writing or other than by an instrument 
executed and attested as a deed, and if the power of appointment 
is exercised in that manner this section does not apply. 
205 
Validation of appointments if objects are excluded or take 
illusory shares 
 
(1) An appointment that is made pursuant to the exercise of a power to 
appoint property among 2 or more objects is not invalid on the 
ground that:
