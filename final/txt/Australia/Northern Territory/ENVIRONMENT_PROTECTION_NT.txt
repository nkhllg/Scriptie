Principles of ecologically sustainable development 
 
(1) This Division sets out the principles of ecologically sustainable 
development. 
 
(2) A decision-maker must consider and apply these principles in 
making a decision under this Act.

(3) In making a decision under this Act and stating the reasons for that 
decision, a decision-maker is not required to specify how the 
decision-maker has considered or applied these principles. 
18 
Decision-making principle 
 
(1) Decision-making processes should effectively integrate both 
long-term 
and 
short-term 
environmental 
and 
equitable 
considerations. 
 
(2) Decision-making 
processes 
should 
provide 
for 
community 
involvement in relation to decisions and actions that affect the 
community. 
Note for section 18 
See section 6, definition environment. 
18A 
Principle of proportionality 
Decision-making processes should ensure that decisions or actions 
directed at minimising harm or a risk of harm or impact to the 
environment are proportionate to the harm or risk of harm or impact 
that is being addressed. 
19 
Precautionary principle 
 
(1) If there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage, 
lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reason for 
postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation. 
 
(2) Decision-making should be guided by: 
(a) 
a careful evaluation to avoid serious or irreversible damage to 
the environment wherever practicable; and 
(b) 
an assessment of the risk-weighted consequences of various 
options. 
20 
Principle of evidence-based decision-making 
Decisions should be based on the best available evidence in the 
circumstances that is relevant and reliable. 
21 
Principle of intergenerational and intragenerational equity 
The present generation should ensure that the health, diversity and 
productivity of the environment is maintained or enhanced for the 
benefit of present and future generations.

Principle of sustainable use 
Natural resources should be used in a manner that is sustainable, 
prudent, rational, wise and appropriate. 
23 
Principle of conservation of biological diversity and ecological 
integrity 
Biological diversity and ecological integrity should be conserved 
and maintained. 
24 
Principle of improved valuation, pricing and incentive 
mechanisms 
 
(1) Environmental factors should be included in the valuation of assets 
and services. 
 
(2) Persons who generate pollution and waste should bear the cost of 
containment, avoidance and abatement. 
 
(3) Users of goods and services should pay prices based on the full life 
cycle costs of providing the goods and services, including costs 
relating to the use of natural resources and the ultimate disposal of 
wastes. 
 
(4) Established environmental goals should be pursued in the most 
cost-effective way by establishing incentive structures, including 
market mechanisms, which enable persons best placed to 
maximise benefits or minimise costs to develop solutions and 
responses to environmental problems. 
Division 2 
Management hierarchies 
25 
Hierarchies 
This Division sets out hierarchies for environmental decision-
making and waste management. 
26

ensure that actions are designed to avoid adverse impacts on 
the environment; 
(b) 
identify management options to mitigate adverse impacts on 
the environment to the greatest extent practicable;

Part 3 
Environment protection declarations 
Division 1 
Declaration of environmental objectives and referral triggers

(c) 
if appropriate, provide for environmental offsets in accordance 
with this Act for residual adverse impacts on the environment 
that cannot be avoided or mitigated. 
 
(2) In making decisions in relation to actions that affect the 
environment, decision-makers, proponents and approval holders

(1) In designing, implementing and managing an action, all reasonable 
and practicable measures should be taken to minimise the

Specified environmental offences 
 
Environment Protection Act 2019

Division 2 
Specified environmental offences 
270 
Principles to be applied in imposing penalty for specified 
environmental offences 
When imposing a penalty on a person (the offender) for a specified 
environmental offence, the court must consider the following to the 
extent that they are relevant: 
(a) 
any benefit or likely benefit obtained by the offender in 
committing the offence and the desirability of fixing a penalty 
that outweighs the benefit or potential benefit of the conduct; 
(b) 
the extent of the environmental harm caused, including 
whether the harm is long-term, irreversible or cumulative; 
(c) 
whether there is a need to deter cumulative impacts of 
conduct of this kind by the offender and others; 
(d) 
the extent of any efforts by the offender to minimise or 
remediate the environmental harm; 
(e) 
the extent to which the offender made efforts to comply with 
the environmental approval; 
(f) 
any history of non-compliance by the offender with this Act; 
(g) 
whether there was deliberate concealment of the conduct or of 
the illegal nature of the conduct; 
(h) 
any other matters the court considers relevant. 
271 
Additional court orders where specified environmental offence 
proved 
 
(1) If a person (the offender) is found guilty of a specified 
environmental offence, the court may, having regard to the nature 
of the offence and the circumstances of the offence, make any 
orders it considers appropriate including the following: 
(a) 
an order that the offender must take specified measures within 
a specified time: 
(i) 
to prevent the offence occurring again; or 
(ii) 
to remediate any environmental harm resulting from the 
offence; or 
(iii) to rehabilitate the environment as a result of any 
environmental harm resulting from the offence; or 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Part 11 
Offences, penalties and criminal proceedings 
Division 2 
Specified environmental offences 
 
Environment Protection Act 2019 
236 
 
(iv) to enhance the environment in an area for public benefit; 
(b) 
an order requiring the offender to compensate the CEO for the 
costs of taking any remedial or preventive action that was 
made necessary as a result of the act or omission that 
constituted the offence; 
(c) 
an order directing the offender to pay to the CEO an amount 
that the court estimates will not exceed the financial, monetary 
or economic benefit that the offender or a person associated 
with the offender has gained or can reasonably be expected to 
gain as a result of the commission of the offence; 
(d) 
an order directing the offender to pay an amount in 
compensation to any person who has suffered loss or damage 
as a result of the commission of the offence; 
(e) 
an order requiring the offender to publicise the offence and the 
environmental consequences in a specified manner. 
 
(2) An order under this section is in addition to any other order that the 
court may make under this Act or the Sentencing Act 1995. 
272 
CEO may take measures if order not complied with 
 
(1) If the offender fails to take any measures specified by an order 
under section 271(1)(a), the CEO may take those measures. 
 
(2) The CEO may recover the reasonable costs of taking any 
measures under subsection (1) in a court of competent jurisdiction 
as a debt due to the Territory. 
 
(3) A debt mentioned in subsection (2) may be recorded under the 
Land Title Act 2000 as a charge on any land owned by the offender. 
 
(4) The CEO may, in writing, authorise another person to exercise a 
power or perform a function under subsection (1) or (2) on the 
CEO's behalf. 
 
(5) If a person is authorised to exercise a power or perform a function 
under subsection (4), anything done by the person in the exercise 
of the power or the performance of the function has the same effect 
as if it had been done by the CEO.
