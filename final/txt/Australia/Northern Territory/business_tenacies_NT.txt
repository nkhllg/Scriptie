When lease is entered into 
 
(1) For this Act, a retail shop lease is taken to have been entered into 
when a person: 
(a) 
enters into possession of the retail shop as tenant under the 
lease; or 
(b) 
begins to pay rent as tenant under the lease;  
whichever happens first.  
 
(2) Despite subsection (1), if both parties execute the retail shop lease 
before the tenant enters into possession under the lease or begins 
to pay rent under the lease, the lease is taken to have been entered 
into as soon as both parties have executed the lease.

Meaning of renewal of lease 
 
(1) A reference in this Act to the renewal of a retail shop lease is a 
reference to the renewal of the lease: 
(a) 
under an option granted under the lease for a further term; or 
(b) 
under an agreement to renew the lease for a further term 
entered into by all the parties to the lease. 
 
(2) If: 
(a) 
after a retail shop lease expires, there is a break in the 
tenant's possession of the retail shop; and 
(b) 
the tenant resumes possession of the retail shop for a further 
term (whether or not on the same terms and conditions as 
under the expired lease); 
the resumption of possession of the retail shop is, for this Act, taken 
not to be a renewal of the expired lease and is instead taken to be 
entering into a new lease.
