of the fee has been waived by the Minister. 
 
(4) Subject to section 89A, compensation is payable to a person whose 
interest in land is acquired under this Part whether or not the

relation to the land proposed to be acquired on the Territory 
and the Minister makes a statement in writing to that effect 
before the acquisition takes place;

the purpose of the acquisition is to provide an infrastructure 
facility within the meaning of section 253 of the Native Title 
Act; or 
(c) 
the acquisition relates solely to land or waters within a town or 
city within the meaning of section 251C of the Native Title Act, 
the representative Aboriginal/Torres Strait Islander body in relation

the Minister from entering into negotiations to acquire the land the 
subject of the proposal by agreement under this Act or otherwise or 
prevent the acquisition of that land by such agreement. 
 
(4) A reference in this section to the modification of a proposal is to be 
read as a reference to a modification that results in either or both of 
the following: 
(a) 
a reduction in the area of land proposed to be acquired; 
(b) 
an alteration to the manner in which it is proposed to deal with 
the land if acquired, but not so as to have a greater impact 
(which, in the case of a proposal to deal with the land in a 
manner that affects native title rights and interests, means a 
greater impact or affect on native title) than the manner in 
which it was originally proposed to deal with the land.

Consideration of objections 
35A 
Agreement is anticipated and strongly encouraged 
It is anticipated that the parties concerned will only have recourse to 
the provisions of this Act relating to the procedure for dealing with 
an objection to a proposal or determining compensation payable for 
the acquisition of an interest in acquired land if they are unable to 
resolve those objections by agreement or to reach an agreement 
about that compensation, and the parties concerned are strongly 
encouraged to resolve objections by agreement and to reach 
agreement about compensation; it being noted that the parties may 
enter into one or more agreements relating to the resolution of 
objections, compensation or both and that agreement may be 
reached, in the case of objections, at any time before the Minister 
decides to compulsorily acquire the land and, in the case of 
compensation, at any time before compensation is paid and, in 
either case, as a result of discussions held at any time and whether 
as part of the consultations under section 37 or otherwise than 
under this Act.

subsection (1)(c)(i) a statement in the approved form summarising 
the rights of persons whose land has been acquired under this Act.

has an interest in the land to which it relates. 
50

capable of being assessed, unless the person is a registered native 
title claimant, the Minister must cause to be served on the person: 
(a) 
an offer of compensation that the Minister considers 
appropriate for the acquisition of that person's interest in the 
acquired land; or 
(b) 
an offer of the transfer of land and, if the transfer is instead of 
part only of that compensation, compensation. 
 
(1AA) If the Minister is of the opinion that: 
(a) 
a person specified in section 49(1A)(a) who has been served 
with a notice under section 49(1)(c)(i); or 
(b) 
a person who has lodged a claim for compensation under 
section 52(1) and in relation to whom section 52(2) applies, 
has a claim for compensation under this Act that is not reasonably 
capable of being assessed, unless the person is a registered native

time the Tribunal allows under section 52(1A), the claimant may 
lodge a claim for compensation for the acquisition of the claimant's 
native title rights and interests in relation to the acquired land. 
 
(1AB) Nothing in this section prevents the Minister from making an offer 
other than in accordance with this section to a person with a view to 
reaching agreement about compensation claimed. 
 
(1B) Nothing in subsection (1) or (1A) is to be taken to affect the power 
of the Minister under section 89A to enter into an agreement with a 
registered native title claimant about compensation payable to the 
claimant. 
 
(1C) In the absence of agreement, the compensation that may be 
payable to a person asserting the acquisition of an interest (other 
than a native title right or interest) in the acquired land that is not 
shown on the Register maintained by the Registrar-General under 
the Land Title Act 2000 is not determinable by the Tribunal until it is

established in a court of competent jurisdiction that the person 
holds or, but for the acquisition, would have held the interest 
asserted in the acquired land. 
 
(1D) In the absence of agreement, compensation that may be payable to 
a native title holder or a person who asserts to have had a native 
title right or interest (including a person who held or asserts to have 
held that right or interest on behalf of a group among whose 
members any compensation paid would be distributed but not 
including a registered native title body corporate on whom a copy of 
a notice of acquisition under section 49(1A)(a)(ii) has been served) 
is not determinable by the Tribunal until an approved determination 
of native title to the effect of any of the following has been made: 
(a) 
that the person holds native title; 
(b) 
that native title does not exist but did exist immediately before 
the acquisition and was held by the person; 
(c) 
that native title does not exist and it is apparent from the terms 
of or the reasons for the determination that native title did exist 
immediately before the acquisition and was held by the 
person; 
(d) 
that native title does not exist and it is not apparent from the 
terms of or the reasons for the determination whether native 
title existed immediately before the acquisition. 
Note: 
Were the Federal Court to make a finding that native title does not exist, it is 
anticipated that the Court would make a determination of the kind referred to in 
section 50(1D)(b) or (c) rather than the kind referred to in section 50(1D)(d). 
 
(2) An offer of the transfer of land made under subsection (1)(b): 
(a) 
is, subject to this section, an offer of: 
(i) 
possession of; and 
(ii) 
title to, 
 
land and improvements, if any, specified in the offer which is, 
in the opinion of the Minister, substantially equivalent to the 
land and improvements, if any, acquired under Division 1; 
(b) 
may contain an offer to construct a building or other 
improvements which, in the opinion of the Minister would, 
when completed, be substantially equivalent to the building or 
improvements, as the case may be, on the acquired land; and

this Act comprises native title rights or interests, the person or 
persons who are entitled to compensation may request that the 
compensation should be in a form other than money, and the 
Minister: 
(a) 
must consider the request; and 
(b) 
must negotiate in good faith in relation to the request.

(2) Where a person lodges a claim for compensation under 
subsection (1), the Minister must:

but for the acquisition, would have held the interest asserted in 
the acquired land; or

trustee must: 
(i) 
pay the person so much of the trust amount as equals 
the amount determined; and 
(ii) 
refund the excess to the Territory.

compensation, the trustee must apply to the Supreme Court for a 
direction as to the payment of the trust amount.

to the agreement, being all the native title holders in relation to the 
land the subject of the acquisition, instead of any compensation to 
which those native title holders may be entitled under this Act for

(a) 
must pay the trust amount or part thereof in accordance with 
the agreement to the registered native title claimant; and

Schedule 2 
Rules for the assessment of compensation 
section 66 
1. 
VALUE TO THE OWNER 
Subject to this Schedule, the compensation payable to a claimant 
for compensation in respect of the acquisition of land under this Act 
is the amount that fairly compensates the claimant for the loss he 
has suffered, or will suffer, by reason of the acquisition of the land. 
1A. 
RULES TO EXTEND TO NATIVE TITLE RIGHTS 
AND 
INTERESTS 
To the extent possible, these rules, with the necessary 
modifications, are to be read so as to extend to and in relation to 
native title rights and interests. 
2. 
MARKET 
VALUE, 
SPECIAL 
VALUE, 
SEVERANCE, 
DISTURBANCE 
Subject to this Schedule, in assessing the compensation payable to 
a claimant in respect of acquired land the Tribunal may take into 
account: 
(a) 
the consideration that would have been paid for the land if it 
had been sold on the open market on the date of acquisition 
by a willing but not anxious seller to a willing but not anxious 
buyer; 
(b) 
the value of any additional advantage to the claimant 
incidental to his ownership, or occupation of, the acquired 
land; 
(c) 
the amount of any reduction in the value of other land of the 
claimant caused by its severance from the acquired land by 
the acquisition; and 
(d) 
any loss sustained, or cost incurred, by the claimant as a 
natural and reasonable consequence of: 
(i) 
the acquisition of the land; or 
(ii) 
the service on the claimant of the notice of proposal, 
for which provision is not otherwise made under this Act, other than 
costs incurred as a result of attending, participating in or being 
represented at consultations for the purposes of section 37(1) or 
mediation under section 37(4). 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Schedule 2 
Rules for the assessment of compensation 
 
 
 
Lands Acquisition Act 1978 
58 
 
3. 
MARKET VALUE FOR USE OTHER THAN EXISTING USE 
If the amount referred to in rule 2(a) is determined upon the basis of 
a use for a purpose which is not the purpose for which the land was 
used on the date of acquisition, no amount shall be allowed under 
rule 2(d) in respect of any: 
(a) 
loss that would have been sustained; or 
(b) 
costs that would have been incurred, 
in adapting the land for use for that other purpose. 
4. 
CIRCUMSTANCE PECULIAR TO THE CLAIMANT 
For the purposes of rule 2(d), in determining whether a particular 
loss sustained, or cost incurred, by a claimant is a natural and 
reasonable consequence of: 
(a) 
the acquisition of the land; or 
(b) 
the service on the claimant of the notice of proposal,  
the Tribunal shall take into account any circumstances peculiar to 
the claimant. 
6. 
DETERMINABLE INTERESTS 
If, at the date of acquisition, the interest of the claimant in the land 
was: 
(a) 
due to expire; or 
(b) 
liable to be determined, 
the Tribunal shall take into account any reasonable prospect of 
renewal or continuation of the interest, and the likely terms and 
conditions of that renewal. 
7. 
COST OF ACQUIRING OTHER LAND 
 
(1) If: 
(a) 
the acquired land: 
(i) 
was, immediately before the date of acquisition, used for 
a purpose for which there is no general demand or 
market for land; and 
(ii) 
but for the acquisition, would have continued to have 
been used for that purpose; and 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Schedule 2 
Rules for the assessment of compensation 
 
 
 
Lands Acquisition Act 1978 
59 
 
(b) 
the claimant has acquired, or genuinely intends to acquire, 
other land suitable for that purpose,  
the Tribunal shall take into account, in place of the amount referred 
to in rule 2(a), an amount ascertained by adding: 
(c) 
the cost of acquiring the other land; and 
(d) 
the cost and losses incurred or likely to be incurred by the 
claimant as a result of, or incidental to, relocation, 
in each case calculated at the date when, in all the circumstances, 
it was or would be reasonably practical for the claimant to incur the 
cost or losses. 
 
(2) In assessing the amount of compensation under subrule (1) the 
Tribunal shall have regard to the amount, if any, by which the 
claimant has improved, or is likely to improve, his financial position 
by the relocation. 
8. 
MATTERS NOT TO BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT 
The Tribunal shall not take into account: 
(a) 
any special suitability or adaptability of the acquired land for a 
purpose for which it could only be used: 
(i) 
in pursuance of a power conferred by law; or 
(ii) 
by the Commonwealth or the Territory, a statutory 
corporation 
to 
which 
the 
Financial 
Management 
Act 1995 applies, or a council constituted under the 
Local Government Act 2019; 
(b) 
any increase in value of the acquired land resulting from its 
use or development contrary to law; 
(c) 
any increase or decrease in the amount referred to in rule 2(a) 
arising from: 
(i) 
the carrying out; or 
(ii) 
the proposal to carry out,  
 
the proposal; or 
(d) 
any increase in the value of the land caused by construction, 
after the notice of proposal was served on the claimant, of any 
improvements on the land without the approval of the Minister.

Schedule 2 
Rules for the assessment of compensation 
 
 
 
Lands Acquisition Act 1978

9. 
INTANGIBLE DISADVANTAGES 
 
(1) If the claimant, during the period commencing on the date on which 
the notice of proposal was served and ending on the date of 
acquisition: 
(a) 
occupied the acquired land as his principal place of residence; 
and 
(b) 
held an estate in fee simple, a life estate or a leasehold 
interest in the acquired land, 
the amount of compensation otherwise payable under this 
Schedule may be increased by the amount which the Tribunal 
considers will reasonably compensate the claimant for intangible 
disadvantages resulting from the acquisition. 
 
(2) In assessing the amount payable under subrule (1), the Tribunal 
shall have regard to: 
(a) 
the interest of the claimant in the land; 
(b) 
the length of time during which the claimant resided on the 
land; 
(c) 
the inconvenience likely to be caused to the claimant by 
reason of his removal from the acquired land; 
(d) 
the period after the acquisition of the land during which the 
claimant has been, or will be, allowed to remain in possession 
of the land; 
(e) 
the period during which the claimant would have been likely to 
continue to reside on the land; and 
(f) 
any other matter which is, in the Tribunal's opinion, relevant to 
the circumstances of the claimant.   
10. 
MORTGAGE DEBTS 
The amount of compensation payable to a mortgagee in respect of 
a debt secured by a mortgage over acquired land shall not exceed 
the amount of compensation that would be payable for the 
acquisition of all interests in the land if there had been no mortgage 
secured over that land.

Schedule 2 
Rules for the assessment of compensation 
 
 
 
Lands Acquisition Act 1978 
61 
 
11. 
LOANS 
 
(1) If the amount of compensation assessed in accordance with this 
Schedule is insufficient to enable a claimant who occupied the 
acquired land as his principal place of residence continuously 
between the date of service of the notice of intention and the date 
of acquisition and: 
(a) 
who held an interest in fee simple in the acquired land; 
(b) 
in whom an equity of redemption in respect of that land was 
vested; or 
(c) 
who held a lease of that land granted under an Act: 
(i) 
in perpetuity; 
(ii) 
for a term of not less than 99 years; 
(iii) with a right of purchase; or 
(iv) which contained terms and conditions prohibiting the 
claimant from erecting or using any building on the land 
other than a dwelling-house, 
to purchase land to be used as a principal place of residence 
providing 
accommodation 
reasonably 
comparable 
with 
the 
accommodation on the acquired land, the Minister may offer to 
grant a loan to the claimant of an amount which, when added to the 
amount of compensation otherwise payable in respect of the 
acquired land, would be sufficient to enable the claimant to 
purchase land on which there is accommodation reasonably 
comparable with the accommodation on the acquired land. 
 
(2) The Minister shall, when making an offer under subrule (1), specify 
the maximum amount of the loan he is prepared to grant. 
 
(3) Repayment of a loan granted in accordance with this rule shall be 
secured by a mortgage to the Territory of the land purchased to 
provide the comparable accommodation. 
 
(4) A mortgage under subrule (3): 
(a) 
shall provide for the amount secured to be repayable forthwith 
if: 
(i) 
the land the subject of the mortgage is sold;  
(ii) 
the claimant and his spouse or de facto partner cease to 
use the land as a principal place of residence; or 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Schedule 2 
Rules for the assessment of compensation 
 
 
 
Lands Acquisition Act 1978 
62 
 
(iii) if both the claimant and his spouse or de facto partner 
have died; and 
(b) 
shall contain such other terms and conditions as the Minister 
thinks fit to secure the repayment of the loan. 
12. 
INTERPRETATION 
In rules 9 and 11, a reference to a claimant includes a reference to 
any spouse or de facto partner of the claimant.
