A purchaser of a legal estate from trustees for sale 
shall not be concerned with the trusts affecting the

the same instrument by which the trust for sale is 
created. 
 
35 Powers conferred on trustees for sale 
 
(1) Trustees for sale shall, in relation to land and to 
the proceeds of sale, have all the powers of a

relation to the land the powers of management 
conferred by that Act during a minority,11 and 
(subject to any express trust to the contrary) all 
capital money arising under the said powers shall, 
unless paid or applied for any purpose authorized 
by the Settled Land Act 1958,12 be applicable in 
the same manner as if the money represented 
proceeds of sale arising under the trust for sale. 
All land acquired under this subsection shall be 
conveyed to the trustees on trust for sale. 
The powers conferred by this subsection shall be 
exercised with such consents (if any) as would 
have been required on a sale under the trust for 
sale, and when exercised shall operate to 
overreach any equitable interests or powers which 
attach to the net proceeds of sale. 
 
(2) Subject to any direction to the contrary in the 
disposition on trust for sale or in the settlement of 
the proceeds of sale, the net rents and profits of 
the land until sale, after keeping down costs of 
repairs and insurance and other outgoings shall be 
paid or applied, except so far as any part thereof

applicable if a sale had been made and the 
proceeds had been duly invested. 
 
(3) Where the net proceeds of sale have under the 
trusts affecting the same become absolutely 
vested in persons of full age in undivided shares 
(whether or not such shares may be subject to a 
derivative trust) the trustees for sale may, with the 
consent of the persons (if any) of full age, not 
being annuitants, interested in possession in the 
net rents and profits of the land until sale— 
 
(a) partition the land remaining unsold or any 
part thereof; and 
 
(b) provide (by way of mortgage or otherwise) 
for the payment of any equality money— 
and, upon such partition being arranged, the 
trustees for sale shall give effect thereto by 
conveying the land so partitioned in severalty

raising equality money) to persons of full age 
in accordance with the rights of the persons 
interested under the partition, but a purchaser 
shall not be concerned to see or inquire whether 
any such consent as aforesaid has been given: 
Provided that— 
 
(i) if a share in the net proceeds belongs to a 
lunatic the consent of his committee shall be 
sufficient to protect the trustees for sale; 
 
(ii) if a share in the net proceeds is affected by 
an incumbrance the trustees for sale may 
either give effect thereto or provide for the 
discharge thereof by means of the property

requisition, objection or inquiry, with respect

(a) in the case of an annual sum charged on the 
land, or of a capital sum charged on a 
determinable interest in the land, the sum to 
be paid into court shall be of such amount as, 
when invested in Government securities, the 
Court considers will be sufficient, by means 
of the dividends thereof, to keep down or 
otherwise provide for that charge; and 
 
(b) in any other case of capital money charged 
on the land, the sum to be paid into court 
shall be of an amount sufficient to meet the 
incumbrance and any interest due thereon—

court such additional amount as the Court 
considers will be sufficient to meet the 
contingency of further costs, expenses and 
interest, and any other contingency, except 
depreciation of investments, not exceeding one-
tenth part of the original amount to be paid in,

notwithstanding that on a previous occasion an

(c) that the proposed discharge or modification 
will not substantially injure the persons 
entitled to the benefit of the restriction: 
Provided that no compensation shall be payable in 
respect of the discharge or modification of a 
restriction by reason of any advantage thereby 
accruing to the owner of the land affected by the 
restriction unless the person entitled to the benefit 
of the restriction also suffers loss in consequence 
of the discharge or modification nor shall any 
compensation be payable in excess of such loss; 
but this provision shall not affect any right to 
compensation where the person claiming the 
compensation proves that by reason of the 
imposition of the restriction the amount of 
consideration paid for the acquisition of the land 
was reduced.

subsisting on the thirty-first day of December One

Mortgages 
 
86 Mortgages under Transfer of Land Act 1958 
generally excepted 
Except sections eighty-seven, one hundred and 
two, one hundred and nine, one hundred and ten, 
one hundred and eleven and one hundred and 
twelve, the provisions of this Division shall not 
apply to mortgages under the Transfer of Land 
Act 1958 effected by instruments of mortgage 
under that Act. 
 
87 Foreclosure extinguishes right of action for 
mortgage debt etc. 
 
(1) On a decree judgment or order absolute for 
foreclosure the mortgagee shall be deemed to 
have taken the property mentioned in such decree, 
judgment or order in full satisfaction of the 
mortgage debt and his right or equity to bring 
any action or to take other proceedings for the 
recovery of the mortgage money from the debtor, 
surety or other person shall be extinguished and 
the right or equity of the mortgagor to redeem the 
said property shall also be extinguished. 
 
(2) In the case of mortgages of land under the 
Transfer of Land Act 1958 order absolute 
includes an order for foreclosure under the hand 
of the registrar when recorded on the Register. 
 
(3) Nothing in this section shall be deemed to 
disentitle the mortgagee (on such terms and 
conditions as to the Court seems just) from 
obtaining foreclosure of any other property over 
which he holds security by way of mortgage for 
the said money or part thereof or from enforcing 
all or any rights, powers and remedies expressed 
or implied in such mortgage except the right to

either for the mortgage money or on any bill or 
note given as security for the mortgage money as 
if this section had not been passed. 
 
(4) This section shall have effect notwithstanding any 
stipulation to the contrary. 
 
88 Effect of conveyance on sale by mortgagee by 
sub-demise 
If under a mortgage deed by sub-demise a 
leasehold nominal reversion consisting of a term 
of years absolute or any part of such term is held 
in trust for the mortgagee or would on a sale be 
held in trust for a purchaser from him then on a 
sale by the mortgagee the conveyance (made after 
the thirty-first day of December One thousand 
nine hundred and eighteen) shall operate to 
convey not only the mortgage term but also 
(unless expressly excepted) the aforesaid nominal 
reversion, and the mortgage term and any 
subsequent mortgage term shall subject to any 
express provision to the contrary contained in the 
conveyance merge in the leasehold reversion. 
 
89 When section 88 takes effect 
The last preceding section shall take effect 
without prejudice to any prior incumbrance or 
trust affecting the nominal reversion and shall 
apply whether the mortgage deed was or is 
executed before or after the date aforesaid, but 
shall not apply where the mortgage term does not 
comprise the whole of the land included in the 
leasehold reversion unless the rent (if any) 
payable in respect of that reversion has been 
apportioned as respects the land conveyed or the 
rent is of no money value or no rent is reserved 
and unless the covenants (if any) entered into for 
the benefit of the reversion have been apportioned 
(either expressly or by implication) as respects the 
No. 3754 s. 88.

land conveyed; and in the said section mortgagee 
shall include any person entitled to exercise the 
statutory or other power of sale. 
 
90 Realization of equitable charges by the Court 
 
(1) Where an order for sale is made by the Court in 
reference to an equitable mortgage on land the 
Court may, in favour of a purchaser, make a 
vesting order conveying the land or may appoint a 
person to convey the land, or may create and vest 
in the mortgagee a legal estate in the land to 
enable him to carry out the sale as the case 
requires, in like manner as if the mortgage had 
been made by deed by way of legal mortgage, but 
without prejudice to any incumbrance having 
priority to the equitable mortgage unless the 
incumbrancer consents to the sale. 
 
(2) This section shall apply to equitable mortgages 
made or arising before or after the commencement 
of this Act, but not to a mortgage which has been 
overreached under the powers conferred by this 
Part or otherwise. 
 
91 Sale of mortgaged property in action for redemption 
or foreclosure 
 
(1) Any person entitled to redeem mortgaged property 
may have a judgment or order for sale instead of 
for redemption in an action brought by him either 
for redemption alone, or for sale alone, or for sale 
or redemption in the alternative. 
 
(2) In any action, whether for foreclosure, or for 
redemption, or for sale, or for the raising and 
payment in any manner of mortgage money, the 
Court, on the request of the mortgagee, or of any 
person interested either in the mortgage money or 
in the right of redemption, and, notwithstanding 
that— 
 
(a) any other person dissents; or

(b) the mortgagee or any person so interested 
does not appear in the action— 
and without allowing any time for redemption or 
for payment of any mortgage money, may, if it 
thinks fit, direct a sale of the mortgaged property, 
on such terms as it thinks fit, including the deposit 
in court of a reasonable sum fixed by the Court to 
meet the expenses of sale and to secure 
performance of the terms. 
 
(3) But, in an action brought by a person interested in 
the right of redemption and seeking a sale, the 
Court may, on the application of any defendant, 
direct the plaintiff to give such security for costs 
as the Court thinks fit, and may give the conduct 
of the sale to any defendant, and may give such 
directions as it thinks fit respecting the costs of the 
defendants or any of them. 
 
(4) In any case within this section the Court may, if 
it thinks fit, direct a sale without previously 
determining the priorities of incumbrancers. 
 
(5) This section shall apply to actions brought either 
before or after the commencement of this Act. 
 
(6) In this section mortgaged property shall include 
the estate or interest which a mortgagee would 
have had power to convey if the statutory power 
of sale were applicable. 
 
(7) For the purposes of this section the Court may, 
in favour of a purchaser, make a vesting order 
conveying the mortgaged property, or appoint 
a person to do so, subject or not to any 
incumbrance, as the Court thinks fit; or, in the 
case of an equitable mortgage, may create and 
vest in the mortgagee a legal estate to enable 
him to carry out the sale in like manner as if the 
mortgage had been made by deed by way of legal 
mortgage.

92 Power to authorize land and minerals to be dealt 
with separately 
Where a mortgagee's power of sale in regard to 
land has become exercisable but does not extend 
to the purposes mentioned in this section, the 
Court may, on his application, authorize him and 
the persons deriving title under him to dispose— 
 
(a) of the land, with an exception or reservation 
of all or any mines and minerals, and with or 
without rights and powers of or incidental to 
the working, getting or carrying away of 
minerals; or 
 
(b) of all or any mines and minerals, with or 
without the said rights or powers separately 
from the land— 
and thenceforth the powers so conferred shall 
have effect as if the same were contained in the 
mortgage. 
 
93 Restriction on consolidation of mortgages 
 
(1) A mortgagor seeking to redeem any one mortgage 
shall be entitled to do so without paying any 
money due under any separate mortgage made by 
him, or by any person through whom he claims,

mortgage which he seeks to redeem. 
 
(2) This section shall have effect notwithstanding any 
stipulation to the contrary.

94 Tacking and further advances 
 
(1) After the commencement of this Act, a prior 
mortgagee shall have a right to make further 
advances to rank in priority to subsequent 
mortgages (whether legal or equitable)— 
 
(a) if an arrangement has been made to that 
effect with the subsequent mortgagees; or 
 
(b) if he had no notice of such subsequent 
mortgages at the time when the further 
advance was made by him; or 
 
(c) whether or not he had such notice as 
aforesaid, where the mortgage imposes an 
obligation on him to make such further 
advances. 
This subsection shall apply whether or not the 
prior mortgage was made expressly for securing 
further advances. 
 
(2) In relation to the making of further advances after 
the commencement of this Act a mortgagee shall 
not be deemed to have notice of a mortgage 
merely by reason that it was registered under 
Part I of this Act or any corresponding previous 
enactment, if it was not so registered at the time 
when the original mortgage was created or when 
the last search (if any) by or on behalf of the 
mortgagee was made, whichever last happened. 
This subsection shall apply only where the prior 
mortgage was made expressly for securing a 
current account or other further advances.

(3) The right to tack, save in regard to the making of 
further advances as aforesaid, is hereby declared 
to have been abolished by the Property Law 
Act 1928, section 94(3): 
Provided that nothing in this Part shall affect any 
priority acquired before the commencement of 
that Act by tacking, or in respect of further 
advances made without notice of a subsequent 
incumbrance or by arrangements with the 
subsequent incumbrancer. 
 
(4) This section shall apply to mortgages of land 
made before or after the commencement of this 
Act. 
 
95 Obligation to transfer instead of re-conveying 
 
(1) Where a mortgagor is entitled to redeem, then 
subject to compliance with the terms on 
compliance with which he would be entitled to 
require a re-conveyance or surrender, he shall 
be entitled to require the mortgagee, instead of 
re-conveying or surrendering, to assign the 
mortgage debt and convey the mortgaged property 
to any third person, as the mortgagor directs; and 
the mortgagee shall be bound to assign and 
convey accordingly. 
 
(2) The rights conferred by this section shall belong 
to and shall be capable of being enforced by 
each incumbrancer, or by the mortgagor, 
notwithstanding any intermediate incumbrance; 
but a requisition of an incumbrancer shall prevail 
over a requisition of the mortgagor, and, as 
between incumbrancers, a requisition of a prior 
incumbrancer shall prevail over a requisition of a 
subsequent incumbrancer. 
 
(3) This section shall not apply in the case of a 
mortgagee being or having been in possession.

subsists, shall be entitled from time to time, at 
reasonable times, on his request, and at his own 
cost, and on payment of the mortgagee's costs 
and expenses in this behalf, by himself or his 
legal practitioner to inspect and make copies or 
abstracts of or extracts from the documents of title 
relating to the mortgaged property in the custody 
or power of the mortgagee. 
This section shall have effect notwithstanding any 
stipulations to the contrary. 
 
97 Delivery of documents on extinguishment of 
mortgage 
A mortgagee, whose mortgage is surrendered or 
otherwise extinguished, shall not be liable on 
account of delivering documents of title in his 
possession to the person not having the best right 
thereto, unless he has notice of the right or claim 
of a person having a better right, whether by 
virtue of a right to require a surrender or 
re-conveyance or otherwise. 
 
98 Actions for possession by mortgagors 
 
(1) A mortgagor for the time being entitled to the 
possession or receipt of the rents and profits of 
any land, as to which the mortgagee has not given

enter into the receipt of the rents and profits 
thereof, may sue for such possession, or for the 
recovery of such rents or profits, or to prevent or 
recover damages in respect of any trespass or

other wrong relative thereto, in his own name

made before or after the commencement of 
this Act.

(7) Every such lease shall contain a covenant by the 
lessee for payment of the rent, and a condition of 
re-entry on the rent not being paid within a time 
therein specified not exceeding thirty days. 
 
(8) A counterpart of every such lease shall be 
executed by the lessee and delivered to the lessor, 
of which execution and delivery the execution of 
the lease by the lessor shall, in favour of the lessee 
and all persons deriving title under him, be 
sufficient evidence. 
 
(9) In case of a lease by the mortgagor, he shall, 
within one month after making the lease, deliver 
to the mortgagee, or, where there are more than 
one, to the mortgagee first in priority, a 
counterpart of the lease duly executed by the 
lessee, but the lessee shall not be concerned to see 
that this provision is complied with. 
 
(10) A contract to make or accept a lease under this

reserved or conferred shall be exercisable, as far 
as may be, as if they were conferred by this Part,

and with all the like incidents, effects and 
consequences: 
Provided that the powers so reserved or conferred 
shall not prejudicially affect the rights of any 
mortgagee interested under any other mortgage 
subsisting at the date of the agreement, unless that 
mortgagee joins in or adopts the agreement. 
 
(13) Nothing in this Part shall be construed to enable a 
mortgagor or mortgagee to make a lease for any 
longer term or on any other conditions than such 
as could have been granted or imposed by the 
mortgagor, with the concurrence of all the 
incumbrancers, if this Part and the corresponding 
previous enactments had not been passed: 
Provided that, in the case of a mortgage of 
leasehold land, a lease granted under this section 
shall reserve a reversion of not less than one day. 
 
(14) Subject as aforesaid, this section shall apply to 
any mortgage made after the thirty-first day of 
January One thousand nine hundred and five, but 
the provisions of this section, or any of them, 
may, by agreement in writing made after that date 
between mortgagor and mortgagee, be applied to a 
mortgage made before that date, so nevertheless 
that any such agreement shall not prejudicially 
affect any right or interest of any mortgagee not 
joining in or adopting the agreement. 
 
(15) The provisions of this section referring to a lease 
shall be construed to extend and apply, as far as 
circumstances admit, to any letting, and to an 
agreement, whether in writing or not, for leasing 
or letting. 
 
(16) For the purposes of this section mortgagor shall 
not include an incumbrancer deriving title under 
the original mortgagor.

(17) The powers of leasing conferred by this section

mortgaged property or any part thereof has been

long as the receiver acts, be exercisable by such 
mortgagee instead of by the mortgagor, as 
respects any land affected by the receivership, 
in like manner as if such mortgagee were in 
possession of the land, and the mortgagee may, 
by writing, delegate any of such powers to the 
receiver. 
 
100 Powers of mortgagor and mortgagee in possession to 
accept surrenders of leases 
 
(1) For the purpose only of enabling a lease 
authorized under the last preceding section, or 
under any agreement made pursuant to that 
section, or by the mortgage deed (in this section 
referred to as an authorized lease) to be granted, a 
mortgagor of land while in possession shall, in 
like manner as if the legal estate was vested in 
him and as against every incumbrancer, have, by 
virtue of this Part, power to accept from time to 
time a surrender of any lease of the mortgaged 
land or any part thereof comprised in the lease, 
with or without an exception of or in respect of all 
or any of the mines and minerals therein, and, on a 
surrender of the lease so far as it comprises part 
only of the land or mines and minerals leased, the 
rent may be apportioned. 
 
(2) For the same purpose, a mortgagee of land while 
in possession shall, in like manner as against all 
prior or other incumbrancers (if any) and as 
against the mortgagor, have, by virtue of this Part 
power to accept from time to time any such 
surrender as aforesaid.

(3) On a surrender of part only of the land or mines 
and minerals leased, the original lease may be 
varied, provided that the lease when varied would 
have been valid as an authorized lease if granted 
by the person accepting the surrender; and, on a 
surrender and the making of a new or other lease, 
whether for the same or for any extended or other 
term, and whether subject or not to the same or 
to any other covenants, provisions or conditions, 
the value of the lessee's interest in the lease 
surrendered may, subject to the provisions of this 
section, be taken into account in the determination 
of the amount of the rent to be reserved, and of the 
nature of the covenants, provisions and conditions 
to be inserted in the new or other lease. 
 
(4) Where any consideration for the surrender, other 
than an agreement to accept an authorized lease, 
is given by or on behalf of the lessee to or on 
behalf of the person accepting the surrender, 
nothing in this section shall authorize a surrender 
to a mortgagor without the consent of the 
incumbrancers, or shall authorize a surrender to a 
second or subsequent incumbrancer without the 
consent of every prior incumbrancer. 
 
(5) No surrender shall, by virtue of this section, be 
rendered valid unless— 
 
(a) an authorized lease is granted of the whole of 
the land or mines or minerals comprised in 
the surrender to take effect in possession 
immediately or within one month after the 
date of the surrender; and 
 
(b) the term certain or other interest granted by 
the new lease is not less in duration than the 
unexpired term or interest which would have 
been subsisting under the original lease if 
that lease had not been surrendered; and

(c) where the whole of the land, mines and 
minerals originally leased has been

lease is not less than the rent which would

if it had not been surrendered; or where part 
only of the land or mines and minerals has 
been surrendered, the aggregate rents 
respectively remaining payable or reserved 
under the original lease and new lease are 
not less than the rent which would have been 
payable under the original lease if no partial 
surrender had been accepted.

to the powers and provisions which at that

redemption or to uses (if any) which 
correspond as nearly as may be with the 
limitations then affecting the equity of 
redemption;

sub-demise as a surrender of the term as 
respects the subject-matter of the mortgage 
so as to merge in the reversion immediately 
expectant on that term; 
 
(c) in the case of other property as a 
re-assignment thereof to the extent of the 
interest which is the subject-matter of the 
mortgage to the person who immediately 
before the execution of the receipt was 
entitled to the equity of redemption; 
 
(d) and in all cases as a discharge of the

of that Act without any re-conveyance, and 
operates as a discharge of the mortgaged or 
charged property from all principal moneys and 
interest secured by, and all claims under, the 
mortgage or charge. 
 
(2) Provided that (except as hereinafter mentioned) 
where by the receipt the money appears to have 
been paid by a person who is not entitled to the 
immediate equity of redemption then unless it is 
otherwise expressly provided the receipt shall 
operate as if the benefit of the mortgage had by 
deed been transferred to him; but this provision 
shall not apply where the mortgage is paid off 
out of capital money or other money in the hands 
of a personal representative or trustee properly 
applicable for the discharge of the mortgage

to operate as a transfer. 
 
(3) Nothing in this section shall confer on a

off by him so as to affect prejudicially any 
subsequent incumbrancer, and where there is no 
right to keep the mortgage alive the receipt shall 
not operate as a transfer.

person to require a re-conveyance, re-assignment, 
surrender, release or transfer to be executed in lieu 
of a receipt.

executes the receipt had by deed been expressed 
to convey the property as mortgagee subject to 
any interest which is paramount to the mortgage.

assignment by the grantee, transferee or assignee. 
 
139 Effect of extinguishment or reversion 
 
(1) Where a reversion expectant on a lease of land is 
surrendered or merged, the estate or interest which 
as against the lessee for the time being confers the 
next vested right to the land, shall be deemed the 
reversion for the purpose of preserving the same 
incidents and obligations as would have affected 
the original reversion had there been no surrender 
or merger thereof. 
 
(2) This section shall apply to surrenders or mergers 
effected after the first day of June One thousand 
eight hundred and sixty-four.

surrender or otherwise of the reversionary estate 
in any land comprised in a lease, and 
notwithstanding the avoidance or cesser in any 
other manner of the term granted by a lease as to 
part only of the land comprised therein, every 
condition or right of re-entry, and every other 
condition contained in the lease, shall be 
apportioned, and shall remain annexed to the 
severed parts of the reversionary estate as severed, 
and shall be in force with respect to the term

land as to which the term remains subsisting, as 
the case may be, had alone originally been

(2) In this section right of re-entry includes a right to 
determine the lease by notice to quit or otherwise; 
but where the notice is served by a person entitled 
to a severed part of the reversion so that it extends 
to part only of the land demised, the lessee may 
within one month determine the lease in regard to 
the rest of the land by giving to the owner of the 
reversionary estate therein a counter notice 
expiring at the same time as the original notice. 
 
(3) This section shall apply to leases made before or 
after the commencement of this Act and whether 
the severance of the reversionary estate or the 
partial avoidance or cesser of the term was

require, of the land leased. 
 
(3) Where that person becomes entitled by 
conveyance or otherwise, such rent, covenant or 
provision may be recovered, received, enforced or 
taken advantage of by him notwithstanding that he

or forfeiture has become enforceable, but this 
subsection shall not render enforceable any 
condition of re-entry or other condition waived or 
released before such person becomes entitled as 
aforesaid.

severance of the reversionary estate was effected 
before or after such commencement: 
Provided that, where the lease was made before

(2) Notwithstanding any such licence— 
 
(a) all rights under covenants and powers of

(b) the condition or right of entry shall remain in

matter authorized to be done. 
 
(3) Where in any lease there is a power or condition 
of re-entry on the lessee assigning, subletting or 
doing any other specified act without a licence,

condition by the co-lessees of the other shares or 
interests in the property, or by the lessee or lessees 
of the rest of the property (as the case may be) in 
respect of such shares or interests or remaining 
property, but the right of entry shall remain in 
force in respect of the shares, interests or property 
not the subject of the licence.

such covenant, condition or agreement shall 
unless the lease contains an express provision to

to the effect that such consent shall not be 
unreasonably withheld and that no fine or sum of 
money in the nature of a fine shall be payable for

146 Restrictions and relief against forfeiture of leases

(1) A right of re-entry or forfeiture under any proviso 
or stipulation in a lease or otherwise arising by 
operation of law for a breach of any covenant or 
condition in the lease, including a breach 
amounting to repudiation, shall not be 
enforceable, by action or otherwise, unless and

of; and 
 
(b) if the breach is capable of remedy, requiring 
the lessee to remedy the breach; and 
 
(c) in any case, requiring the lessee to make 
compensation in money for the breach— 
and the lessee fails, within a reasonable time 
thereafter, or the time not being less than fourteen 
days fixed by the lease to remedy the breach, if it 
is capable of remedy, and to make reasonable 
compensation in money, to the satisfaction of the 
lessor, for the breach.

whereof either alone or with other circumstances 
any licence or permit under the Liquor Control 
Reform Act 1998 is or may be endangered or is 
or may be liable to expire or be forfeited,

lessor; and 
 
(b) does not affect any right that the lessor may

(2) Where a lessor is proceeding, by action or 
otherwise, to enforce or has enforced without the 
aid of the Court or the County Court such a right 
of re-entry or forfeiture, the lessee may apply to 
the Court for relief; and the Court may grant or 
refuse relief, as the Court, having regard to the 
proceedings and conduct of the parties under the 
foregoing provisions of this section, and to all the 
other circumstances thinks fit; and in case of relief 
may grant it on such terms (if any) as to costs,

forfeiture unenforceable against him under that 
subsection. 
 
(4) Where a lessor is proceeding by action or 
otherwise to enforce or has enforced a right of 
re-entry or forfeiture under any covenant, proviso 
or stipulation in a lease, or otherwise arising by 
operation of law, or for non-payment of rent, or 
for any breach amounting to repudiation which 
the lessor has accepted as such, the Court may, 
on application by any person claiming as 
under-lessee any estate or interest in the property 
comprised in the lease or any part thereof, make 
an order vesting, for the whole term of the lease 
or any less term, the property comprised in the 
lease or any part thereof in any person entitled as 
under-lessee to any estate or interest in such 
property upon such conditions as to execution of 
any deed or other document, payment of rent, 
costs, expenses, damages, compensation, giving 
security, or otherwise, as the Court in the 
circumstances of each case may think fit, but in no 
case shall any such under-lessee be entitled to 
require a lease to be granted to him for any longer 
term than he had under his original sub-lease.

breach amounting to repudiation occurs is inserted 
in the lease in pursuance of the directions of any 
Act of Parliament but shall not apply to leases by

the lease, if it was made in good faith, and the 
lessee has entered thereunder, shall take effect in 
equity as a contract for the grant, at the request 
of the lessee, of a valid lease under the power, of

variations as may be necessary in order to comply 
with the terms of the power: 
Provided that a lessee under an invalid lease shall 
not, by virtue of any such implied contract, be 
entitled to obtain a variation of the lease if the 
other persons who would have been bound by the 
contract are willing and able to confirm the lease 
without variation. 
 
(2) Where a lease granted in the intended exercise of

not having power to grant the lease at the date 
thereof, but the grantor's interest in the land 
comprised therein continues after the time when

to confirm the lease, be bound to accept a 
confirmation thereof, and thereupon the lease

acceptance shall, as against that person, be 
deemed to be a confirmation of the lease. 
 
(5) The foregoing provisions of this section shall not 
affect prejudicially— 
 
(a) any right of action or other right or remedy 
to which, but for those provisions the lessee 
named in an invalid lease would or might

the part of the grantor for title or quiet 
enjoyment contained therein or implied 
thereby; or 
 
(b) any right of re-entry or other right or remedy

lessee.

thereof independently of the power, the lease shall

153 Enlargement of residue of long terms into fee-simple 
estates 
 
(1) Where a residue unexpired of not less than two 
hundred years of a term, which, as originally 
created, was for not less than three hundred years, 
is subsisting in land, whether being the whole land 
originally comprised in the term, or part only 
thereof— 
 
(a) without any trust or right of redemption 
affecting the term in favour of the freeholder, 
or other person entitled in reversion 
expectant on the term; and 
 
(b) without any rent, or with merely a 
peppercorn rent or other rent having no 
money value, incident to the reversion, or 
having had a rent, not being merely a 
peppercorn rent or other rent having no 
money value, originally so incident, which 
subsequently has been released or has 
become barred by lapse of time, or has in 
any other way ceased to be payable— 
the term may be enlarged into a fee-simple in the 
manner and subject to the restrictions in this 
section provided.

purposes of this section, be deemed to have ceased 
to be payable: 
Provided that, of the said period, at least five years 
must have elapsed after the commencement of this 
Act. 
 
(5) Where a rent incident to a reversion expectant 
on a term to which this section applies is deemed

aforesaid, no claim for such rent or for any arrears 
thereof shall be capable of being enforced.

term is vested, whether subject to any

shall, so far as regards the land to which he is 
entitled, or in which he is interested in right of the 
term, in any such character as aforesaid, have 
power by deed to declare to the effect that, from 
and after the execution of the deed, the term shall 
be enlarged into a fee-simple. 
 
(7) Such deed shall be duly registered in the office of 
the Registrar-General and thereupon by virtue of 
the deed and of this Part, the term shall become 
and be enlarged accordingly, and the person in 
whom the term was previously vested shall 
acquire and have in the land a fee-simple instead 
of the term. 
 
(8) The estate in fee-simple so acquired by 
enlargement shall be subject to all the same trusts, 
powers, executory limitations over, rights, and 
equities, and to all the same covenants and 
provisions relating to user and enjoyment, and to 
all the same obligations of every kind, as the term 
would have been subject to if it had not been so 
enlarged.

has been settled in trust by reference to 
other land, being freehold land, so as to go

by a settlement—

256 A voidable estate by a tenant in tail in favour of a 
purchaser 
When a tenant in tail of land under a settlement 
has already created or hereafter creates in such 
land or any part thereof a voidable estate in favour 
of a purchaser for valuable consideration, and 
afterwards under this Part by any assurance other 
than a lease not requiring acknowledgment 
makes a disposition of the land in which such 
voidable estate is created or any part thereof, 
such disposition (whatever its object may be and 
whatever may be the extent of the estate intended 
to be thereby created) shall have the effect of 
confirming such voidable estate in the land 
thereby disposed of to its full extent as against all 
persons except those whose rights are saved by 
this Part: Provided always that if such disposition 
is made to a purchaser for valuable consideration 
who has not express notice of the voidable estate, 
then and in such case the voidable estate shall not 
be confirmed as against such purchaser and the 
persons claiming under him.

force either at law or in equity under this Part 
unless made or evidenced by deed; and that no 
disposition by a tenant in tail resting only in

would not be effectual 
In cases of dispositions of lands under this Part 
by tenants in tail thereof, the jurisdiction of equity 
shall be altogether excluded, either on the behalf 
of a person claiming for a valuable or meritorious 
consideration or not, in regard to the specific 
performance of contracts and the supplying of 
defects in the execution of the powers of 
disposition given by this Part to tenants in tail and 
the supplying under any circumstances of the want 
of execution of such powers of disposition; and in 
regard to giving effect in any other manner to any 
act or deed by a tenant in tail which in a court of 
law would not be an effectual disposition under 
this Part; and no disposition of land under this Part 
by a tenant in tail thereof in equity shall be of any

such order or at any time afterwards before he has 
obtained his discharge or certificate) is a tenant in 
tail, to a purchaser for valuable consideration for 
the benefit of the creditors of such bankrupt tenant 
in tail, and such disposition shall create as large 
an estate in the land disposed of as the tenant in 
tail, if he had not become bankrupt could have 
created or done under this Part by a deed duly 
acknowledged; and no deed by which such trustee

In this Part document of title includes any Crown 
grant or Crown lease or any folio of the Register 
deed of conveyance partition release or assurance 
or other deed will lease written contract or 
writing. 
 
268 Crown survey boundaries as marked on the ground 
to be deemed the true boundaries 
The survey boundaries of any Crown section 
portion allotment or other parcel of land marked 
on the ground at the time of the Crown survey 
thereof, and shown by survey posts pegs trenches 
or other survey marks shall, as to any such parcel 
of land heretofore or hereafter granted or demised 
by the Crown, be and be deemed to have been the 
true boundaries of such parcel of land whether 
such boundaries upon admeasurement are or are 
not found to be of the same dimensions or to 
include the same area as the boundaries or 
description of such parcel given in the Crown 
grant or Crown lease thereof.

plan used in connexion with the alienation by the 
Crown of such parcel of land. 
 
270 As to aliquot parts of Crown sections having excess 
of area 
Where a Crown section has been subdivided by 
the Crown into allotments or portions of equal 
area, and by reason of excessive measurements in 
the original Crown survey the area of the section 
as marked on the ground by the survey boundaries 
exceeds the sum of the areas of all the allotments 
or portions as shown by any plan or description 
used at the Crown sale or as deducible from any 
Crown grant of any such allotment or portion, 
the total excess of area of the section shall be 
deemed originally distributable amongst the 
allotments or portions equally; and every Crown 
grant purporting to be a grant of one of such 
allotments or portions shall where the original 
subdivisional survey boundaries thereof do not 
exist, or if not inconsistent with such boundaries 
where they do exist, be construed to be a grant of 
such aliquot part of the total area included within 
the survey boundaries of such section as is 
obtained by dividing such area by the number of 
original allotments or portions. 
 
271 How Crown survey boundaries may be proved in 
the absence of survey marks 
When the survey marks of any line constituting 
one of the original boundary lines of any Crown 
section allotment or other Crown parcel of land

in some court of competent jurisdiction or 
(where the land is under or is proposed to be 
brought under the Transfer of Land Act 1958)

INTERPRETATION OF LEGISLATION ACT 1984 (ILA) 
Style changes 
Section 54A of the ILA authorises the making of the style changes set out in 
Schedule 1 to that Act. 
References to ILA s. 39B 
Sidenotes which cite ILA s. 39B refer to section 39B of the ILA which 
provides that where an undivided section or clause of a Schedule is amended 
by the insertion of one or more subsections or subclauses, the original section 
or clause becomes subsection or subclause (1) and is amended by the 
insertion of the expression "(1)" at the beginning of the original section or 
clause. 
Interpretation 
As from 1 January 2001, amendments to section 36 of the ILA have the 
following effects: 
• 
Headings 
All headings included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
form part of that Act.  Any heading inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  This includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in 
a Schedule; sections; clauses; items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; 
notes or forms.  See section 36(1A)(2A). 
• 
Examples, diagrams or notes 
All examples, diagrams or notes included in an Act which is passed on or 
after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any examples, diagrams or notes 
inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed 
on or after 1 January 2001, form part of that Act.  See section 36(3A).

• 
Punctuation 
All punctuation included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
forms part of that Act.  Any punctuation inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  See section 36(3B). 
• 
Provision numbers 
All provision numbers included in an Act form part of that Act, whether 
inserted in the Act before, on or after 1 January 2001.  Provision numbers 
include section numbers, subsection numbers, paragraphs and subparagraphs.  
See section 36(3C). 
• 
Location of "legislative items" 
A "legislative item" is a penalty, an example or a note.  As from 13 October 
2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of an Act is taken to be at the 
foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another legislative 
item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a penalty at the foot of a 
provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items will be 
regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See section 36B. 
• 
Other material 
Any explanatory memorandum, table of provisions, endnotes, index and 
other material printed after the Endnotes does not form part of an Act.   
See section 36(3)(3D)(3E).
