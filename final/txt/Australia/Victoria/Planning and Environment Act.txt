Example 
For the purposes of determining the maximum 
dwelling amount— 
• 
for the financial year beginning on 1 July 2019, 
"PMDA" is the maximum dwelling amount for 
the financial year beginning on 1 July 2018, 
which is $1150—see section 46L(3)(a); and 
• 
for the financial year beginning on 1 July 2020, 
"PMDA" is the maximum dwelling amount for 
the financial year beginning on 1 July 2019, 
which is the adjusted maximum dwelling amount 
calculated in accordance with this section for 
that financial year—see section 46L(3)(b). 
 
A is the sum of the producer price index 
numbers for— 
 
(a) the last reference period in the financial 
year 2 years earlier than the financial 
year in respect of which the adjusted 
maximum dwelling amount is being 
determined; and 
 
(b) each of the reference periods 
(other than the last) in the financial 
year immediately preceding the 
financial year in respect of which the 
adjusted maximum dwelling amount is 
being determined; 
 
B is the sum of the producer price index 
numbers for— 
 
(a) the last reference period in the financial 
year 3 years earlier than the financial 
year in respect of which the adjusted 
maximum dwelling amount is being 
determined; and

Example 
In the case that the reference periods are the quarterly 
periods of a financial year, the variables "A" and "B" 
for the determination of the adjusted maximum 
dwelling amount for the financial year beginning on 
1 July 2020 are as follows— 
• 
"A" is the sum of the producer price 
index numbers for the June quarter in the 
financial year beginning on 1 July 2018 and the 
September, December and March quarters in the 
financial year beginning on 1 July 2019;  
• 
"B" is the sum of the producer price 
index numbers for the June quarter in the

application may have a substantial effect on 
the achievement or development of planning 
objectives; or 
 
(b) that the decision on the application has been 
unreasonably delayed to the disadvantage of 
the applicant; or

the officer, an officer of a body corporate may

the officer bears the same burden of proof that the 
body corporate would bear.

notice informs the responsible authority that those 
steps have been taken, an authorised officer of the 
authority must, without delay, find out whether or 
not those steps have been taken, and serve on the 
person a notice stating whether or not those steps 
have been taken. 
 
(6) A statement in a notice under subsection (5) that 
additional steps have been taken is for all 
purposes conclusive proof of that fact.

(2) In this section— 
acquire in relation to an interest in a landholder 
has the same meaning as in section 80 of the 
Duties Act 2000; 
 
interest in relation to a landholder has the same 
meaning as in section 79(1) of the Duties 
Act 2000; 
 
relevant acquisition means a relevant acquisition 
within the meaning of section 78 (other than 
subsection (1)(b)), 81 or 82 of the Duties 
Act 2000 in respect of which duty is 
chargeable under Part 2 of Chapter 3 of that 
Act and which is not an exempt acquisition 
within the meaning of that Part. 
Examples 
1 
B acquires a 60% interest in company XYZ Pty Ltd, which 
is a private landholder that owns land subject to GAIC.  
This acquisition is a relevant acquisition under 
section 78(1)(a)(i) of the Duties Act 2000 and is a significant 
acquisition.  B would be liable to pay 60% of the GAIC 
imposed in respect of the land subject to GAIC owned 
by XYZ.  If C, after that significant acquisition, were to 
acquire 10% of the remaining interest in XYZ, C would be 
liable to pay 10% of the GAIC (indexed if applicable) 
imposed in respect of the land subject to GAIC owned by 
XYZ.  Any further acquisitions of the remaining 30% interest 
in XYZ would also attract the imposition of GAIC in 
proportion to the interest acquired. 
2 
RST Pty Ltd is a company that is a public landholder.  In 
October 2012, Y acquires a 70% interest in RST.  This is not 
a significant acquisition.  In 2017, T obtains a 25% interest in 
RST.  As Y and T are associated persons there has now been 
a significant acquisition made up of 95% of the interest in 
RST, therefore Y and T are jointly and severally liable to pay 
95% of the indexed amount of GAIC payable in relation to 
land subject to GAIC owned by RST.

Division 2—Imposition of growth areas

Subdivision 1—Liability for GAIC 
 201S Imposition of growth areas infrastructure 
contribution 
 
 
(1) Subject to this section and section 201SA, a 
growth areas infrastructure contribution is 
imposed in respect of the first GAIC event to 
occur in relation to any land in the contribution 
area unless the person liable to pay the 
contribution is exempted from that liability, in 
which case a growth areas infrastructure 
contribution is imposed in respect of the next 
GAIC event that occurs in relation to that land. 
Note 
Exemptions and reductions of liability to pay growth areas 
infrastructure contributions are set out in Division 3. 
 
(2) Subject to this section and section 201SLA, a 
growth areas infrastructure contribution may be 
imposed once only in respect of any land in the 
contribution area. 
 
(3) Where a dutiable transaction relating to land in the 
contribution area has occurred in relation to less 
than the whole of the interest in the land or in a 
landholder that owns the land and a growth areas 
infrastructure contribution was imposed in respect 
of that transaction, any further GAIC event that 
occurs in relation to a remaining interest in that 
land or landholder is a first GAIC event relating to 
that interest.

Examples 
1 
Where land is jointly owned and one owner transfers his or 
her 30% interest in the land, that transfer will be the first 
GAIC event in relation to that 30% interest in the land.  
The purchaser will be liable to pay 30% of the GAIC payable 
in respect of the land.  If the land is then subdivided, the 
subdivision will be a first GAIC event relating to the 
remaining 70% interest in the land and the remaining 70% of 
the GAIC will be payable in respect of that GAIC event by 
the owners of that 70% interest. 
2 
XYZ Pty Ltd is a private landholder that owns land subject to 
GAIC.  A, B and C each hold respectively 30%, 30% and 
40% interests in XYZ.  D acquires the interests of A and B 
which is a significant acquisition, and is the first GAIC event 
relating to those interests.  D will be liable to pay 60% of the 
GAIC payable in respect of the land.  E then acquires D's 
60% interest in XYZ but as GAIC has already been paid in 
respect of that interest, E is not liable to pay any GAIC on 
the acquisition. XYZ then transfers the land to IPL Pty Ltd.  
This dutiable transaction relating to land is a first GAIC event 
relating to the remaining interest in XYZ, and IPL will be 
liable to pay the remaining 40% of the GAIC (as indexed if 
applicable) payable in respect of the land. 
 
(4) If the first GAIC event that occurs in relation to 
any land in the contribution area is the issue of a 
statement of compliance relating to a plan of 
subdivision of land and the sole purpose of the 
plan of subdivision of land is to provide for public 
purpose land— 
 
(a) the growth areas infrastructure contribution 
is not imposed in respect of that GAIC event 
to the extent that the plan of subdivision of 
land relates to any part of the land that is not 
public purpose land (the balance land); and 
 
(b) the next GAIC event that occurs in relation 
to any part of the balance land is a first 
GAIC event for the purposes of this section.

Example 
The owner of land in the contribution area applies to 
subdivide the land for the sole purpose of providing for the 
construction of a road. The issue of the statement of 
compliance relating to the plan of subdivision of land is a 
first GAIC event to the extent that the plan relates to public 
purpose land. A GAIC is imposed under subsection (1) and 
is payable under section 201SL within 3 months after the 
date of issue of the statement of compliance. The amount of 
the GAIC is calculated under section 201SG by reference to 
the area of the public purpose land. A GAIC is not imposed 
under subsection (1) on the issue of the statement of 
compliance to the extent that the plan of subdivision relates 
to the balance land. A GAIC will be imposed on the next 
GAIC event that occurs in relation to any part of the balance 
land.

of a lot (the other part of the lot not 
being in the contribution area) and that 
part of the lot has a total lot area of 
between 0·41 hectares and 10 hectares; 
and 
 
(ii) immediately before the commencement 
day had a habitable dwelling on it; or 
 
(b) any land or part of any land that is the

(2) In calculating the amount of growth areas 
infrastructure contribution under subsection (1) 
the area of land in hectares will be rounded off to 
the fifth decimal point. 
Example 
If the area of the land is 93·675897 hectares, the growth 
areas infrastructure contribution will be calculated on 
93·67590 hectares. 
 
(3) Subject to section 201SI, the amount of the 
growth areas infrastructure contribution that is 
payable in the 2010/2011 financial year is— 
 
(a) for type A land—$80 000 per hectare; 
 
(b) for type B-1 land or type B-2 land—$95 000 
per hectare; 
 
(c) for type C land—$95 000 per hectare. 
Examples 
1 
A person sells a parcel of land in October 2010 that has 
a total area of 10 hectares consisting of 3 lots of land 
on separate titles.  Lot 1 is 3 hectares in area and is not 
in the contribution area and lot 2 is 3 hectares in area 
and is in the contribution area but GAIC does not apply 
to that land under section 201SA because it is subject 
to a registered restrictive covenant that prohibits 
subdivision.  However lot 3 is 4 hectares in area and is 
type A land.  In this case the purchaser will be liable to 
pay a GAIC of $320 000 in relation to the lot 3 land 
only. 
2 
A person who co-owns a 5 hectare lot of type A land as 
a tenant in common sells his or her 20% interest in the 
land in October 2010.  The purchaser of the land will 
be liable to pay a GAIC of $80 000.  If any of the 
co-owners, who hold the remaining 80% interest in the 
land, disposes of his or her interest in the land, the 
relevant purchaser will be liable to pay the GAIC 
(indexed if applicable) in proportion to that interest.

A person obtains a 50% interest in a private landholder 
company which owns 2 hectares of type A land 
(a significant acquisition).  The person would be liable 
to pay 50% of the GAIC in respect of the type A land 
based on the relevant contribution rate for that financial 
year.  If the rate was $84 000 per hectare for type A 
land in that year, the amount payable would be 
$84 000. 
 
(4) Subject to section 201SI, the amount of the

(1) A growth areas infrastructure contribution 
imposed in respect of the issue of a statement of 
compliance relating to a plan of subdivision of 
any land in the contribution area (a parent lot) 
must be apportioned between each lot, parcel 
or other area of land referred to in the plan

(6) A person who has deferred the payment of part of 
a growth areas infrastructure contribution under 
this section must pay the part of the contribution

(4) If the subsequent dutiable transaction occurred in 
relation to less than the whole of the interest in the 
land or in a landholder that owns the land— 
 
 
(a) the liability of the subsequent transferee to 
pay the growth areas infrastructure 
contribution will be in proportion to the 
proportion of the interest in the land or 
landholder that was the subject of the 
subsequent dutiable transaction; and 
 
(b) the relevant person remains liable to pay the 
remaining part of that deferred growth areas 
infrastructure contribution. 
Example 
ABC Pty Ltd bought type B land in 2011. The GAIC 
liability for the land was $600,000.  ABC Pty Ltd paid 30% 
GAIC liability ($180,000) and deferred 70% of the liability.  
In 2012, ABC Pty Ltd sold 50% of its interest in the land to 
XYZ Pty Ltd. 
XYZ Pty Ltd is liable to pay 50% of the deferred 70% 
GAIC plus interest and can elect to defer that amount of 
assumed liability.  ABC Pty Ltd's deferral continues in 
respect of the remaining 50% of the deferred 70% GAIC 
plus interest.  There is a charge on the land for the whole 
deferred GAIC plus interest when it comes due. 
The relevant person is relieved of the liability to pay their 
deferred GAIC liability upon occurrence of the subsequent 
dutiable transaction relating to the land. The relief from 
liability can be partial or in full, depending on the extent of 
the disposed interest in the land or landholder by the 
relevant person. 
 
(5) The liability under this section to pay a growth 
areas infrastructure contribution arises from the 
time the subsequent dutiable transaction relating 
to the land occurs.

infrastructure contribution is to be calculated at 
the end of each financial year after the liability to 
pay the contribution arose before the first deferral 
of payment of the contribution under 
section 201SM(1). 
 
(3) The indexation of a deferred amount of growth 
areas infrastructure contribution for the 2011/2012 
financial year and each subsequent financial year 
is calculated in accordance with Part 5 of 
Schedule 1. 
 
(4) The deferred amount of a growth areas 
infrastructure contribution, after indexation, for a 
financial year is the adjusted deferred amount of 
the contribution for that financial year within the 
meaning of Part 5 of Schedule 1.

(b) the making of an application for a building 
permit to carry out building work on all or 
any part of that land. 
 
(2) Subject to sections 201SPAA and 201SS, a 
person who under this Subdivision has deferred 
the whole or part of a growth areas infrastructure 
contribution imposed in respect of a significant 
acquisition of an interest in a landholder must pay 
to the Commissioner that deferred contribution on 
or before the first of the following to occur— 
 
(a) the issue of a statement of compliance 
relating to a plan of subdivision of all or part 
of the land held by the landholder in respect 
of which the liability to pay the deferred 
contribution is imposed; 
 
(b) the making of an application for a building 
permit to carry out building work on all or 
any part of the land held by the landholder in 
respect of which the liability to pay the 
contribution is imposed. 
Example 
RST Pty Ltd is a private landholder that owns land subject 
to GAIC.  X holds 60% of the interest in RST and disposes 
of that interest to Y.  Y has made a significant acquisition 
and is liable to pay 60% of the GAIC payable in respect of 
the land.  Y defers the payment of the GAIC under 
this Subdivision.  RST applies for a building permit to carry 
out work on the land.  Y and RST are jointly and severally 
liable to pay the deferred GAIC together with the interest 
relating to the GAIC on or before the application for the 
building permit is made by RST.  RST is also liable to pay 
40% of the GAIC payable in respect of the land (indexed if 
applicable) arising from the building works.  However, the 
time for paying both GAIC payments does not apply if RST 
applies for approval of the staged payment of the GAIC 
under Subdivision 4.

paid within 3 months after the day on 
which— 
 
(i) the statement of compliance is issued; 
or 
 
(ii) the non-SOC plan of subdivision is 
certified; and 
 
(b) the proportion of the growth areas 
infrastructure contribution that is

contribution (a deferred proportion). 
 
(4) For the purposes of subsection (3)— 
 
(a) a reference in this Subdivision (other than 
section 201SM or 201SP) to a growth areas 
infrastructure contribution that is deferred 
in whole or in part under section 201SM 
includes a reference to a PPL proportion; and 
 
(b) a reference in this Subdivision (other 
than section 201SM) to a growth areas 
infrastructure contribution that is deferred 
in whole or in part under section 201SM 
includes a reference to a deferred proportion. 
Example 
ABC Pty Ltd purchases 15 hectares of land in the contribution 
area in June 2017. The dutiable transaction in relation to the land 
is the first GAIC event in relation to the land and a GAIC is 
imposed. ABC Pty Ltd is liable to pay the GAIC and elects under 
section 201SM to defer 100% of the amount payable. In December 
2017, ABC Pty Ltd applies to subdivide the land for the sole 
purpose of providing 1·5 hectares of land for the construction of a 
road. On the issue of the statement of compliance relating to the 
S. 201SPAA

plan of subdivision of land, the GAIC is apportioned between the 
two child lots based on the area of land each child lot bears to the 
parent lot. Accordingly, 10% of the GAIC is apportioned to the 
public purpose land (the PPL proportion). This amount, as 
indexed under section 201SMA, and any accrued interest on this 
amount is payable within 3 months after the date of the issue of 
the statement of compliance. The remaining 90% is apportioned 
to the balance land (the deferred proportion) and this amount 
continues to be deferred and subject to indexation and interest 
under section 201SMA until the amount becomes payable under 
this Subdivision. 
201SPA Default on payment of deferred GAIC 
If a person does not pay the deferred growth areas 
infrastructure contribution when due for payment 
under section 201SP or 201SPAA, the amount 
of the contribution deferred under section 201SM 
becomes immediately payable as if the election of 
the deferral had never been made. 
Note 
If the deferred growth areas infrastructure contribution, 
including any indexation and interest, is not paid when due under 
section 201SP or 201SPAA, a tax default within the meaning of 
the Taxation Administration Act 1997 will occur in respect of 
payment of the whole of the contribution that the person would 
have had to pay if the person had not deferred part of the 
contribution. Under Part 5 of that Act, the person will then be 
liable to pay interest and penalty tax from what would have been 
the last day for payment of the whole of the contribution under 
section 201SL or 201SMAA(6). 
201SQ Deferred GAIC becomes a charge on the land 
 
 
 
(1) A growth areas infrastructure contribution that has 
been deferred under this Subdivision and that has 
not been paid by the due date for payment under 
section 201SP or 201SPAA is a charge on the land 
in respect of which the contribution is imposed. 
 
(2) The charge has priority over all other 
encumbrances to which the land is subject.

INTERPRETATION OF LEGISLATION ACT 1984 (ILA) 
Style changes 
Section 54A of the ILA authorises the making of the style changes set out in 
Schedule 1 to that Act. 
References to ILA s. 39B 
Sidenotes which cite ILA s. 39B refer to section 39B of the ILA which 
provides that where an undivided section or clause of a Schedule is amended 
by the insertion of one or more subsections or subclauses, the original section 
or clause becomes subsection or subclause (1) and is amended by the 
insertion of the expression "(1)" at the beginning of the original section or 
clause. 
Interpretation 
As from 1 January 2001, amendments to section 36 of the ILA have the 
following effects: 
• 
Headings 
All headings included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
form part of that Act.  Any heading inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  This includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in

a Schedule; sections; clauses; items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; 
notes or forms.  See section 36(1A)(2A). 
• 
Examples, diagrams or notes 
All examples, diagrams or notes included in an Act which is passed on or 
after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any examples, diagrams or notes 
inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed 
on or after 1 January 2001, form part of that Act.  See section 36(3A). 
• 
Punctuation 
All punctuation included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
forms part of that Act.  Any punctuation inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  See section 36(3B). 
• 
Provision numbers 
All provision numbers included in an Act form part of that Act, whether 
inserted in the Act before, on or after 1 January 2001.  Provision numbers 
include section numbers, subsection numbers, paragraphs and subparagraphs.  
See section 36(3C). 
• 
Location of "legislative items" 
A "legislative item" is a penalty, an example or a note.  As from 13 October 
2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of an Act is taken to be at the 
foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another legislative 
item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a penalty at the foot of a 
provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items will be 
regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See section 36B. 
• 
Other material 
Any explanatory memorandum, table of provisions, endnotes, index and 
other material printed after the Endnotes does not form part of an Act.   
See section 36(3)(3D)(3E).
