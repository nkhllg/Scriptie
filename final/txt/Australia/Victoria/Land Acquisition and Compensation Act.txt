between its offer and the valuation referred 
to in paragraph (a) if these differ; and 
 
(c) a statement in the prescribed form setting out 
the principal rights and obligations of 
persons whose interests in land have been 
acquired under this Act. 
 
(5) In making its offer the Authority must have regard 
to a valuation of the land carried out by the 
Valuer-General or a person who holds the 
qualifications or experience specified under 
section 13DA(2) of the Valuation of Land Act 
1960.

whichever appears to the Authority to be 
appropriate in the circumstances. 
 
(7) If an offer of compensation is made under this 
section in respect of an acquired interest and 
immediately prior to the date of acquisition— 
 
(a) the interest was affected by another interest 
in the land; or 
 
(b) rates, taxes or other charges were charged 
upon the land in which the interest 
subsists— 
the Authority may reduce the amount of its offer 
by an amount equal to the amount that it considers 
is necessary to provide for that other interest or to 
pay those rates, taxes or other charges. 
 
(8) To the extent that an amount of compensation 
offered under this section, or any part thereof, is 
not disputed, the amount offered is binding upon 
the Authority unless the Authority can

such an offer instead of that information— 
 
(a) must set out the total amount of 
compensation that the Authority proposes to 
pay in respect of the value of all interests in 
the acquired land; and 
 
(b) may set out the amounts of compensation 
which the Authority proposes to pay for any 
other matters in respect of which 
compensation is payable under this Act. 
 
(2) Subject to section 106(1), the Authority, within

with subsection (1), must pay the total amount of 
compensation offered into Court.

money paid into Court under subsection (2) in the 
same manner as it may invest money paid into 
Court under the Supreme Court Act 1958. 
 
(4) As soon as practicable after the payment of money 
into Court in accordance with subsection (2), the 
Authority must apply to the Tribunal or the Court 
(as the case may be) for a determination of the 
amount of compensation which is payable by the 
Authority and the person or persons to whom the 
compensation is payable, and that application 
must be dealt with by the Tribunal or Court as a 
disputed claim for compensation under this Act.

Part 4—Measure of compensation 
 
40 Definitions 
In this Part— 
loss attributable to disturbance means any 
pecuniary loss suffered by a claimant as the 
natural, direct and reasonable consequence 
of— 
 
(a) the service upon the claimant of a 
notice of intention to acquire, where the 
Authority has refused or failed to give 
consent to the carrying out of 
improvements to the land in respect of 
which that notice has been served or the 
effecting or obtaining of any sales, 
transactions, licences or approvals in 
respect of that land; and 
 
(b) the fact that an interest of the claimant 
in that land has been divested or 
diminished, being a pecuniary loss for 
which provision is not otherwise made 
in this Part; 
loss attributable to severance, in relation to the 
acquisition of a claimant's interest in land, 
means the amount of any reduction in the 
market value of any other interest of the 
claimant in the acquired land or any interest 
of the claimant in other land used in 
conjunction with the acquired land which is 
caused by its severance from the acquired 
land; 
market value, in relation to any interest in land on 
a particular date, means the amount of 
money that would have been paid for that 
interest if it had been sold on that date by a 
willing but not anxious seller to a willing but 
not anxious purchaser;

special value, in relation to an interest in land, 
means the value of any pecuniary advantage, 
in addition to market value, to a claimant 
which is incidental to his ownership or 
occupation of that land. 
 
41 General principles on which compensation is to be 
based 
 
(1) Except as otherwise provided in this Part, in 
assessing the amount of compensation payable to 
a claimant in respect of an interest in land which 
is acquired under this Act, regard must be had to 
the following factors— 
 
(a) the market value of the interest on the date of 
acquisition; 
 
(b) any special value to the claimant on the date 
of acquisition; 
 
(c) any loss attributable to severance; 
(d) any loss attributable to disturbance; 
 
(e) the enhancement or depreciation in value of 
the interest of the claimant, at the date of 
acquisition, in other land adjoining or 
severed from the acquired land by reason of 
the implementation of the purpose for which 
the land was acquired; 
 
(f) any legal, valuation and other professional 
expenses necessarily incurred by the 
claimant by reason of the acquisition of the 
interest. 
 
(2) If the market value of an interest in land is 
assessed on the basis that the land had potential to 
be used for a purpose other than the purpose for 
which it was used on the date of acquisition, 
compensation must not be allowed for—

Part 4—Measure of compensation 
 
 
 
Land Acquisition and Compensation Act 1986 
No. 121 of 1986

(a) any special value in respect of any pecuniary 
advantage that would necessarily have been 
forgone in realizing that potential; and 
 
(b) any loss attributable to disturbance that 
would necessarily have been incurred in 
realizing that potential. 
 
(3) If less than the whole of the land in which a 
claimant's interest subsists is acquired or less than 
the whole of that interest is acquired, the market 
value of the acquired interest is the difference 
between the market value of the interest before the 
acquisition and the market value of the interest 
after the acquisition. 
 
(4) The expenses referred to in subsection (1)(f) do 
not include any costs incurred by a claimant in the 
course of prosecuting any proceedings the 
Tribunal or the Court under Part 10. 
 
(5) If compensation has previously been paid in 
respect of the land pursuant to Part 5 of the 
Planning and Environment Act 1987, the 
amount of compensation payable under this Part 
in respect of an acquired interest in land or in 
respect of land in which an acquired interest 
subsists must be reduced by the prescribed 
amount. 
 
(6) If the claimant's interest in the acquired land was 
liable to expire or to be determined, the 
assessment of compensation payable under this 
Part in respect of that interest must take account of 
any reasonable prospect of renewal or 
continuation of the interest. 
 
(7) In this section the prescribed amount in relation 
to land is the amount calculated by the following 
formula—

A = the amount of compensation previously paid 
in respect of the land for loss of market value 
due to— 
 
(i) the reservation or proposed reservation 
of the land or part of the land for a 
public purpose in a planning 
instrument; or 
 
(ii) any part of the land being required for a 
public purpose. 
 
B = the market value of the land in respect of 
which the compensation was paid, that value 
to be determined on the basis of the actual 
zoning that applied to the land at the date 
which was the basis for the calculation of 
that compensation. 
 
C = the compensation payable under this Part for 
market value and severance less the value of 
the land attributable to improvements of a 
durable nature made— 
 
(i) with the consent of the Authority under 
section 12(1)(b); or 
 
(ii) after the last date on which 
compensation was paid in respect of the 
land and before service of the most

42 Reinstatement in particular circumstances 
If— 
 
(a) acquired land was, immediately before the 
date of acquisition, used for a purpose for 
which there is no general market for land 
and, but for the acquisition, would have 
continued to have been used for that purpose;

(b) the claimant has acquired, or intends in good 
faith to acquire, an interest in other land in 
substitution for the interest in the acquired 
land and intends in good faith to use the 
other land for the same purpose for which 
the acquired land was used— 
there may be taken into account, in place of 
market value, an amount ascertained by adding 
together— 
 
(c) the expense of acquiring the interest in the 
other land; and 
 
(d) the expenses and losses incurred or likely to 
be incurred by the claimant as a result of, or 
incidental to, relocation— 
in each case ascertained as at the date when, in all 
the circumstances, it was, or would be, reasonably 
practicable for the claimant to incur the expenses 
or losses, and by subtracting from the amount so 
ascertained the amount, if any, by which the 
claimant has improved, or is likely to improve, the 
claimant's financial position by the relocation. 
 
43 Matters affecting compensation 
 
(1) In assessing compensation, the following matters 
must be disregarded— 
 
(a) any increase or decrease in the market value 
of the interest in land which is acquired 
arising from the carrying out, or the proposal 
to carry out, the purpose for which the 
interest was acquired; 
 
(b) any special suitability or adaptability of the 
land in which the acquired interest subsists 
for a purpose for which it could only be used 
in pursuance of a power conferred by or 
under law, or for which it could only be used 
by the government or a public or local 
authority;

(c) any increase in value of the land in which the 
acquired interest subsists which results from 
the use of that land in a manner or for a

(d) in a case where the land in which the 
acquired interest subsists is reserved for a 
public purpose in a planning instrument, any 
restrictions upon the use or development of 
that land which are imposed by, or are a 
consequence of, the reservation;

(1A) Despite anything to the contrary in this Part, in 
assessing compensation, if— 
 
(a) the land in which the acquired interest 
subsists is reserved for a public purpose in a 
planning instrument; and 
 
(b) the reservation forms the boundary of a zone 
in that planning instrument; and 
 
(c) the decision to impose the zoning boundary 
was not related to the purpose for which the 
interest in land was acquired— 
regard may be had to the actual zoning of the land 
in which the acquired interest subsists and, where 
relevant, to the actual zoning boundary 
 
(2) If any person claims compensation under this Act 
for any loss or damage caused by the severance of 
the land acquired from other lands of that person, 
or the difficulty of access to those other lands, the 
Authority may give notice to that person of its 
intention to make and maintain a gate, bridge, 
easement, road, right-of-way, crossing, passage or 
other work. 
 
(3) Once a notice is given, the Authority and its 
successors must make and maintain the gate, 
bridge, easement, road, right-of-way, crossing, 
passage or work for the accommodation of the 
owners and occupiers of the lands concerned. 
 
(4) Any person or body assessing compensation under 
this Act for the loss or damage referred to in 
subsection (2) must have regard to the bridge, 
easement, road, right-of-way, crossing, passage or 
work in reduction of the amount that would 
otherwise be awarded.

before the commencement of that Act as if 
section 9 of that Act had not been enacted. 
 
(6) Despite the amendment of this section by the

44 Solatium 
 
(1) The amount of compensation may be increased by

reasonable to compensate the claimant for 
intangible and non-pecuniary disadvantages 
resulting from the acquisition. 
 
(2) In assessing the amount payable under 
subsection (1), there must be taken into account 
all relevant circumstances applicable to the 
claimant including, without limiting the generality 
of the foregoing— 
 
(a) the interest of the claimant in the acquired 
land; and 
 
(b) the length of time during which the claimant 
had occupied the land; and

(g) where the claimant at the date of acquisition 
is occupying the land as the claimant's 
principal place of residence, the number, age 
and circumstances of other people (if any) 
living with the claimant. 
 
(3) If no solatium is paid to a claimant, a person other 
than a claimant who, at the date of acquisition, 
had occupied the acquired land for a continuous 
period of not less than 12 months before that date 
as the person's principal place of residence may 
claim from the Authority such amount, not 
exceeding 10% of the market value of the land, by 
way of solatium as is reasonable to compensate 
the person for intangible and non-pecuniary 
disadvantages resulting from the acquisition. 
 
(4) In determining the amount payable under

all relevant circumstances applicable to the 
person, including the matters referred to in 
subsection (2)(b), (c), (d), (e), (f) and (g).

be taken to be a claimant and the claim to be a 
disputed claim for the purposes of this Act.

claimant under this Part is insufficient to 
enable the purchase of a similar interest in 
land to be used by the claimant as a principal

the Authority may, and must if directed by the 
Tribunal or the Court on the application of the 
claimant, grant a loan (with or without interest) of 
such amount as the claimant may reasonably 
require, in addition to the compensation payable,

authorised versions of legislation and up-to-date legislative information. 
Minister's second reading speech— 
Legislative Assembly: 8 May 1986 
Legislative Council: 11 November 1986 
The long title for the Bill for this Act was "A Bill to establish a new 
procedure for the acquisition of land for public purposes, to provide for the 
determination of compensation, and for other purposes.". 
The Land Acquisition and Compensation Act 1986 was assented to on 
23 December 1986 and came into operation on 29 November 1987: 
Government Gazette 25 November 1987 page 3224. 
INTERPRETATION OF LEGISLATION ACT 1984 (ILA) 
Style changes 
Section 54A of the ILA authorises the making of the style changes set out in 
Schedule 1 to that Act. 
References to ILA s. 39B 
Sidenotes which cite ILA s. 39B refer to section 39B of the ILA which 
provides that where an undivided section or clause of a Schedule is amended 
by the insertion of one or more subsections or subclauses, the original section 
or clause becomes subsection or subclause (1) and is amended by the 
insertion of the expression "(1)" at the beginning of the original section or 
clause. 
Interpretation 
As from 1 January 2001, amendments to section 36 of the ILA have the 
following effects: 
• 
Headings 
All headings included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
form part of that Act.  Any heading inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  This includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in 
a Schedule; sections; clauses; items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; 
notes or forms.  See section 36(1A)(2A).

No. 121 of 1986 
93 
  
• 
Examples, diagrams or notes 
All examples, diagrams or notes included in an Act which is passed on or 
after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any examples, diagrams or notes 
inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed 
on or after 1 January 2001, form part of that Act.  See section 36(3A). 
• 
Punctuation 
All punctuation included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
forms part of that Act.  Any punctuation inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  See section 36(3B). 
• 
Provision numbers 
All provision numbers included in an Act form part of that Act, whether 
inserted in the Act before, on or after 1 January 2001.  Provision numbers 
include section numbers, subsection numbers, paragraphs and subparagraphs.  
See section 36(3C). 
• 
Location of "legislative items" 
A "legislative item" is a penalty, an example or a note.  As from 13 October 
2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of an Act is taken to be at the 
foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another legislative 
item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a penalty at the foot of a 
provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items will be 
regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See section 36B. 
• 
Other material 
Any explanatory memorandum, table of provisions, endnotes, index and 
other material printed after the Endnotes does not form part of an Act.   
See section 36(3)(3D)(3E).
