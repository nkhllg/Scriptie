6 The concept of minimising risks of harm to human 
health and the environment 
 
(1) A duty imposed on a person under this Act to 
minimise, so far as reasonably practicable, risks of 
harm to human health and the environment

practicable; and  
 
(b) if it is not reasonably practicable to eliminate 
risks of harm to human health and the 
environment, to reduce those risks so far as 
reasonably practicable.

risks eventuated;

reasonably to know, about the harm or risks 
of harm and any ways of eliminating or 
reducing those risks;

risks.

financial assurance or a related entity of that

affects the financial, physical or personal

if conducted in accordance with the licence, 
would pose an unacceptable risk of harm to 
human health or the environment; 
 
(d) any condition of the licence that specifies 
how a person is to comply with the general 
environmental duty when engaging in a 
licence activity is not sufficient to minimise 
the risks of harm to human health or the

which the condition relates, so far as

Minister's second reading speech— 
Legislative Assembly: 7 June 2017

The long title for the Bill for this Act was "A Bill for an Act to provide for 
the continuation of the Environment Protection Authority, to specify a new 
objective of the Authority, to provide for a new governance structure of the 
continued Authority, to provide for the Governing Board of the Authority 
and to make consequential amendments to the Environment Protection 
Act 1970 and the Public Administration Act 2004 and for other purposes." 
The Environment Protection Act 2017 was assented to on 24 October 2017 
and came into operation as follows: 
Sections 1, 2, 4, 30–32 on 1 January 2018: Special Gazette (No. 433) 12 
December 2017 page 1; sections 3, 5–29, 33–46 on 1 July 2018: section 2(2). 
INTERPRETATION OF LEGISLATION ACT 1984 (ILA) 
Style changes 
Section 54A of the ILA authorises the making of the style changes set out in 
Schedule 1 to that Act. 
References to ILA s. 39B 
Sidenotes which cite ILA s. 39B refer to section 39B of the ILA which 
provides that where an undivided section or clause of a Schedule is amended 
by the insertion of one or more subsections or subclauses, the original section 
or clause becomes subsection or subclause (1) and is amended by the 
insertion of the expression "(1)" at the beginning of the original section or 
clause. 
Interpretation 
As from 1 January 2001, amendments to section 36 of the ILA have the 
following effects: 
• 
Headings 
All headings included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
form part of that Act.  Any heading inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  This includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in

a Schedule; sections; clauses; items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; 
notes or forms.  See section 36(1A)(2A). 
• 
Examples, diagrams or notes 
All examples, diagrams or notes included in an Act which is passed on or 
after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any examples, diagrams or notes 
inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed 
on or after 1 January 2001, form part of that Act.  See section 36(3A). 
• 
Punctuation 
All punctuation included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
forms part of that Act.  Any punctuation inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  See section 36(3B). 
• 
Provision numbers 
All provision numbers included in an Act form part of that Act, whether 
inserted in the Act before, on or after 1 January 2001.  Provision numbers 
include section numbers, subsection numbers, paragraphs and subparagraphs.  
See section 36(3C). 
• 
Location of "legislative items" 
A "legislative item" is a penalty, an example or a note.  As from 13 October 
2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of an Act is taken to be at the 
foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another legislative 
item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a penalty at the foot of a 
provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items will be 
regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See section 36B. 
• 
Other material 
Any explanatory memorandum, table of provisions, endnotes, index and 
other material printed after the Endnotes does not form part of an Act.   
See section 36(3)(3D)(3E).
