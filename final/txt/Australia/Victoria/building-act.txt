Division 4—Cladding rectification subrogation 
 
 
 
 137F Subrogation 
 
 
 
(1) This section applies if, after the commencement of 
section 54 of the Cladding Safety Victoria 
Act 2020, Cladding Safety Victoria pays an 
amount to an owner of a building (the payee) by 
way of a grant of financial assistance in relation to 
cladding rectification work on the building. 
 
(2) When the financial assistance is paid to the payee, 
the Crown is subrogated to all the rights and 
remedies of the payee against any person in 
relation to the installation or use of any 
non-compliant or non-conforming external wall 
cladding product, or other building work, that 
required the cladding rectification work to be 
undertaken. 
 
(3) If a right or remedy to which the Crown is 
subrogated under this section is exercisable 
against an entity that is not an individual, it is 
enforceable jointly and severally against the entity 
and the people who were its officers at the time 
the act or omission that gave rise to the right or 
remedy occurred. 
 
(4) If it is proved that an act or omission by an entity 
occurred without the knowledge or consent of an 
officer of the entity, a right or remedy is not 
enforceable as provided by subsection (3) against 
the officer in relation to the act or omission.

(5) The Crown may exercise its rights and remedies 
under this section in its own name or in the name 
of the payee. 
 
(6) If the Crown brings proceedings under this section 
in the name of the payee, the Crown must 
indemnify the payee against any costs awarded 
against the payee in the proceedings. 
 
(7) If, in exercising its rights and remedies under this 
section, the Crown recovers more money than the 
amount of financial assistance paid to the payee, 
the Crown must pay the difference to the payee 
after deducting costs incurred to recover the 
money. 
 
(8) The payment of an amount referred to in 
subsection (1) in relation to cladding rectification 
work does not affect any right or remedy of the 
Crown by virtue of subsection (2) to recover from 
a person in relation to the installation or use of 
any non-compliant or non-conforming external

insertion of the expression "(1)" at the beginning of the original section or 
clause. 
Interpretation 
As from 1 January 2001, amendments to section 36 of the ILA have the 
following effects: 
• 
Headings 
All headings included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
form part of that Act.  Any heading inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  This includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in 
a Schedule; sections; clauses; items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; 
notes or forms.  See section 36(1A)(2A). 
• 
Examples, diagrams or notes 
All examples, diagrams or notes included in an Act which is passed on or 
after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any examples, diagrams or notes 
inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed 
on or after 1 January 2001, form part of that Act.  See section 36(3A). 
• 
Punctuation 
All punctuation included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
forms part of that Act.  Any punctuation inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  See section 36(3B). 
• 
Provision numbers 
All provision numbers included in an Act form part of that Act, whether 
inserted in the Act before, on or after 1 January 2001.  Provision numbers 
include section numbers, subsection numbers, paragraphs and subparagraphs.  
See section 36(3C). 
• 
Location of "legislative items" 
A "legislative item" is a penalty, an example or a note.  As from 13 October 
2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of an Act is taken to be at the 
foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another legislative 
item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a penalty at the foot of a 
provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items will be 
regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See section 36B. 
• 
Other material 
Any explanatory memorandum, table of provisions, endnotes, index and 
other material printed after the Endnotes does not form part of an Act.   
See section 36(3)(3D)(3E).
