consent is unreasonable. 
 
 
(2) If, after giving each party an opportunity to be

ahead without the residential rental provider's 
consent.

amount for the consent. 
Penalty: 60 penalty units. 
 
(2) If the renter has paid the residential rental 
provider a fee or amount for the consent to an

(1) Subject to this Act, a resident has the right— 
 
 
(a) to reside in the room that the resident 
occupies; and 
 
 
(b) to use the facilities in the rooming house. 
 
(2) A residency right may be an exclusive occupancy 
right or a shared room right. 
 
 
(3) A residency right is an exclusive occupancy right 
unless— 
 
 
(a) the rooming house operator has given the 
resident a notice under section 92C 
specifying that the right is a shared room 
right before the resident commences 
occupation of the room; or 
 
(b) the residency right becomes a shared room 
right under section 94B(2); or 
 
(c) the residency right is deemed to be a shared 
room right under section 530.

(2) To avoid doubt it is declared that 2 or more 
residents may have exclusive occupancy of a

Two domestic partners may share a room and have exclusive 
occupancy.  A rooming house operator would not be able to

A shared room right gives a resident a right to 
occupy the room together with one or more other 
residents chosen by the rooming house operator. 
Example 
A resident takes up occupancy of a room after being given notice 
under section 92C that the resident is to have a shared room right.  
Later that week, without notice to the existing resident, another 
resident takes up occupancy of the same room under a residency 
agreement.  Each resident has a shared room right. 
 
92C Notice to resident of residency right 
 
 
 
(1) A rooming house operator must give each 
proposed resident a notice in accordance with this 
section before the proposed resident commences

(a) be in writing in a form approved by the 
Director; and 
 
(b) specify whether the residency right is to be 
an exclusive occupancy right or a shared 
room right; and 
 
(c) state the date on which it is given; and

(b) state that the resident will not be notified 
before another resident takes up occupancy

 211A Further matters to be considered by Tribunal 
 
(1) Subsection (2) applies in respect of an application 
for compensation for damage to— 
 
(a) rented premises under a residential rental 
agreement; and 
 
(b) a rooming house, including a room or 
common areas of the rooming house; and 
 
(c) a caravan park, caravan or movable 
dwelling; and 
 
(d) a Part 4A park or a Part 4A site. 
 
(2) In calculating an amount of compensation payable 
by a renter, a resident or a site tenant (as the case 
requires) on an application referred to in 
subsection (1), the Tribunal must take into 
account any depreciation of the damaged part of 
the property referred to in subsection (1)(a), (b), 
(c) or (d) by having regard to— 
 
(a) the Uniform Capital Allowance System; or 
 
(b) any other prescribed scale. 
 
(3) In calculating an amount of compensation payable 
on an application under section 210 or 210B for 
early termination of a residential rental agreement 
by the renter, or of a site agreement by the site 
tenant, the Tribunal must— 
 
(a) determine advertising costs and reletting fees 
(if any) incurred by the residential rental 
provider or the site owner (as the case 
requires) on a basis that is proportionate to 
the actual cost of securing the renter or the 
site tenant; and 
Example 
A renter has lived in rented premises under 
a residential rental agreement, on terms including a 
12 month fixed term, rent of $500 per week and a 
reletting fee of $500. The renter notifies the property

manager that the renter will terminate the rental 
agreement 6 months before the end of the fixed term. 
The property manager advertises the rented premises 
for rent immediately and finds a new renter. 
The advertising costs were $250. The new renter 
enters the premises one week after the previous renter 
vacates the premises. The residential rental provider's 
costs of advertising and reletting fees are $1000, 
which is the sum of one week's rent ($500), the 
reletting fee pro-rated for 6 months of the unexpired 
term of the agreement ($250) and advertising 
costs ($250). 
 
(b) determine the amount of compensation for 
loss of rent (if any) by taking into account 
what loss could reasonably have been 
mitigated by the residential rental provider or 
the site owner (as the case requires) by 
promptly reletting the rented premises or the 
Part 4A site; and 
 
(c) have regard to any severe hardship the renter 
or the site tenant would have been expected 
to suffer due to an unforseen change in 
circumstances, if the residential rental 
agreement or site agreement had continued; 
and 
 
(d) not award any compensation for loss 
of future rent to the residential rental 
provider, or the site owner (as the 
case requires), if the residential rental 
provider or the site owner served a notice to 
vacate on the renter or the site tenant, unless 
the notice was served because the renter or 
the site tenant terminated or repudiated the 
residential rental agreement or the site 
agreement; and

may not award an amount of compensation in

the agreement for each 12 month period of the

following effects: 
•

a Schedule; sections; clauses; items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; 
notes or forms.  See section 36(1A)(2A). 
• 
Examples, diagrams or notes 
All examples, diagrams or notes included in an Act which is passed on or 
after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any examples, diagrams or notes 
inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed 
on or after 1 January 2001, form part of that Act.  See section 36(3A). 
• 
Punctuation 
All punctuation included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
forms part of that Act.  Any punctuation inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  See section 36(3B). 
• 
Provision numbers 
All provision numbers included in an Act form part of that Act, whether 
inserted in the Act before, on or after 1 January 2001.  Provision numbers 
include section numbers, subsection numbers, paragraphs and subparagraphs.  
See section 36(3C). 
• 
Location of "legislative items" 
A "legislative item" is a penalty, an example or a note.  As from 13 October 
2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of an Act is taken to be at the 
foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another legislative 
item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a penalty at the foot of a 
provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items will be 
regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See section 36B. 
• 
Other material 
Any explanatory memorandum, table of provisions, endnotes, index and 
other material printed after the Endnotes does not form part of an Act.   
See section 36(3)(3D)(3E).
