Schedule 3—The Commonwealth–State–
Northern Territory Housing Agreement 1981 
Section 29(1) 
AN AGREEMENT made the twenty-third day of December One thousand 
nine hundred and eighty-one between— 
THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA of the first part, 
THE STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES of the second part, 
THE STATE OF VICTORIA of the third part, 
THE STATE OF QUEENSLAND of the fourth part, 
THE STATE OF SOUTH AUSTRALIA of the fifth part, 
THE STATE OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA of the sixth part, 
THE STATE OF TASMANIA of the seventh part, and 
THE NORTHERN TERRITORY OF AUSTRALIA of the eighth part. 
WHEREAS— 
 
(A) the Commonwealth and the States of Australia have from 
time to time entered into agreements for the purpose of the 
provision by the States with financial assistance from the 
Commonwealth of housing for persons who are in need of 
governmental assistance if their housing requirements are to 
be met; 
 
(B) by an agreement dated 17 October 1978, being the 
agreement authorized to be executed on behalf of the 
Commonwealth by the Housing Assistance Act 1978 of the 
Commonwealth Parliament and being the last of the 
agreements referred to in recital (A), provision was so made 
with respect to the three years commencing on 1 July 1978; 
 
(C) the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory of Australia 
entered into an agreement dated the eleventh day of 
March 1980 in relation to the funding of welfare housing in 
the Northern Territory with respect to the two years 
commencing on 1 July 1979; 
 
(D) the Ministers of the respective governments throughout 
Australia who are responsible for housing have agreed upon 
the provision of rental housing assistance and home 
purchase assistance in the various States and in the Northern 
Territory during the five years commencing on 1 July 1981;

(E) the Ministers have affirmed and augmented principles that 
apply to the provision of housing assistance under 
agreements of the nature aforesaid, namely— 
 
(a) housing assistance will— 
 
(i) facilitate home ownership for those able to 
afford it but not able to gain it through the 
private market; 
 
(ii) provide adequate rental housing for those of the 
community who are deemed to be in need of 
governmental assistance at a price that is within 
their capacity to pay; and 
 
(iii) provide assistance for home ownership and 
assistance with rental accommodation in the 
most efficient way and thus to exclude from 
eligibility those NOT in need, to minimise 
continued availability of assistance to those no 
longer in need and to accord benefits which are 
designed so that assistance being provided is 
related to the particular family's or individual's 
current economic and social circumstances; 
 
(b) benefits which are available are offset to the minimum 
extent practicable by poor location of dwellings, an 
inadequate range of choice of dwellings and 
stigmatisation of those who are to receive benefits; 
 
(c) clear recognition is accorded to the separate but 
complementary roles of— 
 
(i) construction and acquisition of dwellings; 
 
(ii) management of the rental operations; and 
 
(iii) sales of dwellings; 
 
(d) maximum social benefit is sought from previous 
investment in housing; 
 
(e) design, style and siting of public housing will to the 
maximum extent practicable— 
 
(i) support the energy conservation policies of the 
governments; and 
 
(ii) reflect the need for accessibility and suitability 
for habitation by handicapped persons; 
 
(f) tenant participation in public housing policies and 
estate management is encouraged; and

(g) the States will be able to exercise maximum

arrangements necessary to achieve these principles; 
 
(F) it is proposed that in order to implement the agreement of 
the Ministers the Commonwealth will grant to the States 
financial assistance under section 96 of the Commonwealth 
of Australia Constitution and like assistance to the Northern 
Territory and that the terms and conditions on which the 
grant of financial assistance should be made are those set 
out in this agreement;

Territory wish to vary in certain respects the operation of the 
agreements which have been entered into as aforesaid; and

agreement and the provision of financial assistance to the 
States in accordance with its provisions:

(1984-1993) 
Section 29A 
AN AGREEMENT made the 12th day of March One thousand nine hundred 
and eighty-five between— 
THE COMMONWEALTH OF AUSTRALIA of the first part, 
THE STATE OF NEW SOUTH WALES of the second part, 
THE STATE OF VICTORIA of the third part,

THE STATE OF WESTERN AUSTRALIA of the fifth part,

WHEREAS: 
(A) the Commonwealth and the States of Australia have from time to 
time entered into agreements for the purpose of the provision by the 
States with financial assistance from the Commonwealth of housing; 
(B) by an agreement between the Commonwealth, the States of

third day of December 1981, being the agreement authorised to be 
executed on behalf of the Commonwealth by the Housing Assistance

respect to the five years commencing on the 1st July 1981; 
(C) the Ministers of the respective governments throughout Australia

(D) the primary principle of this agreement is to ensure that every person 
in Australia has access to adequate and appropriate housing at a 
price within his or her capacity to pay by seeking to:

• alleviate housing-related poverty; and 
• ensure that housing assistance is, as far as possible, delivered 
equitably to persons resident in different forms of housing 
tenure; 
in implementing this principle, assistance provided under the 
agreement will also reflect the following detailed principles: 
(a) Assistance Generally 
the primary consideration in delivering housing assistance 
under this agreement will be the needs of people, rather than to 
attach assistance to particular dwellings or categories of 
dwellings; 
housing assistance provided under this agreement will be 
available to all sections of the community irrespective of age, 
sex, marital status, race, religion, disability or life situation. 
However, priority in granting assistance shall be determined by 
the need for assistance; 
in delivering housing assistance, as far as possible, people 
should be given an equal choice between the types of housing 
assistance available; 
housing assistance programs developed under this agreement 
should be designed so that maximum social benefit is derived 
from previous investment in housing; 
housing assistance provided under this agreement should be co-
ordinated with housing assistance programs that are developed 
outside this agreement; 
(b) Public Rental Housing 
programs and funding arrangements under this agreement 
should seek to develop the public housing sector as a viable 
and diversified form of housing choice and refrain from 
discrimination; 
programs and funding arrangements under this agreement shall 
be developed so as to increase progressively the availability of 
public housing to a level commensurate with the need for it in 
the community; 
public housing should reflect general community housing 
standards and should be accessible to community and other 
services. Poor location of dwellings, an inadequate range of 
choice of dwellings, and stigmatisation of the status of public 
tenants should be avoided to the maximum extent practicable;

No. 10020 of 1983 
165 
  
public housing stock should, as far as possible, be designed to 
cater for the needs and preferences of current and likely future 
applicants; 
clear recognition should be accorded to the separate but 
complementary roles of: 
• capital expenditure on constructing and acquiring 
dwellings; 
• financing of rental operations; 
• managing rental operations including assistance for 
tenants; and 
• sales of dwellings; 
the design, style and siting of public housing will, to the 
maximum extent practicable: 
• reflect the need for accessibility and suitability for 
habitation by disabled persons, Aboriginals, youth, the 
elderly, or other identified groups; and 
• support the energy conservation policies of the 
governments; 
public housing authorities should ensure that tenants have 
maximum opportunity to participate in the management of their 
dwellings and estates and in the development of public housing 
policies; 
(c) Income-Related Assistance to Tenants 
programs developed under this agreement should recognise the 
problems created by the inability of some tenants to afford 
adequate rental accommodation in both public and private 
rental sectors; 
assistance measures in the public rental sector should be 
co-ordinated with assistance to private tenants and should 
recognise the income support nature of the assistance and the 
inter-relationship of this assistance with Commonwealth 
assistance to pensioners and other beneficiaries under the 
Social Security Act 1947; 
(d) Home Ownership Assistance 
assistance under this agreement shall seek to provide home 
ownership opportunities for those unable to obtain or maintain 
affordable finance from the private sector or from other sources 
outside the agreement;

(e) Implementation 
the State will be able to exercise maximum autonomy and 
flexibility in developing the administrative arrangements 
necessary to achieve these principles; 
(E) the Ministers referred to in Recital (C) recognise the relationship 
between the principles and policies reflected in this agreement and 
the need to co-ordinate these with those affecting generally home

emergency and supported accommodation; 
(F) it is proposed that in order to implement the agreement of the 
Ministers the Commonwealth will grant to the States financial 
assistance under section 96 of the Commonwealth of Australia 
Constitution and like assistance to the Northern Territory and that 
the terms and conditions on which the grant of financial assistance 
should be made are those set out in this agreement; 
(G) the Commonwealth the States and the Northern Territory have 
decided that the agreement referred to in Recital (B) shall cease to

SECOND SCHEDULE 
Clause 32 
COST RENT FORMULA 
The following formula is to be used to determine real cost rents for public 
rental accommodation. States are to charge rents at least equal to those 
resulting from the use of this formula. The formula is not to be applied to the 
costs of individual dwellings but rather to the total cost pool of the rental 
stock. In allocating the total cost rent pool to individual tenancies States will 
have regard to variation in housing standards and locations within the 
constraints of available administrative arrangements for assessing these 
variations. 
 
1. Recovery of operating expenses 
The costs to be recovered in this area are ordinarily listed in 
the rental accounts of State housing authorities as yearly 
expenditure items. These include— 
 
(a) administration; 
 
(b) rates; 
 
(c) insurance; 
 
(d) specific operating expenses associated with particular 
types of units; 
 
(e) annual maintenance; 
 
(f) yearly allowance for rent arrears and debts written off; 
 
(g) yearly allowance for vacancies; 
 
(h) leasing expenses related to land and dwellings; 
 
(i) operating expenses of community facilities; and 
 
(j) any other operating costs agreed between Federal and 
State Housing Ministers. 
 
2. Interest Charges 
Interest payable on loan funds invested in public rental 
housing. 
 
3. Depreciation 
 
(i) depreciation rate is to reflect a life of between 40–75 years 
of the capital improvements on the land; 
 
(ii) the value of capital improvement will be based on the 
estimated current capital improved value;

1 General information 
See www.legislation.vic.gov.au for Victorian Bills, Acts and current 
authorised versions of legislation and up-to-date legislative information. 
The Housing Act 1983 was assented to on 13 December 1983 and came into 
operation on 1 January 1984: Government Gazette 21 December 1983 
page 4045. 
INTERPRETATION OF LEGISLATION ACT 1984 (ILA) 
Style changes 
Section 54A of the ILA authorises the making of the style changes set out in 
Schedule 1 to that Act. 
References to ILA s. 39B 
Sidenotes which cite ILA s. 39B refer to section 39B of the ILA which 
provides that where an undivided section or clause of a Schedule is amended 
by the insertion of one or more subsections or subclauses, the original section 
or clause becomes subsection or subclause (1) and is amended by the 
insertion of the expression "(1)" at the beginning of the original section or 
clause. 
Interpretation 
As from 1 January 2001, amendments to section 36 of the ILA have the 
following effects: 
• 
Headings 
All headings included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
form part of that Act.  Any heading inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  This includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in 
a Schedule; sections; clauses; items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; 
notes or forms.  See section 36(1A)(2A). 
• 
Examples, diagrams or notes 
All examples, diagrams or notes included in an Act which is passed on or 
after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any examples, diagrams or notes 
inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed 
on or after 1 January 2001, form part of that Act.  See section 36(3A).

No. 10020 of 1983 
221 
  
• 
Punctuation 
All punctuation included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
forms part of that Act.  Any punctuation inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  See section 36(3B). 
• 
Provision numbers 
All provision numbers included in an Act form part of that Act, whether 
inserted in the Act before, on or after 1 January 2001.  Provision numbers 
include section numbers, subsection numbers, paragraphs and subparagraphs.  
See section 36(3C). 
• 
Location of "legislative items" 
A "legislative item" is a penalty, an example or a note.  As from 13 October 
2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of an Act is taken to be at the 
foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another legislative 
item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a penalty at the foot of a 
provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items will be 
regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See section 36B. 
• 
Other material 
Any explanatory memorandum, table of provisions, endnotes, index and 
other material printed after the Endnotes does not form part of an Act.   
See section 36(3)(3D)(3E).
