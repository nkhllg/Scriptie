35 Insurance held by vendor to enure for benefit of 
purchaser 
 
(1) During the period between the making of a 
contract for the sale of land and the purchaser 
becoming entitled to possession or to the receipt 
of rents and profits pursuant to the terms of the 
contract, any policy of insurance maintained 
by the vendor in respect of any damage to or 
destruction of any part of the land agreed to be 
sold pursuant to the contract shall in respect of the 
said land, to the extent that the purchaser is not 
entitled to be indemnified under any other policy 
of insurance, enure for the benefit of the purchaser 
as well as for the vendor and the purchaser shall 
be entitled to be indemnified by the insurer under 
any such insurance policy in the same manner and 
to the same extent as the vendor would have been 
if the land had not been subject to the contract. 
 
(2) It shall not be a defence or answer to any claim 
by the purchaser against the insurer made under 
subsection (1) hereof that the vendor otherwise 
would not be entitled to be indemnified by the 
insurer because the vendor has suffered no loss or 
has suffered diminished loss by reason of the fact 
that the vendor is entitled to be paid the purchase 
price or the balance thereof by the purchaser. 
 
(3) A policy of insurance shall not enure for the 
benefit of a purchaser under subsection (1) hereof 
if the insurer establishes that a prudent insurer 
would not have insured the purchaser against the 
risk covered by the policy. 
 
(4) At any time prior to the happening of the risk 
insured against an insurer made liable to a 
purchaser under subsection (1) may terminate 
that liability by giving notice of such termination 
to the purchaser in not less than three clear 
business days.

destruction of part of the land agreed to be sold 
the money shall, on completion of the contract be

purchaser and paid by the vendor to the purchaser 
on completion of the sale or as soon as the money 
is received by the vendor (whichever is the later).

daily unpaid balance of purchase money excluding interest (if shown in 
the contract) or, if that is not shown in the contract, the lowest cash price 
at which the land might be bought, will yield the amount equal to the 
total interest. 
*2. Delete where inapplicable. 
  3. If the interest rate is variable the amount in the Schedule should be 
calculated as if the rate did not vary. 
  4. Amounts in the Schedule must be calculated as if all payments were 
made as and when they fall due, but the penalty for late payment must 
still be shown. 
*5. If the payments vary in amount, specify the amount of each repayment.

INTERPRETATION OF LEGISLATION ACT 1984 (ILA) 
Style changes 
Section 54A of the ILA authorises the making of the style changes set out in 
Schedule 1 to that Act. 
References to ILA s. 39B 
Sidenotes which cite ILA s. 39B refer to section 39B of the ILA which 
provides that where an undivided section or clause of a Schedule is amended 
by the insertion of one or more subsections or subclauses, the original section 
or clause becomes subsection or subclause (1) and is amended by the 
insertion of the expression "(1)" at the beginning of the original section or 
clause. 
Interpretation 
As from 1 January 2001, amendments to section 36 of the ILA have the 
following effects: 
• 
Headings 
All headings included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
form part of that Act.  Any heading inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  This includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in 
a Schedule; sections; clauses; items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; 
notes or forms.  See section 36(1A)(2A). 
• 
Examples, diagrams or notes 
All examples, diagrams or notes included in an Act which is passed on or 
after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any examples, diagrams or notes 
inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed 
on or after 1 January 2001, form part of that Act.  See section 36(3A).

No. 6975 of 1962 
123 
  
• 
Punctuation 
All punctuation included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
forms part of that Act.  Any punctuation inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  See section 36(3B). 
• 
Provision numbers 
All provision numbers included in an Act form part of that Act, whether 
inserted in the Act before, on or after 1 January 2001.  Provision numbers 
include section numbers, subsection numbers, paragraphs and subparagraphs.  
See section 36(3C). 
• 
Location of "legislative items" 
A "legislative item" is a penalty, an example or a note.  As from 13 October 
2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of an Act is taken to be at the 
foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another legislative 
item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a penalty at the foot of a 
provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items will be 
regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See section 36B. 
• 
Other material 
Any explanatory memorandum, table of provisions, endnotes, index and 
other material printed after the Endnotes does not form part of an Act.   
See section 36(3)(3D)(3E).
