supplied to enable the Registrar to 
create a folio of the Register under

for any other reason it is not convenient 
to bring the land under this Act by 
using a conversion scheme under 
Division 2; 
 
(b) create a provisional folio or identified folio 
under Division 3 if—

(11) On— 
 
(a) the production of a new certificate of title for 
a folio of the Register; or 
 
(b) the deletion of a folio from the Register— 
any certificate of title subsisting for that folio 
ceases to have effect, and, upon it being 
submitted to the Registrar, the Registrar, subject 
to section 27BA, must destroy it. 
 
(12) The Registrar may, in the same document, include 
a certificate of title and any other information that 
the Registrar considers appropriate, but that 
information is not part of the certificate of title. 
 
(13) Despite anything to the contrary in this section, 
the Registrar must not produce a certificate of title 
for an identified folio. 
27BAA Declaration voiding certificates of title 
 
(1) The Registrar, by notice published in the 
Government Gazette, may declare certificates of 
title or classes of certificate of title to be void and 
of no effect. 
 
(2) A declaration published by notice under 
subsection (1) takes effect from the date specified 
in the notice that is not earlier than the date of 
publication of the notice in the Government 
Gazette. 
 
(3) Any certificate of title, or a certificate of title in a 
declared class of certificates of title, in existence 
immediately before the date specified in the notice 
referred to in subsection (1) is, on and after that 
date, void and of no effect.

 27BA Power not to destroy certain certificates of title 
 
 
 
(1) If a folio of the Register has been deleted or 
amended, the Registrar is not required to destroy 
the certificate of title for that folio if the Registrar 
ensures that the certificate of title is marked, 
stamped or otherwise rendered unusable. 
 
(2) The Registrar may return a certificate of title 
which has been rendered unusable to the last 
registered proprietor shown on the deleted or 
amended folio of the Register to which that 
certificate of title related. 
 
27C Record of dealings 
 
(1) The Registrar must keep a record of all dealings 
recorded in, or action taken in respect of, any folio 
of the Register, and any other information in 
relation to folios of the Register that the Registrar 
thinks fit. 
 
(2) The record of dealings is not part of the Register.

27D Evidence 
 
(1) In any proceedings a document certified in writing 
signed by the Registrar to be a record, as at a 
particular date, of the information recorded on any 
part of a folio of the Register is conclusive proof, 
without production of the folio of the Register, 
that at that date the recordings on the folio to 
which the document applies were as stated in the 
document.

(2) A document under subsection (1) may relate to 
recordings on a folio of the Register or to 
recordings existing at any earlier time. 
 
(3) If a document under subsection (1) relates to 
recordings other than the recordings on a folio of 
the Register, the document may be based on 
information derived from other records or 
documents kept by or available to the Registrar. 
 
(4) Subsections (2) and (3) also apply, with the 
necessary modifications, to a document certified 
under subsection (1) that relates to a recording in 
the Register that has become illegible or 
unavailable. 
 
(5) Subject to this section, that part of a certificate of 
title that contains, or purports to contain, a record 
of information recorded on a folio of the Register, 
is evidence and, in the absence of evidence to the 
contrary, is proof that, at the date of the certificate 
that folio of the Register contained a recording of 
that information. 
 
(6) If in relation to any matter there is an 
inconsistency between a statement on a certificate 
of title and a statement recorded in the Register, 
the statement in the Register prevails.

(e) a transfer or dealing the registration or entry 
of which is provided for in the caveat— 
 
upon the expiration of thirty days after notice 
given by the Registrar to the caveator that a 
transfer or dealing has been lodged for 
registration, but in the case of a transfer or other 
dealing which does not dispose of the whole of the 
estate or interest of the registered proprietor in the 
land affected thereby the caveat shall lapse only to 
the extent necessary to permit the registration of 
the transfer or dealing. 
 
(2) If before the expiration of the said period of thirty 
days or such further period as is specified in any 
order made under this subsection the caveator or 
the caveator's agent appears before a court and 
gives such undertaking or security or lodges such 
sum as the court considers sufficient to indemnify 
every person against any damage that may be 
sustained by reason of any disposition of the 
property being delayed, the court may direct the 
Registrar to delay registering any dealing with the 
land for a further period specified in the order, or 
may make such other order (and in either case 
such order as to costs) as is just. 
 
(3) Any person who is adversely affected by any such 
caveat may bring proceedings in a court against 
the caveator for the removal of the caveat and the 
court may make such order as the court thinks fit. 
 
(4) Where a caveat lapses in whole or in part by 
virtue of subsection (1) in consequence of the 
lodging of a transfer or dealing and the transfer 
or dealing is withdrawn from registration or the 
Registrar exercises any of the powers conferred 
on the Registrar by section 105(1) in respect of it, 
the Registrar shall reinstate the recording of the 
caveat in any relevant part of the Register to

1 General information 
See www.legislation.vic.gov.au for Victorian Bills, Acts and current 
authorised versions of legislation and up-to-date legislative information. 
The Transfer of Land Act 1958 was assented to on 30 September 1958 and 
came into operation on 1 April 1959: Government Gazette 18 March 1959 
page 893. 
INTERPRETATION OF LEGISLATION ACT 1984 (ILA) 
Style changes 
Section 54A of the ILA authorises the making of the style changes set out in 
Schedule 1 to that Act. 
References to ILA s. 39B 
Sidenotes which cite ILA s. 39B refer to section 39B of the ILA which 
provides that where an undivided section or clause of a Schedule is amended 
by the insertion of one or more subsections or subclauses, the original section 
or clause becomes subsection or subclause (1) and is amended by the 
insertion of the expression "(1)" at the beginning of the original section or 
clause. 
Interpretation 
As from 1 January 2001, amendments to section 36 of the ILA have the 
following effects: 
• 
Headings 
All headings included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
form part of that Act.  Any heading inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  This includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in 
a Schedule; sections; clauses; items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; 
notes or forms.  See section 36(1A)(2A). 
• 
Examples, diagrams or notes 
All examples, diagrams or notes included in an Act which is passed on or 
after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any examples, diagrams or notes 
inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed 
on or after 1 January 2001, form part of that Act.  See section 36(3A).

No. 6399 of 1958 
217 
  
• 
Punctuation 
All punctuation included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
forms part of that Act.  Any punctuation inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  See section 36(3B). 
• 
Provision numbers 
All provision numbers included in an Act form part of that Act, whether 
inserted in the Act before, on or after 1 January 2001.  Provision numbers 
include section numbers, subsection numbers, paragraphs and subparagraphs.  
See section 36(3C). 
• 
Location of "legislative items" 
A "legislative item" is a penalty, an example or a note.  As from 13 October 
2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of an Act is taken to be at the 
foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another legislative 
item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a penalty at the foot of a 
provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items will be 
regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See section 36B. 
• 
Other material 
Any explanatory memorandum, table of provisions, endnotes, index and 
other material printed after the Endnotes does not form part of an Act.   
See section 36(3)(3D)(3E).
