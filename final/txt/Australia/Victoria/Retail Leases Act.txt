9 Meaning of renewal of a lease 
 
(1) In this Act, the renewal of a retail premises lease 
means the renewal of the lease— 
 
(a) under an option granted under the lease for a 
further term; or 
 
(b) under an agreement to renew the lease on 
substantially the same terms and conditions, 
except as to rent, for a further term entered 
into by all of the parties to the lease. 
 
(2) However, if— 
 
(a) after a retail premises lease expires, there is a 
break in the tenant's possession of the 
premises; and 
 
(b) the tenant resumes possession of the 
premises for a further term (whether or not 
on the same terms and conditions as under 
the expired lease)— 
the resumption of possession of the premises is 
taken not to be a renewal of the expired lease and 
is instead taken to be the entering into of a new 
lease for the purposes of this Act. 
 
(3) The renewal of a retail premises lease is not to be 
taken to be the entering into of a retail premises 
lease for the purposes of section 17 (landlord's 
disclosure statement). 
 
10 Holding over under a retail premises lease  
If, in accordance with a retail premises lease, the 
tenant continues to be in possession of the retail 
premises for a period after the lease has expired, 
the lease is taken to continue for the purposes of 
this Act while the tenant is in possession of the 
premises.

(1) If a tenant under a retail premises lease gives the 
landlord a notice of termination under— 
 
(a) section 17(3)(c) within the time allowed by 
that section; or 
 
(b) section 17(5) within the time allowed by 
section 17(6)— 
the lease terminates 14 days after the notice is 
given unless the landlord gives the tenant a notice 
of objection to the termination. 
 
(2) Within 14 days after being given the notice of 
termination the landlord may give the tenant a 
notice of objection to the termination on the 
ground that— 
 
(a) the landlord has acted honestly and 
reasonably and ought fairly to be excused for 
the contravention; and 
 
(b) the tenant is substantially in as good a 
position as the tenant would have been in if 
there had been no contravention. 
 
(3) If the tenant advises the landlord that the tenant 
accepts the landlord's notice of objection or the 
notice is upheld under Part 10, the lease does not 
terminate in accordance with the notice of 
termination despite subsection (1).

(4) The tenant is taken to have accepted the notice of 
objection if the tenant does not advise (in writing) 
the landlord, within 14 days after being given the 
notice, whether or not the tenant accepts it. 
 
(5) The operation of a notice of termination under 
section 17(3)(c) or (5) is suspended until the effect 
of a notice of objection to it is determined. 
 
19 Notices of termination 
The termination of a lease by a notice of 
termination given in accordance with this Act 
does not affect any right, privilege, obligation or 
liability acquired, accrued or incurred under the 
lease before the date of termination, unless the 
landlord and tenant otherwise agree or it is 
otherwise provided by this Act or determined 
under Part 10. 
 
20 Tenant not required to pay undisclosed 
contributions 
A provision of a retail premises lease that requires 
the tenant to pay or contribute towards the cost of 
any fit out of the retail premises is void unless the 
liability to make the payment or contribution was 
disclosed in a disclosure statement given to the 
tenant in accordance with this Part. 
 
21 Minimum 5 year term 
 
(1) The term of a retail premises lease, including any 
further term or terms provided for by an option for 
the tenant to renew the lease, must be at least 
5 years or, if the term remaining under any head 
lease under which the landlord holds the retail 
premises is 5 years or less, the length of that 
remaining term less one day.

Note 
The landlord or tenant may, in accordance with the lease or 
this Act, be able to terminate the lease before the end of the 
term if, for example, there has been default, relocation, 
demolition or damage to the retail premises.  
 
(2) In applying subsection (1), an option conferred 
after the lease was entered into must be 
disregarded. 
 
(2A) In applying subsection (1) to a retail premises 
lease to which this Act applies because of 
section 12(2), account must be taken of any period 
during which the tenant was continuously entitled 
to possession of the retail premises before the day 
on which this Act first applied to the lease. 
Note 
Section 8 provides that an assignment of a retail premises 
lease is taken to be a continuation of that lease. 
 
(3) This section does not apply to a renewal of a lease 
if there is no break in the tenant's entitlement to 
possession of the retail premises. 
Note 
This means that a renewal of a lease is not required to be for 
5 years because the minimum 5 year term requirement 
applied to the lease when it was entered into and the 
availability of the renewal will have been taken into account 
in determining the term of the lease. 
 
(4) A lease that is entered into contrary to this section 
is not illegal, invalid or unenforceable because of 
that fact but the term of the lease is extended by 
the period that is necessary to ensure the lease 
complies with this section. 
Note 
For example, if a lease is entered into for a term of 3 years, 
its term is extended by 2 years to 5 years.  If a lease is 
entered into for a term of 2 years with an option for a further 
1 year after the initial 2 years, the term of the lease is 
extended to 4 years (with the option for a further 1 year after 
the initial 4 years).

(5) This section does not apply to a lease if— 
 
(a) at the request of the tenant or prospective 
tenant, the Small Business Commission 
certifies in writing that it, or a person acting 
on its behalf, has explained to the tenant or 
prospective tenant— 
 
(i) the effect of subsections (1) to (4); and 
 
(ii) that the giving of the certificate and the 
giving by the tenant or prospective 
tenant to the landlord of a copy of the 
certificate under paragraph (b) will 
result in this section not applying to the 
lease; and 
 
(b) after having been given a certificate under 
paragraph (a)(ii), the tenant or prospective 
tenant gives the landlord a copy of the 
certificate. 
 
(5A) The Small Business Commission— 
 
(a) must consider a request under subsection (5) 
made by a tenant or a prospective tenant 
before a lease is entered into and within 
90 days after a lease is entered into; and 
 
(b) may consider a request made at any other 
time under subsection (5). 
 
(6) The Small Business Commission must issue a 
certificate under subsection (5)(a)(ii) within 
21 days after being requested to do so by the 
tenant or prospective tenant but a certificate issued 
later than that is not invalid because of that fact. 
 
(7) If the term of a lease is extended under this 
section and no provision is made in the lease for a 
review of the rent payable in respect of the 
extended period, then the lease is taken to provide 
for a rent review to be made on the basis of the

(1) Within 28 days, or such other period as is agreed 
in writing between the landlord and the tenant, 
after being given a copy of the retail premises 
lease signed by the tenant, the landlord must give 
the tenant a copy (which may be a photocopy) of

(2) If the landlord contravenes subsection (1), the 
tenant may give the landlord a written notice of

(b) entering into the lease—

the landlord has substantially complied with 
the landlord's obligations concerning the fit 
out of the premises; and 
 
(b) except on reasonable grounds of safety, the 
landlord is not entitled to deny the tenant 
possession of the premises merely because 
the landlord has not complied with those 
obligations. 
 
32 Special rent—cost of fit out

refurbishments 
A retail premises lease is taken to provide that the 
landlord must not start to carry out any alteration 
or refurbishment of the building or retail shopping 
centre in which the retail premises are located 
which is likely to affect adversely the business of 
the tenant unless— 
 
(a) the landlord has notified the tenant in writing 
of the proposed alteration or refurbishment at 
least 60 days before it is started; or 
 
(b) the alteration or refurbishment is necessary 
because of an emergency and the landlord

notice that is reasonably practicable in the 
circumstances. 
 
54 Tenant to be compensated for interference 
 
(1) A retail premises lease is taken to provide as set 
out in this section. 
 
(2) The landlord is liable to pay to the tenant 
reasonable compensation for loss or damage 
(other than nominal damage) suffered by the

the retail premises; or 
 
(b) unreasonably takes action that substantially 
inhibits or alters the flow of customers to the

in which the retail premises are located 
(but not the retail premises themselves). 
 
(3) The tenant must give the landlord written notice 
of the loss or damage as soon as practicable after

landlord— 
 
(a) as a reasonable response to an emergency; or 
 
(b) in compliance with any duty imposed by or

practicable time after the relocation; and 
 
(b) cannot be carried out practicably without 
vacant possession of the retail premises. 
 
(3) The landlord cannot require the tenant's business

the difference in the commercial values of 
the premises at the time of relocation. 
 
(5) Within one month after being given a relocation 
notice, the tenant may give the landlord a written 
notice of termination and the lease terminates 
3 months after the relocation notice was given or 
at such other time as the landlord and tenant 
agree.

56 Demolition 
 
(1) A retail premises lease that provides for 
termination of the lease on the ground of proposed 
demolition of the building in which the retail 
premises are located is taken to provide as set out 
in this section.

proposed demolition that are sufficient to 
indicate a genuine proposal to demolish the

57 Damaged premises 
 
(1) A retail premises lease is taken to provide the

which the premises are located, is damaged— 
 
(a) except where the tenant caused the damage, 
the tenant is not liable to pay rent, or any

during which the premises cannot be used

damage; and 
 
(b) except where the tenant caused the damage, 
if the premises can be used under the lease 
but that use is reduced to some extent by the 
damage, the tenant's liability for rent, and 
any amount in respect of outgoings or other 
charges, that is attributable to any period 
during which the use is reduced is decreased 
to the same extent; and 
 
(c) if the landlord reasonably considers that the 
extent of damage makes its repair

tenant in writing of that, the landlord or 
tenant may terminate the lease by giving not 
less than 7 days' written notice of 
termination to the other party; and 
 
(d) if the landlord fails to repair the damage 
within a reasonable time after the tenant asks 
the landlord in writing to do so, the tenant 
may terminate the lease by giving not less 
than 7 days' written notice of termination to 
the landlord; and 
 
(e) this subsection does not affect any right of 
the landlord to recover damages from the 
tenant in respect of any damage covered by

93 Indemnities 
 
(1) A provision in a retail premises lease is void to the 
extent that it purports to indemnify, or require the 
tenant to indemnify, the landlord against any 
action, liability, penalty, claim or demand for or to 
which the landlord would otherwise be liable or 
subject. 
 
(2) A provision in a retail premises lease is void to the 
extent that it purports to make the tenant liable for 
or subject to any action, liability, penalty, claim or 
demand in respect of any act, matter or thing done 
or omitted to be done by the landlord or any other 
person if the tenant would not otherwise be liable 
for or subject to that action, liability, penalty, 
claim or demand.

agreements etc. 
 
(1) A provision of a retail premises lease or of an 
agreement (whether or not the agreement is 
between parties to a retail premises lease) is void 
to the extent that it is contrary to or inconsistent 
with anything in this Act (including anything that 
the lease is taken to include or provide because of 
a provision of this Act).  
 
(2) A provision of a retail premises lease or of an 
agreement (whether or not the agreement is 
between parties to a retail premises lease) is void 
to the extent that it purports— 
 
(a) to exclude the application of a provision of 
this Act; or 
 
(b) to limit the right of a party to the lease to 
seek resolution of a retail tenancy dispute 
under Part 10 or otherwise to limit the 
application of that Part. 
 
(3) A provision contained in any other agreement or 
arrangement (whether or not between parties to a 
retail premises lease) is void if that provision 
would be void under this Act if it were contained 
in a retail premises lease.

lessor must give a lessee notice before exercising a right of 
re-entry or forfeiture.

tenant to occupy a residential area in the 
building in which the retail premises are 
located; and 
 
(b) the Residential Tenancies Act 1997 does 
not apply to the lease to the extent that it 
provides for the occupation of the residential 
area— 
the retail premises lease is taken to provide that 
the landlord must ensure that the residential area 
is maintained in good repair. 
 
96 Franchise arrangements 
 
(1) This section applies if a person proposes to grant a 
licence to another person to use all or part of any 
retail premises wholly or predominantly for the

118 Repeal of Retail Tenancies Reform Act 1998 
The Retail Tenancies Reform Act 1998 is 
repealed. 
 
119 General transitional and savings 
 
(1) Despite the repeal of the Retail Tenancies 
Reform Act 1998 but subject to Part 10 of this 
Act, that Act continues to apply, and from 
1 November 2003 applies as amended by Part 12 
of this Act, to a retail premises lease to which it 
applied immediately before its repeal. 
 
(2) However, if proceedings under Part 3 of the 
Retail Tenancies Reform Act 1998 have been 
commenced but are not completed before that Act 
is repealed, Part 3 of that Act continues to apply to 
those proceedings despite that repeal and despite 
Part 10 of this Act. 
 
(3) Sections 39 and 52 of the Retail Tenancies 
Reform Act 1998, as in force immediately before 
the repeal of that Act, continue to have effect 
despite that repeal. 
 
(4) For the avoidance of doubt it is declared that the 
effect of section 4(1) of the Retail Tenancies 
Reform Act 1998 is, and always has been, to 
apply that Act to a retail premises lease within the 
meaning of that Act that was entered into on or 
after 1 July 1998 including one entered into under 
an option provided under such a lease that was 
entered into before that date.

Schedule 1 to that Act. 
References to ILA s. 39B 
Sidenotes which cite ILA s. 39B refer to section 39B of the ILA which 
provides that where an undivided section or clause of a Schedule is amended 
by the insertion of one or more subsections or subclauses, the original section 
or clause becomes subsection or subclause (1) and is amended by the 
insertion of the expression "(1)" at the beginning of the original section or 
clause.

following effects: 
• 
Headings 
All headings included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
form part of that Act.  Any heading inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  This includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in

a Schedule; sections; clauses; items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; 
notes or forms.  See section 36(1A)(2A). 
• 
Examples, diagrams or notes 
All examples, diagrams or notes included in an Act which is passed on or 
after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any examples, diagrams or notes 
inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed 
on or after 1 January 2001, form part of that Act.  See section 36(3A). 
• 
Punctuation 
All punctuation included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
forms part of that Act.  Any punctuation inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  See section 36(3B). 
• 
Provision numbers 
All provision numbers included in an Act form part of that Act, whether 
inserted in the Act before, on or after 1 January 2001.  Provision numbers 
include section numbers, subsection numbers, paragraphs and subparagraphs.  
See section 36(3C). 
• 
Location of "legislative items" 
A "legislative item" is a penalty, an example or a note.  As from 13 October 
2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of an Act is taken to be at the 
foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another legislative 
item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a penalty at the foot of a 
provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items will be 
regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See section 36B. 
• 
Other material 
Any explanatory memorandum, table of provisions, endnotes, index and 
other material printed after the Endnotes does not form part of an Act.   
See section 36(3)(3D)(3E).
