the land in proportion to that interest); and 
 
(b) any other taxable land owned by the owner 
alone; and 
 
(c) the owner's individual interest in any other 
taxable land. 
 
(3A) For the purpose of assessing land tax under 
subsection (3), joint owners of taxable land who 
are joint tenants of the land are taken to hold the 
land as tenants in common in equal shares. 
 
(4) There is to be deducted from the land tax assessed 
for a joint owner under subsection (3) an amount 
(if any) necessary to avoid double taxation, being 
the lesser of—

A ×
 
where— 
 
A is the proportion of the owner's 
individual interest in the jointly-owned

46IAA Absentee proportion of interests in land subject to a 
trust in a chain of trusts 
 
(1) The absentee proportion of interests in land 
subject to a trust to the total interests in the land 
is the proportion of all the interests in that land 
that— 
 
(a) natural person absentees or absentee 
corporations have in that land directly or 
indirectly through one or more chains of 
trusts that they do not hold on trust for 
another person; or 
 
(b) persons have in that land directly or 
indirectly through one or more chains of 
trusts as trustee of an absentee trust that is a 
discretionary trust. 
 
(2) Without limiting subsection (1), in calculating the 
absentee proportion of interests in land subject to 
a trust, a unitholding in a unit trust scheme is to be 
treated as an interest in the land. 
Examples 
Schedule 1A sets out examples of how the absentee proportion 
of interests in land subject to a trust that is in a chain of trusts is 
calculated.

rental agreements. Person A owns dwellings 1 to 15, Person 
B owns dwellings 16 to 30 and Person C owns dwellings 31

70D What is a single management entity? 
 
(1) For the purposes of section 70B(1)(c), a 
BTR development is managed by a single

dwellings, together with the existing 
dwellings, satisfy the requirements specified 
in paragraphs (a) to (e) of section 70B(1). 
 
(2) The occupancy date for any additional dwellings 
that form part of an eligible BTR development is

occupancy.  
 
(3) The fifteen year eligibility requirement applies to 
any additional dwellings that form part of an 
eligible BTR development from the occupancy 
date of those dwellings.

benefits in a tax year if a BTR benefit has applied 
to the land or part of land in a previous tax year 
and those tax years do not fall within one 
continuous period of eligibility for the BTR 
benefits.  
 
(4) For avoidance of doubt, if an eligible BTR 
development has more than one occupancy date 
because of the expansion of the eligible BTR 
development, the requirements in this section 
apply to each part of the eligible BTR 
development as if they were separate eligible BTR 
developments.   
 
70J BTR benefit—land tax concession 
The owner of land or part of land that is eligible 
for the BTR benefits is to be assessed for land tax 
on that land or part of land as if the taxable value 
of the land or part of land were reduced by 50%.

person in relation to the purported land tax has, 
and is taken to have always had, the same force

1 General information 
See www.legislation.vic.gov.au for Victorian Bills, Acts and current 
authorised versions of legislation and up-to-date legislative information. 
Minister's second reading speech— 
Legislative Assembly: 8 September 2005 
Legislative Council: 20 October 2005 
The long title for the Bill for this Act was "to re-enact and modernise the law 
relating to land tax, to repeal the Land Tax Act 1958, to amend the Taxation 
Administration Act 1997 and other Acts and for other purposes." 
The Land Tax Act 2005 was assented to on 29 November 2005 and came 
into operation on 1 January 2006: section 2. 
INTERPRETATION OF LEGISLATION ACT 1984 (ILA) 
Style changes 
Section 54A of the ILA authorises the making of the style changes set out in 
Schedule 1 to that Act. 
References to ILA s. 39B 
Sidenotes which cite ILA s. 39B refer to section 39B of the ILA which 
provides that where an undivided section or clause of a Schedule is amended 
by the insertion of one or more subsections or subclauses, the original section 
or clause becomes subsection or subclause (1) and is amended by the 
insertion of the expression "(1)" at the beginning of the original section or 
clause. 
Interpretation 
As from 1 January 2001, amendments to section 36 of the ILA have the 
following effects: 
• 
Headings 
All headings included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
form part of that Act.  Any heading inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  This includes headings to Parts, Divisions or Subdivisions in 
a Schedule; sections; clauses; items; tables; columns; examples; diagrams; 
notes or forms.  See section 36(1A)(2A).

• 
Examples, diagrams or notes 
All examples, diagrams or notes included in an Act which is passed on or 
after 1 January 2001 form part of that Act.  Any examples, diagrams or notes 
inserted in an Act which was passed before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed 
on or after 1 January 2001, form part of that Act.  See section 36(3A). 
• 
Punctuation 
All punctuation included in an Act which is passed on or after 1 January 2001 
forms part of that Act.  Any punctuation inserted in an Act which was passed 
before 1 January 2001, by an Act passed on or after 1 January 2001, forms 
part of that Act.  See section 36(3B). 
• 
Provision numbers 
All provision numbers included in an Act form part of that Act, whether 
inserted in the Act before, on or after 1 January 2001.  Provision numbers 
include section numbers, subsection numbers, paragraphs and subparagraphs.  
See section 36(3C). 
• 
Location of "legislative items" 
A "legislative item" is a penalty, an example or a note.  As from 13 October 
2004, a legislative item relating to a provision of an Act is taken to be at the 
foot of that provision even if it is preceded or followed by another legislative 
item that relates to that provision.  For example, if a penalty at the foot of a 
provision is followed by a note, both of these legislative items will be 
regarded as being at the foot of that provision.  See section 36B. 
• 
Other material 
Any explanatory memorandum, table of provisions, endnotes, index and 
other material printed after the Endnotes does not form part of an Act.   
See section 36(3)(3D)(3E).
