agreement) under which a person grants another person, for valuable consideration, a 
right (which may, but need not, be an exclusive right
1) to occupy premises for the 
purpose of residence; 
Note— 
An agreement under which a person grants another person, for valuable consideration, a 
right to occupy for residential purposes a building on land (such as a studio or "granny 
flat") that is located adjacent to or near the primary residence on the land and which the 
other person has exclusive access to, and possession of, is a residential tenancy 
agreement. 
rooming house means residential premises in which 2 or more rooms are available, 
for valuable consideration, for residential occupation; 
rooming house agreement means an agreement under which accommodation is 
provided (with or without meals, or other facilities or services) in a rooming house;

statutory charges; 
tenancy dispute means— 
 
(a) 
a claim under a residential tenancy agreement, a rooming house agreement, or 
an agreement collateral to a residential tenancy agreement or a rooming house 
agreement; or 
 
(b) 
a dispute between parties or former parties to a residential tenancy agreement, 
a rooming house agreement, or an agreement collateral to a residential

(2)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Residential Tenancies Act 1995—1.7.2024 
Part 1—Preliminary 
 
12 
Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002 
 
(3) 
If this Act provides that action may be taken after the expiration of a specified period 
of days, the period will be taken to be a period of clear days. 
 
(4) 
For the purposes of this Act, a residential tenancy agreement includes an agreement 
granting a corporation the right to occupy premises that are occupied, or that are 
intended to be occupied, as a place of residence by a natural person. 
 
(5) 
For the purposes of this Act— 
 
(a) 
a reference to a rooming house is taken to include a reference to a designated 
rooming house (within the meaning of Part 7 Division 1A); and 
 
(b) 
a reference to a rooming house agreement is taken to include a designated 
rooming house agreement (within the meaning of Part 7 Division 1A); and 
 
(c) 
a reference to a rooming house proprietor is taken to include a reference to a 
designated rooming house proprietor (within the meaning of Part 7 
Division 1A). 
Note— 
1 
However, it should be noted that the Act confers certain protections against intrusion on 
the premises by the landlord. Hence, even if the agreement does not, in its terms, confer 
an exclusive right to occupation, the Act will (at least in some respects) assimilate the 
right of occupation to the exclusive right conferred by a lease. 
4—Presumption of periodicity in case of short fixed terms 
 
(1) 
If a residential tenancy agreement is entered into for a short fixed term, the agreement 
is taken to be an agreement for a periodic tenancy with a period equivalent to the 
length of the fixed term unless the landlord establishes that— 
 
(a) 
the tenant genuinely wanted a tenancy ending at the end of the short fixed 
term and the term was fixed at the tenant's request; or 
 
(b) 
before the residential tenancy agreement was entered into— 
 
(i) 
the landlord gave the tenant a notice containing a warning in the 
form required by regulation; and 
 
(ii) 
the tenant signed a statement in the form required by regulation 
acknowledging that the tenant did not expect to continue in 
possession of the premises after the end of the term stated in the 
agreement. 
 
(2) 
A short fixed term is a term of 90 days or less. 
5—Application of Act 
 
(1) 
This Act does not apply to— 
 
(a) 
an agreement giving a right of occupancy in— 
 
(i) 
a hotel or motel; or 
 
(ii) 
an educational institution, college, hospital or nursing home; or

Example— 
An agreement under which a right of occupancy is given to a student 
in accommodation provided within an educational institution or 
college would not be an agreement to which this Act applies (but this 
Act would apply, subject to this Act, to an agreement under which a 
right of occupancy is given to a student in accommodation that is not 
within an educational institution or college). 
 (iii) club premises; or 
 (iv) a home for aged or disabled persons administered by an eligible 
organisation under the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act 1954 of

of that Act); or 
 (vi) a supported residential facility within the meaning of the Supported 
Residential Facilities Act 1992; or 
 (vii) prescribed premises, or premises of a prescribed class; or 
 (ab) an agreement to which the Residential Parks Act 2007 applies; or 
 
(b) 
an agreement (other than a rooming house agreement) under which a person

section 55, the application must be made within 90 days after the notice of increased 
rent is given.

the agreement; and 
 
(e) 
the nature and value of furniture, equipment and other personal property 
provided by the landlord for the tenant's use; and 
 
(f) 
the state of repair and general condition of the premises; and 
 (fa) the estimated cost of goods and services provided under any domestic 
services agreement collateral to the residential tenancy agreement; and 
 (fb) if the rent was purportedly increased under section 55(2a)—whether the 
tenant was put under undue pressure to agree to the increase; and 
 (fc) without limiting paragraph (fb), if the rent has been increased—whether the 
increase was disproportionate considering the amount of rent payable; and 
 
(g) 
other relevant matters. 
 
(3) 
If the Tribunal finds, on an application under this section, that the rent payable under a 
residential tenancy agreement is excessive, the Tribunal may, by order— 
 
(a) 
fix the rent payable for the premises and vary the agreement by reducing the 
rent payable under the agreement accordingly; and 
 
(b) 
fix a date (which cannot be before the date of the application) from which the 
variation takes effect; and 
 
(c) 
fix a period (which cannot exceed one year) for which the order is to remain

If at least two years have elapsed since a bond was given or last increased, the 
landlord may by written notice to the tenant require the tenant to increase the bond by 
a specified additional amount, within a specified period (which must be at least

(a) 
the period of notice is less than would, apart from this Act, have been 
required at law; or

the day on which the tenancy is to end is not the last day of a period of the

(1) 
If a residential tenancy is terminated by notice of termination under this Act or, in the 
case of a tenancy under which the South Australian Housing Trust is landlord, under 
the residential tenancy agreement, the landlord may apply to the Tribunal for an order 
for possession of the premises. 
Note—

make an order for possession of the premises. 
 
(3)

suspend the operation of the order for possession for up to 90 days; and 
 
(b) 
extend the operation of the residential tenancy agreement until the landlord 
obtains vacant possession of the premises from the tenant.

(3) 
A right to make any application or to seek a review under the principal Act with 
respect to any matter in existence before the relevant day, with the effect that the 
relevant proceedings would have been commenced before the Residential Tenancies 
Tribunal, will be exercised as if this Part had been in operation before the right arose, 
so that the relevant proceedings may be commenced instead before the Tribunal. 
 
(4)
