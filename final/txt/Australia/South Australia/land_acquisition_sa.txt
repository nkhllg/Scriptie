inquiry, become known to the Authority.

Land Acquisition Act 1969—25.2.2021 
Part 2—Proposal to acquire land 
 
6 
Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002 
 
(3) 
The notice of intention to acquire the land must comply with the following 
requirements: 
 
(a) 
it must define the subject land with reasonable particularity; and 
 (ab) it must set out the operation of section 26B; and 
 
(b) 
if Part 4 Division 1 applies to the proposed acquisition—it must include a 
statement that Aboriginal groups who are not registered, and have not applied 
for registration, under the law of the State or the Commonwealth as holders of 
or claimants to native title in the land but want to participate in the 
negotiations must take the necessary steps under that law to become native 
title parties in relation to the relevant land within three months after service of 
the notice; and 
 
(c) 
if— 
 
(i) 
the Authority is the Crown or an instrumentality of the Crown; and 
 
(ii) 
the Authority proposes to acquire native title; and 
 (iii) the Authority does not propose to acquire the land for the purpose of 
conferring rights or interests on someone other than the Crown or an 
instrumentality of the Crown, 
it must state that the purpose of the acquisition is to confer rights or interests 
in relation to the land on the Crown or an instrumentality of the Crown. 
 
(4) 
If the Authority changes the boundaries of the land it proposes to acquire in any 
respect, the Authority must immediately serve a notice of amendment to the notice of 
intention to acquire the land on the same persons as the notice of intention to acquire. 
 (4a) To avoid doubt, a notice under subsection (4)— 
 
(a) 
need not be given to a person in the same way as the notice of intention to 
acquire land was given to the person; and 
 
(b) 
does not constitute a new notice of intention to acquire the relevant land. 
 
(5) 
However, a notice of amendment need not be given to a person who was given notice 
of intention to acquire the land if— 
 
(a) 
the notice of intention to acquire was given because the person held an 
interest in the land and the person no longer holds that interest; or 
 
(b) 
the notice of intention to acquire was given because the person claimed to 
hold an interest in the land and— 
 
(i) 
the claim has been abandoned; or 
 
(ii) 
a court has determined the claim and found that the claimant has no 
interest in the land. 
 
(6) 
A notice of intention to acquire land does not bind the Authority to acquire the subject 
land.

land, and before the publication of a notice of acquisition in respect of the land, 
acquire the subject land by agreement.
1 
 
(2) 
Notwithstanding the fact that a notice of intention to acquire land has been served 
upon any person, the Authority may decline to proceed with the acquisition of the 
subject land. 
 
(3) 
If the Authority decides not to proceed with the acquisition of land, it must give notice 
of the decision to the same persons as the notice of intention to acquire the land but 
notice need not be given to a person who was given notice of intention to acquire the 
land if— 
 
(a) 
the notice was given because the person held an interest in the land and the 
person no longer holds that interest; or 
 
(b) 
the notice was given because the person claimed to hold an interest in the 
land and— 
 
(i) 
the claim has been abandoned; or 
 
(ii) 
a court has determined the claim and found that the claimant has no 
interest in the land. 
 (3a) To avoid doubt, a notice under subsection (3) need not be given to a person in the 
same way as the notice of intention to acquire land was given to the person. 
 
(4) 
If the Authority does not acquire land within 18 months or a longer period fixed under 
subsection (4a), it will be presumed that the Authority has decided not to proceed with 
the acquisition and the land cannot then be acquired by the Authority unless a further 
notice of intention to acquire the land is given. 
 (4a) The period for acquisition of the land may be extended as follows: 
 
(a) 
the Authority may, by agreement with the interested parties, extend the period 
by agreement; 
 
(b) 
the Supreme Court may, on application by the Authority or an interested 
party, extend the period; 
 
(c) 
in the case of a proposed acquisition of native title— 
 
(i) 
the ERD Court may, on application by the Authority or an interested 
party, extend the period; 
 
(ii) 
the Minister may, by notice in the Gazette, extend the period if 
satisfied that the extension is necessary to allow adequate time for 
negotiation. 
 
(5) 
If the Authority decides, or is presumed to have decided, not to proceed with the 
acquisition of land, a person interested in the land may, within 6 months after notice of 
the decision is given, or the decision is presumed to have been made, by written notice 
to the Authority, claim compensation.

of native title under the agreement is intended to extinguish the native title. See section 
24MD(2A) of the Native Title Act 1993 (Cwth). 
16—Notice of acquisition 
 
(1) 
Subject to this Act
1, the Authority may, at least three months after the first occasion on 
which any notice of intention to acquire was given but before the period for 
acquisition of the land comes to an end
2, publish a notice of acquisition in the Gazette. 
 
(2) 
On publication of the notice of acquisition— 
 
(a) 
the land vests in the Authority to the extent of the interest specified in the 
notice; and 
 
(b) 
a mortgage, charge, encumbrance, trust or other interest affecting the land 
(except native title) is, to the extent it affects the land subject to the 
acquisition, discharged; and 
 
(c) 
if a residual interest remains after the acquisition, the interest is modified to 
the extent required by the acquisition.
3 
 
(3) 
The land acquired under this section may be an easement, right, power, or privilege 
that did not previously exist as such in, under, over, or in connection with, land. 
 
(4) 
A notice of acquisition must define the subject land as accurately as is reasonably 
practicable. 
 
(5) 
The Authority must have the notice of acquisition published in a newspaper 
circulating generally throughout the State. 
 (5a) The Authority must also give notice of the acquisition to the same persons as the 
notice of intention to acquire the land but notice need not be given to a person who 
was given notice of intention to acquire the land if— 
 
(a) 
the notice was given because the person held an interest in the land and the 
person no longer holds that interest; or

(b) 
the notice was given because the person claimed to hold an interest in the 
land and— 
 
(i) 
the claim has been abandoned; or 
 
(ii) 
a court has determined the claim and found that the claimant has no 
interest in the land. 
 (5b) To avoid doubt, a notice under subsection (5a) need not be given to a person in the 
same way as the notice of intention to acquire land was given to the person. 
 
(6) 
If the acquisition may result in the extinguishment of the native title of persons who 
have not yet been registered under the law of the Commonwealth or the State as 
holders of, or claimants to, native title in land, general notice of the acquisition must 
be given to all persons who hold or may hold native title in the land
4 and the notice 
must include a statement of the special rights of native title holders to claim 
compensation under this Act. 
Explanatory Notes— 
1 
See in particular Division 1 of Part 4 which imposes limitations on the acquisition of 
native title in land in certain circumstances. 
2 
The period for acquisition of the land is the period of 18 months after the notice of 
intention to acquire was given (see section 15(4)) or a longer period fixed under 
section 15(4a). 
3 
The acquisition of land under this section extinguishes native title to the extent permitted 
by the Native Title Act 1993(Cwth) (see sections 24MD(2), (2A) and (3)). 
4 
For method of service see Part 5 Native Title (South Australia) Act 1994. 
17—Modification of instruments of title 
 
(1) 
The Authority shall forthwith after publication of a notice of acquisition cause a copy 
of the notice to be served on the Registrar and the Registrar shall withdraw any caveat 
entered pursuant to this Act and cause such alterations to, or endorsements upon, any 
instrument of title to the land in his possession or power (whether or not the land has 
been brought under the provisions of the Real Property Act 1886) to be made as may 
be required in consequence of the acquisition of the land. 
 
(2) 
If a notice of acquisition of native title in land is published, the Authority must give a 
copy of the notice of acquisition to any authority that maintains a register of native 
title under the law of the State or the Commonwealth. 
Part 4—Negotiation, compensation and other payments 
Division 1—Acquisition of native title in land for private purpose 
18—Application of Division 
 
(1) 
This Division applies to a proposed acquisition of native title in the following 
circumstances: 
 
(a) 
the acquisition is to be made by the Crown or an instrumentality of the Crown 
for the purpose of conferring rights or interests on a person other than the 
Crown or an instrumentality of the Crown; and 
 
(b) 
the proposed acquisition is not a prescribed private acquisition.

Part 4—Negotiation, compensation and other payments 
Division 1—Acquisition of native title in land for private purpose 
14 
Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002 
 
(2) 
A proposed acquisition of native title to which this Division applies may only proceed 
subject to this Division. 
19—Negotiation about acquisition of native title in land 
 
(1) 
If native title in land is to be acquired, the Authority must, after giving notice of 
intention to acquire land and before publishing a notice of acquisition of the land, 
negotiate in good faith with the appropriate native title parties (if any) in an attempt to 
reach agreement about the acquisition of the native title in the land. 
 
(2) 
The obligation to negotiate does not extend to matters unrelated to the effect of the 
acquisition project on the registered native title rights of the native title parties. 
 
(3) 
If any of the negotiating parties requests the ERD Court to do so, the Court must 
mediate between the parties to assist in obtaining their agreement. 
 
(4) 
If agreement is reached, the agreement must be filed in the Court. 
 
(5) 
The parties to an agreement filed in the Court under subsection (4) may direct that the 
agreement or a particular part of the agreement be kept confidential and, if such a 
direction is given, the agreement or the relevant part of the agreement is not to be 
available for inspection except by permission of the Court. 
 
(6) 
If the appropriate native title parties have made or established distinct claims or 
entitlements to native title in relation to the land to which the proposed agreement is to 
relate, the agreement may consist of— 
 
(a) 
a single agreement with all the appropriate native title parties; or 
 
(b) 
a series of agreements with one or more of the appropriate native title parties 
so that they are all party to at least one of the agreements. 
 
(7) 
In this section— 
appropriate native title parties are the native title parties registered as holders of, or 
claimants to, native title in the land on the relevant date who continue to be so 
registered throughout the course of the negotiations including such native title parties 
registered initially as claimants to native title but later registered as holders of native 
title during the course of the negotiations, but not including native title parties whose 
application for a native title declaration was made less than one month before the 
relevant date; 
relevant date means the date falling four months after notice of intention to acquire 
the land is given under section 10(2). 
20—Application for determination if no agreement 
 
(1) 
If agreement is not reached between the Authority and the native title parties within 
six months after notice of intention to acquire the land is given, any party may apply 
to the ERD Court for a resolution of the matter. 
 
(2) 
On an application under this section, the ERD Court may determine whether the 
Authority may acquire the land and, if so, the conditions on which the acquisition is to 
proceed (but a final determination of compensation cannot be made at this stage).
1 
 
(3) 
A determination may, if the parties agree— 
 
(a) 
reserve a question that is not reasonably capable of being determined 
immediately for further negotiation between the parties; or

(b) 
provide for determination of such a question by arbitration or in some other 
specified manner. 
 
(4) 
If a question is referred to arbitration or some other form of non-judicial dispute 
resolution, and procedural or other difficulties arise, the ERD Court may— 
 
(a) 
give directions to resolve the difficulties; or 
 
(b) 
remove the dispute into the ERD Court and resolve the question itself. 
 
(5) 
If, on an application under this section, the ERD Court is satisfied that the Authority 
has not negotiated in good faith, the Court must not make a determination on the 
application in favour of the Authority. 
 
(6) 
An application under this section does not prevent negotiations from continuing 
between the Authority and the native title parties and, if agreement is reached between 
them before the ERD Court makes its determination, the application lapses. 
 
(7) 
The ERD Court must make its determination under this section as quickly as 
practicable. 
Explanatory Note— 
1 
Compensation is determined under Division 2 of Part 4. 
20A—Constitution of trust 
 
(1) 
If— 
 
(a) 
negotiations under this Division lead to an agreement that an amount is to be 
paid by the Authority and held in trust under this section for those who 
ultimately establish a claim to native title in the subject land; or 
 
(b) 
a determination under this Division (by the Court or the Minister) requires 
that an amount is to be paid by the Authority and held in trust under this 
section for those who ultimately establish a claim to native title in the subject 
land, 
the relevant amount is to be paid into the ERD Court. 
 
(2) 
On receipt of an amount paid into court under this section, the ERD Court is to 
establish, by order, a trust under which the relevant amount is to be held in trust for 
those who ultimately establish a claim to native title in the subject land. 
 
(3) 
Subject to any order of the ERD Court under subsection (4), the amount held on trust 
is to be dealt with as follows: 
 
(a) 
if native title is established and compensation is awarded or agreed that is 
equal to, or greater than, the amount held in trust—that amount is to be paid 
out, in its entirety, to the holders (or former holders) of native title in the 
subject land; 
 
(b) 
if native title is established and compensation is awarded or agreed that is less 
than the amount held in trust—the compensation is to be paid out of the 
amount held on trust and the balance is to be paid to the Authority; 
 
(c) 
if a native title declaration establishes that the land was not (before the 
acquisition) subject to native title—the amount is to be paid out, in its 
entirety, to the Authority; 
 
(d) 
if—

particular case) have passed since the constitution of the trust; and 
 
(ii) 
a balance remains in the trust fund to which no native title party has 
established an entitlement; and 
 (iii) there is no claim to native title in the subject land,

(a) 
make orders for the disposition of money held on trust under this section; or 
 
(b) 
resolve any question about payment of an amount held on trust under this 
section. 
21—Criteria for making determination 
 
(1) 
In making its determination, the ERD Court must take into account the following: 
 
(a) 
the effect of the acquisition project on— 
 
(i) 
the enjoyment by the native title parties of their registered native title 
rights; and 
 
(ii) 
the way of life, culture and traditions of any of those parties; and 
 (iii) the development of the social, cultural and economic structures of 
any of those parties; and 
 (iv) the freedom of access by any of those parties to the land concerned 
and their freedom to carry out rites, ceremonies or other activities of 
cultural significance on the land in accordance with their traditions; 
and 
 
(v) 
any area or site, on the land concerned, of particular significance to 
the native title parties in accordance with their traditions; 
 
(b) 
the interests, proposals, opinions or wishes of the native title parties in 
relation to the management, use or control of the land in relation to which the 
native title parties hold or claim registered native title rights that will be 
affected by the acquisition project; 
 
(c) 
the economic or other significance of the acquisition project to Australia, to 
the State, to the area in which the land is located and to Aboriginal peoples 
who live in that area; 
 
(d) 
any public interest in the acquisition project proceeding; 
 
(e) 
any other matter the ERD Court considers relevant. 
 
(2) 
In determining the effect of the acquisition project as mentioned in subsection (1)(a), 
the ERD Court must take into account the nature and extent of— 
 
(a) 
existing non-native title rights and interests in the land; and 
 
(b) 
existing use of the land by persons other than the native title parties. 
 
(3) 
This section does not affect the operation of another law of the State or the 
Commonwealth for the preservation or protection of areas or sites of particular 
significance to Aboriginal people.

(4) 
Before making its determination, the ERD Court must ascertain whether there is 
agreement between the parties on issues relevant to the determination and, if all the 
parties consent, the ERD Court— 
 
(a) 
must take into account the agreement of the parties on issues relevant to the 
determination; and 
 
(b) 
need not take into account the matters mentioned in subsection (1) to the 
extent they raise issues on which agreement has been reached. 
22—Overruling of determinations 
 
(1) 
If the Minister considers it to be in the interests of the State or in the national interest 
to overrule a determination of the ERD Court under this Division, the Minister may, 
by notice in writing given to the ERD Court and the parties to the proceedings before 
the Court, overrule the determination and substitute another determination that might 
have been made by the Court. 
 
(2) 
The Minister cannot overrule a determination if more than two months have elapsed 
from the date of the determination. 
Division 1A—Notice to be given of certain prescribed private acquisitions 
22A—Notice on behalf of State for prescribed private acquisition 
When an Authority that is neither the Crown nor an instrumentality of the Crown is 
required to give a notice under this Act in relation to a prescribed private acquisition, 
the Authority must, on behalf of the State, give any additional notice required under 
the Native Title Act 1993 (Cwth). 
Explanatory Note— 
See section 24MD(6B). 
Division 2—Compensation 
22B—Entitlement to compensation 
 
(1) 
Subject to this Act, a person who has an alienable interest in land is entitled to 
compensation for the acquisition of the land under this Act if— 
 
(a) 
the person's interest in the land is divested or diminished by the acquisition; 
or 
 
(b) 
the enjoyment of the person's interest in the land is adversely affected by the 
acquisition. 
 
(2) 
However, the requirement under subsection (1) that an interest be alienable does not 
apply in relation to an interest consisting of native title. 
23—Negotiation of compensation 
 
(1) 
The Authority and the claimant must negotiate in good faith in relation to the 
compensation payable for the acquisition of land under this Act.

Division 2—Compensation

Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002 
 
(3) 
If a party to the negotiations holds or held, or claims to hold or to have held, native 
title in the land, and either the party or the Authority requests the ERD Court to do so, 
the Court must mediate between the parties to assist in obtaining their agreement on 
the matters at issue between them. 
 
(4) 
The Authority may offer non-monetary compensation. 
Example— 
The non-monetary compensation might take the form of a transfer of land, the provision 
of goods or services, or the carrying out of work for the re-instatement or improvement of 
land remaining in the claimant's ownership after the acquisition. 
 
(5) 
A party to the negotiations who is the holder of native title in the land may request 
non-monetary compensation, and the Authority must give due consideration to any 
such request. 
 
(6) 
The Authority's liability to pay compensation under this Act for the acquisition of land 
is reduced by the value of non-monetary compensation provided at the request of, or 
by agreement with, the person to whom the liability is owed. 
 
(7) 
The Authority must, at the request of the claimant and in accordance with any 
requirements set out in the regulations, convene a conference (a valuers conference) 
between valuers who have made a valuation of the subject land (and the Authority 
may convene such a conference at any other time the Authority considers appropriate). 
 
(8) 
The primary purpose of a valuers conference is to determine, if possible, a valuation 
of the subject land that is acceptable to both valuers (having regard to any factors that 
may affect the original valuations of the land), and to determine those matters of fact 
and opinion on which they agree and those on which they disagree, and the reasons for 
any disagreement. 
 
(9) 
Subject to this Act and the regulations, a valuers conference is to be conducted in 
accordance with procedures determined by the Authority. 
 (10) The regulations may make further provision in relation to a valuers conference 
(including, to avoid doubt, requiring a report of the valuers conference to be prepared 
and provided to the Authority and the claimant). 
23A—Offer of compensation and payment into court 
 
(1) 
Subject to this section, if the Authority gives notice of the acquisition of land, it must 
make an offer to the person or persons whom it believes to be entitled to compensation 
for the acquisition, stating the amount of compensation the Authority is prepared to 
pay. 
 (1a) However, the Authority need not make an offer under subsection (1) in the following 
circumstances: 
 
(a) 
if the Authority considers that the amount of compensation is unable to be 
determined at the time the notice of acquisition is given, in which case the 
Authority must, as soon as is reasonably practicable after the amount of 
compensation is able to be determined, make an offer in accordance with 
subsection (1); 
 
(b) 
in any other circumstances prescribed by the regulations, in which case the 
Authority must make an offer in accordance with any requirements set out in 
the regulations.

Negotiation, compensation and other payments—Part 4 
Compensation—Division 2 
Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002

(2) 
The offer must (where appropriate) differentiate between, and quantify, the 
component of compensation representing the value of the acquired land and the 
component referable to disturbance or other compensable matters. 
 
(3) 
The Authority must, within seven days after making an offer of compensation, pay the 
amount offered into the Court. 
 (3a) However, if the Authority has already paid an amount into the ERD Court under 
Division 1 in relation to the proposed acquisition, the Authority is required only to pay 
into the Court the amount (if any) by which the amount of the offer exceeds the 
amount already paid into the ERD Court. 
 
(4) 
Until compensation paid into Court under this section is applied by order of the Court, 
the money must be invested by the proper officer of the Court in an authorised trustee 
investment (bearing interest that compounds at intervals of one month or less) and the 
interest and other accretions accruing on the investment— 
 
(a) 
must be paid to— 
 
(i) 
the person who would, but for the acquisition of the land, have been 
entitled to the rents and profits of the land; or 
 
(ii) 
a body constituted under the law of the State or the Commonwealth 
as trustee for the claimants to whom the compensation is offered; or 
 
(b) 
must be dealt with in some other manner specified by the Court. 
 
(5) 
In relation to an offer of compensation made under this section, the Authority may— 
 
(a) 
if after making the offer the Authority becomes aware of information that 
negatively affects the value of the relevant land—apply to the Court for an 
order that the offer be decreased by a specified amount (and the Court may 
make such an order); or 
 
(b) 
in any case—increase the offer by a specified amount by notice to the person 
or persons to whom the original offer was made. 
 
(6) 
If an offer is decreased in accordance with subsection (5)(a), the Authority may apply 
to the Court for (and the Court may make) an order that the difference between the 
original offer and the decreased offer, together with any accrued interest, be paid to 
the Authority (whether by the claimant or the Registrar, as the case may be). 
 
(7) 
If an offer is increased in accordance with subsection (5)(b), the difference between 
the original offer and the increased offer, together with any accrued interest— 
 
(a) 
if the amount offered has been withdrawn by, or on behalf of, the 
claimant—may be paid directly to the claimant; or 
 
(b) 
if the amount offered has not been withdrawn by, or on behalf of, the 
claimant—must be paid into the Court. 
23AB—Responding to an offer of compensation 
 
(1) 
A person to whom an offer of compensation is made under section 23A must respond 
to the offer in accordance with this section. 
 
(2) 
The response must— 
 
(a) 
be made within the prescribed period; and

(b) 
be in writing; and 
 
(c) 
indicate whether the person accepts or rejects the offer; and 
 
(d) 
comply with any other requirements set out in the regulations. 
 
(3) 
A response must be made under this section whether or not an amount of money paid 
into the Court in relation to an acquisition has been withdrawn by, or on behalf of, the 
person to whom the offer is made. 
 
(4) 
If a person does not respond in accordance with this section within the prescribed 
period, any money paid into the Court under section 23A in respect of the relevant 
acquisition (being money that has not been withdrawn by, or on behalf of, the person) 
will, by force of this subsection, be paid to the Authority. 
 
(5) 
To avoid doubt, nothing in subsection (4) affects an entitlement of a person to 
compensation in respect of an acquisition of land. 
 
(6) 
Money paid to the Authority under subsection (4) will be taken not to accrue interest 
to which the person to whom the offer was made is entitled. 
 
(7) 
To avoid doubt, nothing in this section creates a contractual relationship between the 
Authority and the person to whom an offer is made. 
 
(8) 
In this section— 
Authority means the Authority who paid the relevant money into Court under 
section 23A; 
prescribed period means— 
 
(a) 
6 months from the date of the offer of compensation; or 
 
(b) 
if the Authority, on the application of the person, specifies a longer 
period—that period. 
 
(9) 
A person who is aggrieved by a decision of the Authority to refuse to specify a longer 
period under subsection (8) may refer the matter to the Court for review and, on the 
matter being so referred, the Court may make such orders as it considers necessary to 
resolve the matter. 
23AC—Reversion of compensation moneys 
 
(1) 
This section applies to an amount or amounts of money paid into the Court under 
section 23A (being an amount of money equal to the amount of compensation offered 
in respect of the acquisition of the relevant land). 
 
(2) 
Subject to this section, money to which this section applies must be withdrawn by, or 
on behalf of, the claimant within 24 months after the money is paid into the Court. 
 
(3) 
If amounts of money to which this section applies are paid into the Court on different 
dates, the period referred to in subsection (2) will be calculated from the latest date the 
money was paid into the Court. 
 
(4) 
The Authority must, not later than 30 days before the day on which money to which 
this section applies is to be paid to the Authority, give written notice to the claimant 
setting out— 
 
(a) 
the effect of this section; and 
 
(b) 
the date on which the money will be paid to the Authority; and

(5) 
If money to which this section applies is not withdrawn in accordance with 
subsection (2), the money, together with any accrued interest, will, by force of this 
subsection, be paid to the Authority (however, nothing in this subsection affects an 
entitlement of the claimant to compensation in respect of the acquisition of the 
relevant land). 
 
(6) 
Money paid to the Authority pursuant to subsection (5) will be taken not to accrue 
interest to which a claimant is entitled. 
 
(7) 
Subsection (2) does not apply to such portion of money required to give effect to any 
orders under section 26. 
 
(8) 
In this section— 
Authority means the Authority who paid the relevant money into the Court under 
section 23A. 
23B—Agreement 
 
(1) 
If agreement about compensation is reached by the negotiating parties, the Authority 
must file a copy of the agreement in the Court. 
 
(2) 
The Court may, on application by a party to an agreement filed in the Court under this 
section, make orders to give effect to the agreement. 
23BA—Settlement conference 
 
(1) 
The Authority— 
 
(a) 
may, before referring a matter to Court under section 23C; and 
 
(b) 
must, on an application by a claimant under section 23C(1a), 
convene a conference under this section (a settlement conference) in relation to the 
relevant matter. 
 
(2) 
The following provisions apply in relation to a settlement conference: 
 
(a) 
the Authority must appoint a conference coordinator to conduct the settlement 
conference; 
 
(b) 
the conference coordinator must hold qualifications prescribed by the 
regulations; 
 
(c) 
the conference coordinator must— 
 
(i) 
fix a time and place for the settlement conference; and 
 
(ii) 
advise the persons referred to in paragraph (f) of the time and place 
of the settlement conference; 
 
(d) 
the conference coordinator may, by notice in writing, give such directions as 
the coordinator considers necessary for the purposes of the settlement 
conference (including, to avoid doubt, directions to attend at the time and 
place fixed under paragraph (c)); 
 
(e) 
the Authority and the claimant must provide to each other party any valuation 
reports in relation to the matter within the period specified by the conference 
coordinator;

Maximum penalty: $2 500. 
23C—Reference of matters into court 
 
(1) 
The Authority or a claimant may refer a question arising in the course of negotiations 
into Court. 
 (1a) However, before referring a matter to Court under this section, a claimant must apply 
to the Authority to convene a settlement conference under section 23BA, and take part 
in such a conference, in relation to the matter. 
 
(2) 
On the reference of a matter into the Court, the Court may— 
 
(a) 
if of the opinion that the question should be the subject of further 
negotiation—adjourn the matter to allow further negotiation to take place; or 
 
(b) 
make any order necessary to resolve the question. 
 
(3) 
In particular— 
 
(a) 
if there is a dispute about whether the claimant is interested in the subject 
land, or the nature of the claimant's interest—the Court may, subject to 
subsection (4), declare whether the claimant has an interest in the subject land 
and, if so, the nature of the interest; and 
 
(b) 
the Court may make orders for compensation that the Court finds to be 
justified on the claim; and 
 
(c) 
the Court may make other orders that may be just in the circumstances of the 
case.

(4) 
If a claimant claims compensation on the basis that native title exists or existed in the 
subject land but the existence of the native title has not been established by a native 
title declaration, the Court will not itself proceed to determine the native title question 
but— 
 
(a) 
if the Authority does not dispute that native title exists or exists in the subject 
land as claimed—determine the claim for compensation on the basis that 
native title exists or existed as the claimant asserts; or 
 
(b) 
if the claim to native title in the subject land is disputed—defer consideration 
of the matter— 
 
(i) 
to allow the claimant a reasonable opportunity to make a native title 
claim under the appropriate law of the Commonwealth or the State; 
and 
 
(ii) 
if a native title claim is made, to allow time for the resolution of the 
claim. 
 
(5) 
If a claimant fails to avail itself of an opportunity allowed under subsection (4), the 
Court may reject the claim for compensation (but the rejection of a claim under this 
subsection does not preclude a further claim for compensation if the claimant's claim 
to hold native title in the subject land is later established). 
24—Entry into possession 
 
(1) 
Subject to this section, if the Authority acquires an interest in land that confers a right 
of possession, the Authority must, as soon as is reasonably practicable after a notice of 
acquisition is published in relation to the land, give written notice to the occupier of 
the land of the date on which the Authority will enter into possession of the land (the 
possession date), being— 
 
(a) 
in the case of land relating to a declared acquisition project—the date 
specified by the Authority (being a day on or after the date on which notice is 
given under this subsection); or 
 
(b) 
in any other case—a date not less than 90 days after the date on which the 
notice of acquisition is published. 
 
(2) 
If the Authority acquires an interest in land consisting of an easement or other interest 
that does not confer a right of possession, the Authority must, as soon as is reasonably 
practicable after a notice of acquisition is published in relation to the land, give written 
notice to the occupier of the land of the date from which the Authority may enter onto 
the land. 
 
(3) 
Subject to subsection (3a), if the relevant land is vacant at the time the notice of 
acquisition is published, the Authority may enter into possession from the date the 
notice is so published. 
 (3a) If at the time the notice of acquisition is published there are chattels or other personal 
property (not being a fixture) on vacant land, the Authority may enter into possession 
30 days after the date the notice is so published. 
 
(4) 
If an occupier of land to whom a notice was given under subsection (1) ceases to 
occupy the land before the date specified in the notice, the Authority may enter into 
possession of the relevant land from the time the occupier ceases to occupy the land.

(5) 
A notice under subsection (1) may be varied to fix an earlier or later possession date 
on the application, or with the agreement, of the person to whom the notice was given. 
 
(6) 
If an occupier to whom a notice under subsection (1) is given remains in occupation of 
the relevant land after the date on which the notice of acquisition is published, the 
occupier will be taken to occupy the land pursuant to a tenancy, the terms and 
conditions of which are as determined by the Authority from time to time. 
 (6a) Except where the Authority determines otherwise, rent is payable in relation to a 
tenancy referred to in subsection (6) from 90 days after the date on which the notice of 
acquisition is published (however, nothing in this subsection authorises the Authority 
to charge rent for the 90 days immediately following the date on which the notice of 
acquisition is published). 
 
(7) 
The terms and conditions determined by the Authority under subsection (6) must— 
 
(a) 
fix the amount of rent payable to the Authority in relation to the tenancy (not 
exceeding a reasonable market rate); and 
 
(b) 
comply with any requirements set out in the regulations. 
 (7a) To avoid doubt, the Residential Tenancies Act 1995 or the Retail and Commercial 
Leases Act 1995 (as the case requires) does not apply in relation to a tenancy referred 
to in subsection (6). 
 
(8) 
The Authority or a person to whom a notice is given under subsection (1) may refer 
1 or more of the following matters into the Court: 
 
(a) 
a refusal by the Authority to fix a later possession date; 
 
(b) 
a matter relating to the amount of rent payable in relation to the relevant 
tenancy; 
 
(c) 
a matter relating to any other term or condition of the relevant tenancy 
determined under subsection (6). 
 (8a) A matter referred to in subsection (8)(a) may only be referred into the Court within a 
period of 60 days after— 
 
(a) 
the date on which the notice of acquisition is published; or 
 
(b) 
the date on which written notice of the possession date is given to a person 
under subsection (1), 
whichever is the later. 
 (8b) Subsection (8) does not apply to, or in relation to, a declared acquisition project. 
 
(9) 
On the reference of a matter into the Court, the Court may— 
 
(a) 
if of the opinion that the question should be the subject of further 
negotiation—adjourn the matter to allow further negotiation to take place; or 
 
(b) 
make such orders as the Court considers appropriate to resolve the matter 
(including, to avoid doubt, orders fixing the amount of rent payable in 
relation to the relevant tenancy). 
 (10) The Authority may enter into possession of the relevant land on or after the possession 
date despite the commencement of proceedings under this section.

 (11) Without limiting the ways in which the Authority may recover rent owed to the 
Authority, the Authority may deduct rent owed by a person to the Authority under this 
section from compensation payable to the person under this Act. 
 (12) Despite any other Act or law, the Authority is not liable for injury, damage or loss 
occurring on, or in relation to, land acquired under this Act prior to the Authority 
entering into possession of the land. 
 (13) For the purposes of this section, land will be taken to be vacant at a particular time if 
the land— 
 
(a) 
is residential land on which no person is lawfully residing at the time; or 
 
(b) 
is non-residential land that is not genuinely being used for income producing 
purposes at the time; or 
 
(c) 
is primary production land that is not actively being used for grazing, 
cropping, horticultural, horse keeping, intensive animal keeping, animal 
husbandry or other primary production purposes at the time; or 
 
(d) 
is land, or land of a class, prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of 
this paragraph. 
 (14) For the purposes of this section, the storage of chattels or other personal property on 
land by a person does not, of itself, constitute the person residing on the property, the 
use of the property for income producing purposes or the use of the land for a primary 
production purpose. 
 (15) In this section— 
declared acquisition project means an acquisition project, or acquisition project of a 
class, declared by the relevant Minister by notice in the Gazette to be included in the 
ambit of this definition; 
relevant Minister means— 
 
(a) 
in the case of an acquisition of land authorised by a special Act, the 
administration of which is committed to a Minister—that Minister; or 
 
(b) 
in any other case—the Minister. 
24A—Court orders in relation to entry into possession etc 
 
(1) 
The Authority may apply to the Court for 1 or more of the following orders: 
 
(a) 
if the Authority is entitled to enter into possession of land acquired under this 
Act—an order that a person be ejected from that land; 
 
(b) 
an order that a person who owes rent to the Authority under section 24 pay 
the rent owed to the Authority; 
 
(c) 
such other orders as the Authority considers appropriate.

26 
Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002 
25—Principles of compensation 
 
(1) 
The compensation payable under this Act in respect of the acquisition of land shall be 
determined according to the following principles: 
 
(a) 
the compensation payable to a claimant shall be such as adequately to 
compensate him for any loss that he has suffered by reason of the acquisition 
of the land; and 
 
(b) 
in assessing the amount referred to in paragraph (a) of this section 
consideration may be given to— 
 
(i) 
the actual value of the subject land; and 
 
(ii) 
the loss occasioned by reason of severance, disturbance or injurious 
affection; and 
 
(c) 
compensation shall be fixed as at the date of acquisition of the land; and 
 
(d) 
where the claimant's interest in the subject land was liable to expire or be 
determined, any reasonable prospect of renewal or continuation of the interest 
must be taken into account; and 
 
(e) 
any special suitability or adaptability of the land for any purpose shall not be 
taken into account if it could be applied to that purpose in pursuance only of 
statute, or if the suitability or adaptability is peculiar to the purposes or 
requirements of a particular person or of any Governmental or local 
governing authority but any bona fide offer to acquire the land made before 
the passing of the special Act shall be taken into account; and 
 
(f) 
where the value of the land is enhanced by reason of its use, or the use of any 
premises on the land, in a manner that may be restrained by any court, or is 
contrary to law, or is detrimental to the health of any persons, the amount of 
that enhancement shall not be taken into account; and 
 
(g) 
no allowance shall be made on account of the fact that the acquisition is 
effected without the consent, or against the will, of any person; and 
 
(h) 
no allowance shall be made for any enhancement or diminution in the value 
of the land in consequence of— 
 
(a) 
the passing of the special Act; or 
 
(b) 
the acquisition under this Act of any other land; or 
 
(c) 
any proposed or expected development of the land after its 
acquisition; and 
 
(i) 
where the land is, and but for acquisition would continue to be, devoted to a 
particular purpose, and there is no general demand or market for land devoted 
to that purpose, the compensation may, if reinstatement in some other place is 
bona fide intended, be assessed on the basis of the reasonable cost of 
equivalent reinstatement; and 
 
(j) 
allowance shall be made in favour of the Authority for any enhancement in 
value of land adjoining the subject land in which the claimant is interested by 
reason of development of the land after its acquisition, but in no case shall the 
claimant be liable to make any payment to the Authority in respect of such 
enhancement in value; and

(4) 
The following provisions apply in relation to the payment of compensation under this 
section: 
 
(a) 
the Authority and the interest holder must negotiate in good faith in relation 
to the compensation; 
 
(b) 
the Authority may offer non-monetary compensation to the interest holder 
(including, to avoid doubt, compensation consisting of relocation of any 
infrastructure affected by the acquisition); 
 
(c) 
the Authority's liability to pay compensation under this section is reduced by 
the value of any non-monetary compensation provided at the request of, or by 
agreement with, the interest holder; 
 
(d) 
the amount of compensation payable under this section is to be determined on 
the basis that the interest holder is to be compensated for loss occasioned by 
reason of disturbance (and regard is to be had to such of the principles set out 
in section 25 as may be relevant to such a loss); 
 
(e) 
the Authority or the interest holder may refer a question arising in the course 
of negotiations into Court (and the matter may be dealt with as if it had been a 
matter referred into Court under section 23C); 
 
(f) 
compensation under this section may be paid directly to the interest holder in 
a manner determined by the Authority; 
 
(g) 
the payment of compensation must comply with any other requirements set 
out in the regulations. 
 
(5) 
In this section— 
prescribed interest, in underground land, means—

ownership of a lawful well that provides access to underground water in the 
underground land, and any underground infrastructure associated with the 
well; or 
 
(b) 
a right to take underground water from the underground land by means of 
such a well, 
in each case being an interest existing immediately before a notice of acquisition is 
published in relation to the underground land; 
underground water has the same meaning as in the Natural Resources Management 
Act 2004; 
well has the same meaning as in the Natural Resources Management Act 2004 and 
includes, to avoid doubt, a bore.

(2) 
If after the expiration of three months from the day on which a notice was served

For method of service on persons who hold or may hold native title in land see Part 5 
Native Title (South Australia) Act 1994. 
32—Persons of limited juristic capacity 
 
(1) 
Where the juristic capacity of a claimant (not being a body corporate) is limited in any 
way, any amount of compensation payable in respect of land in which he was 
interested must be approved by the Court. 
 
(2) 
If an amount of compensation is not approved as required by subsection (1) of this 
section, an application may, notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, be made 
at any time to the Court by or on behalf of the claimant, and the Court may order the 
Authority to pay further compensation to the claimant. 
33—Interest 
Where the Authority agrees with a claimant or is ordered to pay a greater amount of 
compensation than the amount paid into Court in respect of the acquisition of any 
land, the Authority must also pay the additional sum that would have accrued 
(whether as interest or otherwise) had the amount agreed or ordered been paid into 
Court instead.

appropriate to do so, take into consideration— 
 
(a) 
the amount of compensation awarded by the Court as compared with the 
amount (if any) offered by the Authority; and

from, or been affected by— 
 
(i) 
unreasonable conduct on the part of the claimant or the Authority; or 
 
(ii) 
an excessive claim by the claimant or unduly depressed offer by the 
Authority; or 
 (iii) a failure on the part of the Authority or the claimant to negotiate in 
good faith. 
36A—Recovery of compensation from Authority

under section 12A of the principal Act before the relevant day.
