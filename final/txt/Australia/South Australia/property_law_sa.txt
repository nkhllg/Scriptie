arising out of the doctrine of election or otherwise, the court may declare that any of 
the parties to the action are trustees of the land, or any part thereof, within the 
meaning of the Trustee Act 1936 or may declare that the interests of unborn persons 
who might claim under any party to the action, or under the will or voluntary 
settlement of any person deceased who was during his lifetime a party to the contract 
or transactions concerning which the judgment is given, are the interests of persons 
who, on coming into existence, would be trustees within the meaning of the Trustee 
Act 1936; and thereupon the court may make a vesting order relating to the rights of 
those persons, born and unborn, as if they had been trustees.

23—Gift not to be avoided by illegal stipulation attached thereto

of such sum as is hereinafter mentioned, that is to say— 
 
(a) 
in the case of an annual sum charged on the land, or of a capital sum charged 
on a determinable interest in the land, the sum to be paid into court shall be of

otherwise provide for that charge; and 
 
(b) 
in any other case of capital money charged on the land, the sum to be paid 
into court shall be of an amount sufficient to meet the incumbrance and any 
interest due thereon 
but in either case there shall also be paid into court such additional amount as the 
court considers will be sufficient to meet the contingency of further costs, expenses 
and interest, and any other contingency, except depreciation of investments, not 
exceeding one-tenth part of the original amount to be paid in, unless the court for 
special reason thinks fit to require a larger additional amount.

the court which was confined to the land then sold or exchanged.

On any application under this section the court may, if it thinks fit, as respects any 
vendor or purchaser, dispense with the service of any notice which under this Act or 
otherwise would apart from this subsection be required to be served on the vendor or 
purchaser. 
 
(5) 
After notice served on the persons interested in or entitled to the money or fund in 
court, the court may direct payment or transfer thereof to the persons entitled to 
receive or give a discharge for the same on such terms as to delivering up of deeds or 
other documents or on such other terms as the court thinks fit, and generally may give 
directions respecting the application or distribution of the capital or income thereof.

land the court may, in favour of a purchaser, make a vesting order conveying the land 
or may appoint a person to convey the land, or may create and vest in the mortgagee a 
legal estate in the land to enable him to carry out the sale as the case requires, in like 
manner as if the mortgage had been made by way of legal mortgage, but without 
prejudice to any incumbrance having priority to the equitable mortgage unless the 
incumbrancer consents to the sale.

redemption, and, notwithstanding that—

the mortgagee or any person so interested does not appear in the action, 
and without allowing any time for redemption or for payment of any mortgage money,

expenses of sale and to secure performance of the terms.

any defendant, and may give such directions as it thinks fit respecting the costs of the

vesting order conveying the mortgaged property, or appoint a person to do so, subject 
or not to any incumbrance, as the court thinks fit; or, in the case of an equitable 
mortgage, may create and vest in the mortgagee a legal estate to enable him to carry 
out the sale in like manner as if the mortgage had been made by way of legal 
mortgage.

the mortgagee, instead of reconveying or surrendering, to assign the mortgage debt 
and convey the mortgaged property, or in the case of registered land to transfer the 
mortgage, to any third person, as the mortgagor directs; and the mortgagee shall be 
bound to assign, convey, or transfer accordingly.

62—Court may order vesting of interests 
 
(1) 
If, 80 years or more after the date of a disposition of property, there remain interests in 
the property that have not vested, the court may, on application under this section, 
vary the terms of the disposition so that the interests vest immediately. 
 
(2) 
The court may, on application under this section, vary the terms of a disposition of 
property so that interests that cannot vest, or are unlikely to vest, within 80 years after 
the date of the disposition, will vest within that period. 
 
(3) 
If a disposition provides for the accumulation, or partial accumulation, of income from 
property over a period that will or may terminate 80 years or more after the date of the 
disposition, the court may, on application under this section, vary the terms of the 
disposition so that both capital and income will vest within 80 years from the date of 
the disposition. 
 
(4)

a person who would, assuming the existence and continuance of lineal issue, 
be the ancestor of a person (as yet unborn) who would have an actual or 
potential interest in property subject to the disposition.

dividends includes (besides dividends strictly so called) all payments made by the 
name of dividends, bonus, or otherwise out of the revenue of trading or other public 
companies, divisible between all or any of the members of such respective companies, 
whether such payments shall be usually made or declared at any fixed times or 
otherwise; and all such divisible revenue shall, for the purposes of this Act, be deemed 
to have accrued by equal daily increment during and within the period for or in respect 
of which the payment of the same revenue shall be declared or expressed to be made; 
but the said word dividend does not include payments in the nature of a return or 
reimbursement of capital; 
rent includes all periodical payments or renderings in lieu of or in the nature of rent. 
64—Apportionment of rents in respect of time 
All rent, annuities, dividends, and other periodical payments in the nature of income 
(whether reserved or made payable under an instrument in writing, or otherwise) shall, 
like interest on money lent, be considered as accruing from day to day, and shall be 
apportionable in respect of time accordingly. 
65—When apportioned part payable or recoverable 
The apportioned part of any such rent, annuity, dividend, or other payment shall be 
payable or recoverable, in the case of a continuing rent, annuity, or other such 
payment, when the entire portion of which such apportioned part shall form part shall 
become due and payable, and not before; and in the case of a rent, annuity, or other 
such payment determined by re-entry, death, or otherwise when the next entire portion 
of the same would have been payable if the same had not so determined, and not 
before.

All persons and their respective executors, administrators, and assigns, and also the 
executors, administrators, and assigns respectively of persons whose interests 
determine with their own deaths, shall have such or the same remedies at law and in 
equity for recovering such apportioned parts as aforesaid when payable (allowing 
proportionate parts of all just allowances) as they respectively would have had for 
recovering such entire portions as aforesaid if entitled thereto respectively: Provided 
that persons liable to pay rent reserved out of or charged on lands or other 
hereditaments of any tenure and the same lands or other hereditaments shall not be 
resorted to for any such apportioned part forming part of an entire or continuing rent 
as aforesaid specifically; but the entire or continuing rent, including such apportioned 
part, shall be recovered and received by the person who, if the rent had not been 
apportionable under this Part, or otherwise, would have been entitled to such entire or 
continuing rent; and such apportioned part shall be recoverable from such person by 
the executors or other parties entitled under this Part to the same by action at law or in

Part 8—Partition 
69—Power to order partition or sale instead of partition 
 
(1) 
On any application for partition the court may order a partition of the said land or 
other property, and may give all necessary or proper consequential directions. 
 
(2) 
On any such application if it appears to the court that, by reason of the nature of the 
property, or of the number of the parties interested or presumptively interested therein, 
or of the absence or disability of some of those parties, or of any other circumstance, a 
sale of the property and a distribution of the proceeds would be more beneficial for the 
parties interested than a division of the property between or among them, the court 
may, if it thinks fit, on the request of any of the parties interested, and notwithstanding 
the absence, dissent or disability of any others of them, direct a sale of the property 
accordingly, and may give all necessary or proper consequential directions. 
70—Sale on application of certain proportion of parties interested 
On any application for partition, if the party or parties interested individually or 
collectively, to the extent of one moiety or upwards in the property, request the court 
to direct a sale of the property and a distribution of the proceeds, instead of a division 
of the property between or among the parties interested, the court shall, unless it sees 
good reason to the contrary, direct a sale of the property accordingly, and shall give all 
necessary or proper consequential directions.

71—As to purchase of share of party desiring sale 
On any application for partition, if any party interested in the property requests the 
court to direct a sale of the property and a distribution of the proceeds instead of a 
division of the property between or among the parties interested, the court may, if it 
thinks fit, unless the other parties interested in the property, or some of them, 
undertake to purchase the share of the party requesting a sale, direct a sale of the 
property, and give all necessary or proper consequential directions, and in case of such 
undertaking being given the court may order a valuation of the share of the party 
requesting a sale in such manner as the court thinks fit, and may give all necessary or 
proper consequential directions. 
72—Notice to interested parties 
 
(1) 
Notice of every application for partition shall be served on all other parties interested 
in the property unless the court otherwise directs. 
 
(2) 
Any party served with notice may attend the proceedings. 
 
(3) 
The court may direct such inquiries as to the nature of the property and the persons 
interested therein and other matters as it thinks necessary or proper with a view to an 
order for partition or sale. 
 
(4) 
If it appears to the court that notice of the application cannot be served on all parties 
interested in the property, or cannot be served without undue delay or expense 
disproportionate to the value of the property the court may dispense with the service 
of notice of the application on any person or class of person specified in the order 
dispensing with service. 
 
(5) 
The court may direct advertisements to be published in such manner as the court 
thinks fit, calling on all persons interested to come in and establish their claims within 
a time limited by the advertisements. 
 
(6) 
If an order is made by the court dispensing with service or for the publication of 
advertisements, all parties interested shall be bound by the proceedings in the 
application, whether they are within or without the jurisdiction of the court (including 
persons under any disability) as if they had been served with notice. 
73—Proceedings where service is dispensed with 
Where an order is made under the preceding section dispensing with service, and 
property is sold by order of the court, the following provisions shall have effect, 
subject to any contrary order of the court: 
 
(a) 
the proceeds of sale shall be paid into court to abide the further order of the 
court; 
 
(b) 
the court shall, by order, fix a time, at the expiration of which the proceeds 
will be distributed, and may from time to time, by further order, extend that 
time; 
 
(c) 
the court shall direct such notices to be given by advertisements or otherwise 
as it thinks best adapted for notifying to any persons who may not have 
previously come in and established their claims, the fact of the sale, the time 
of the intended distribution, and the time within which a claim to participate 
in the proceeds must be made;

if at the expiration of the time so fixed or extended the interests of all the 
persons interested have been ascertained, the court shall distribute the 
proceeds in accordance with the rights of those persons; 
 
(e) 
if at the expiration of the time so fixed or extended the interests of all the 
persons interested have not been ascertained, and it appears to the court that 
they cannot be ascertained, or cannot be ascertained without undue delay or 
expense disproportionate to the value of the property or of the unascertained 
interest, the court shall distribute the proceeds in such manner as appears to 
the court to be most in accordance with the rights of the persons whose claims 
to participate in the proceeds have been established, whether all those persons 
are or are not before the court, and with such reservations (if any) as to the 
court may seem fit in favour of any other persons (whether ascertained or not) 
who may appear from the evidence before the court to have any prima facie 
rights which ought to be so provided for, although such rights may not have 
been fully established, but to the exclusion of all other persons, and thereupon 
all such other persons shall by virtue of this Part be excluded from 
participation in those proceeds on the distribution thereof, but 
notwithstanding the distribution any excluded person may recover from any 
participating person any portion received by him of the share of the excluded 
person. 
74—Authority for parties interested to bid 
On any sale under this Part the court may, if it thinks fit, allow any of the parties 
interested in the property to bid at the sale, on such terms as to non-payment of 
deposit, or as to setting off or accounting for the purchase-money, or any part thereof, 
instead of paying the same, or as to any other matters as to the court seem reasonable. 
75—Court to declare what parties are trustees of lands comprised in any suit, 
and as to the interests of persons unborn 
In any application for partition where an order shall be made by the court for the sale 
instead of the partition of the property, it shall be lawful for the court to declare that 
any of the parties are trustees of such property or any part thereof within the meaning 
of this Part, or to declare concerning the interests of unborn persons who might claim 
under any party or under the will or voluntary settlement of any person deceased who 
was during his lifetime a party to the transaction concerning which such order is made, 
that such interests of unborn persons are the interests of persons who, upon coming 
into existence, would be trustees within the meaning of this Part, and thereupon it 
shall be lawful for the court to make such order or orders as to the estates, rights, and 
interests of such persons, born or unborn, as the said court might, under the provisions 
of this Part make concerning the estates, rights, and interests of trustees born or 
unborn.

76—Payment and application of moneys arising from settled land 
All moneys to be received on any sale effected under the authority of this Part, when 
the property sold is settled land, may, if the court shall think fit be paid to any trustees 
of whom it shall approve, or otherwise the same shall be paid into court, and such 
money shall be applied as the court shall from time to time direct to some one or more 
of the following purposes, namely: 
 
(a) 
The discharge or redemption of any incumbrance affecting the hereditaments 
in respect of which such money was paid, or affecting any other 
hereditaments, subject to the same uses as trusts; or

The application of the money in manner aforesaid may, if the court shall so direct, be 
made by the trustees (if any) without any application to the court, or otherwise upon 
an order of the court, upon the application of the person who would be entitled to the 
possession or the receipt of the rents and profits of the land if the money had been 
invested in the purchase of land. 
78—Until money directed to be applied it is to be invested and dividends to be 
paid to parties entitled 
Until the money shall be directed by the court to be applied as aforesaid, the same 
shall be invested as the court shall direct in some or one of the investments in which 
money under the control of the court is for the time being authorised to be invested, 
and the interest and dividends of such investments shall be paid to the person who 
would have been entitled to the rents and profits of the land if the money had been 
invested in the purchase of land. 
79—Court may direct application of money in respect of leases or reversions as 
may appear just 
Where any purchase money paid into court under the provisions of this Part shall have 
been paid in respect of any lease or any estate in lands less than the whole fee simple 
thereof, or of any reversion dependent on any such lease or estate, the court may, on 
the application of any party interested in such money, order that the same shall be laid 
out, invested, accumulated, and paid in such manner as the court may consider will 
give to the parties interested in such money the same benefit therefrom as they might 
lawfully have had from the lease, estate, or reversion in respect of which such money 
shall have been paid, or as near thereto as may be. 
80—Interpretation of settled land 
 
(1) 
The term settled land, as used in this Part, shall signify all hereditaments of any 
tenure, and all estates or interest in any such hereditaments, which are or shall be the 
subject of a settlement; and for the purpose of this Part a tenant in tail after possibility 
of issue extinct, shall be deemed to be a tenant for life.

be governed by the state of facts, and by trusts or limitations of the settlement at the 
time of the said settlement taking effect.

If on any application for partition two or more sales are made and if any person who 
has by virtue of this Part been excluded from participation in the proceeds of any of 
those sales establishes his claim to participate in the proceeds of a subsequent sale, the 
shares of the other persons interested in the proceeds of the subsequent sale shall abate 
to the extent (if any) to which they were increased by the non-participation of the 
excluded person in the proceeds of the previous sale, and shall to that extent be 
applied in or towards payment to that person of the share to which he would have been 
entitled in the proceeds of the previous sale if his claim thereto had been established in 
due time.

In an application for partition a request for sale may be made or an undertaking to 
purchase given on the part of an infant, person of unsound mind, or person under any 
other disability, by the next friend, guardian, committee (if so authorised by order of 
the court) or other person authorised to act on behalf of the person under such 
disability, but the court shall not be bound to comply with any such request or 
undertaking on the part of an infant unless it appears that the sale or purchase will be 
for his benefit. 
83—Application for partition to include application for sale and distribution of 
the proceeds 
In an application for partition it shall be sufficient to claim a sale and distribution of 
the proceeds, and it shall not be necessary to claim a partition.

contracted to sell land, shall be deemed a trustee 
Where a person having contracted in writing to sell land dies without having conveyed 
the land in pursuance of his contract, and the consideration for the sale has been paid 
or satisfied in his lifetime, or after his decease, or the person entitled to receive the 
consideration money or such part thereof as may remain unsatisfied, is willing to 
receive the same, and there is no dispute or question as to the making of the contract, 
or as to the right of the purchaser of the land so agreed to be sold to demand specific 
performance of such contract, and the court shall be satisfied that the only impediment 
to the performance thereof arises from the fact that the legal estate in the land has 
become vested in the representative or devisee of the deceased vendor, who is an 
infant, or a mentally incapacitated person, the court may make an order declaring the 
representative or devisee, as the case may be, of the deceased vendor to be a trustee of 
the land contracted to be sold, and such representative or devisee shall thereupon be 
deemed to be a trustee thereof within the meaning of Trustee Act 1936 and at the same 
time or subsequently the court may order that the land shall vest in such person in 
such manner and for such estate as the court may direct, and may give directions as to

appointment of a new trustee or new trustees thereof, and for the investment of the 
moneys payable under any such policy. In default of any such appointment of a 
trustee, such policy, immediately on its being effected, shall vest in the insured and his 
or her legal personal representatives, in trust for the purposes aforesaid. If, at the time 
of the death of the insured, or at any time afterwards, there shall be no trustee, or it 
shall be expedient to appoint a new trustee or new trustees, a trustee or trustees, or a 
new trustee or new trustees may be appointed by the court.

personal representative of the insured, shall be a discharge to the office for the sum 
secured by the policy, or for the value thereof, in whole or in part.
