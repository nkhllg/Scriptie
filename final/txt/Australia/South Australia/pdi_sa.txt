(4) 
If an area of land that is, or is included in, a character preservation area under a 
character preservation law ceases to be, or to be included in, a character preservation 
area, the area of land will, at the time of the cessation, by force of this subsection, be 
taken to be an environment and food production area established under this section.

grant development authorisation to the development unless the Commission 
concurs in the granting of the authorisation;

development authorisation to the development unless the council for the area 
where the proposed development is situated concurs in the granting of the 
authorisation;

no appeal lies against a refusal by a relevant authority to grant development 
authorisation to the development or a refusal by the Commission or a council 
to concur in the granting of such an authorisation; 
 
(d) 
if the proposed development will create additional allotments to be used for 
residential development, the relevant authority must refuse to grant 
development authorisation in relation to the proposed development;

a development authorisation granted in relation to the proposed development 
will be taken to be subject to the condition that the additional allotments 
created will not be used for residential development.

that areas of rural, landscape, environmental or food production significance within 
Greater Adelaide should be protected from urban encroachment.

production areas does not affect the operation of this Act, a Mining Act or any other 
Act, except as provided in subsection (5). 
 
(8) 
Subject to this section, the Commission may, from time to time, by notice published in 
the Gazette and on the SA planning portal, vary an environment and food production

(1) 
The primary object of this Act is to support and enhance the State's liveability and 
prosperity in ways that are ecologically sustainable and meet the needs and 
expectations, and reflect the diversity, of the State's communities by creating an 
effective, efficient and enabling planning system, linked with other laws, that— 
 
(a) 
promotes and facilitates development, and the integrated delivery and 
management of infrastructure and public spaces and facilities, consistent with 
planning principles and policies; and 
 
(b) 
provides a scheme for community participation in relation to the initiation and 
development of planning policies and strategies. 
 
(2) 
In association with the object referred to subsection (1), the scheme established by this 
Act is intended to— 
 
(a) 
be based on policies, processes and practices that are designed to be simple 
and easily understood and that provide consistency in interpretation and 
application; and 
 
(b) 
enable people who use or interact with the planning system to access planning 
information, and to undertake processes and transactions, by digital means; 
and 
 
(c) 
promote certainty for people and bodies proposing to undertake development 
while at the same time providing scope for innovation; and 
 
(d) 
promote high standards for the built environment through an emphasis on 
design quality in policies, processes and practices, including by providing for 
policies and principles that support or promote universal design for the 
benefit of people with differing needs and capabilities; and 
 
(e) 
promote safe and efficient construction through cost-effective technical 
requirements that form part of a national scheme of construction rules and 
product accreditation; and 
 
(f) 
provide financial mechanisms, incentives and value-capture schemes that 
support development and that can be used to capitalise on investment 
opportunities; and 
 
(g) 
promote cooperation, collaboration and policy integration between and 
among State government agencies and local government bodies.

Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002 
14—Principles of good planning 
In seeking to further the objects of this Act, regard should be given to the following 
principles that relate to the planning system established by this Act (insofar as may be 
reasonably practicable and relevant in the circumstances): 
 
(a) 
long-term focus principles as follows: 
 
(i) 
policy frameworks should be based around long-term priorities, be 
ecologically sound, and seek to promote equity between present and 
future generations; 
 
(ii) 
policy frameworks should be able to respond to emerging challenges 
and cumulative impacts identified by monitoring, benchmarking and 
evaluation programs; 
 
(b) 
urban renewal principles as follows: 
 
(i) 
preference should be given to accommodating expected future 
growth of cities and towns through the logical consolidation and 
redevelopment of existing urban areas; 
 
(ii) 
the encroachment of urban areas on areas of rural, landscape or 
environmental significance is to be avoided other than in exceptional 
circumstances; 
 (iii) urban renewal should seek to make the best use (as appropriate) of 
underlying or latent potential associated with land, buildings and 
infrastructure; 
 
(c) 
high-quality design principles as follows: 
 
(i) 
development should be designed to reflect local setting and context, 
to have a distinctive identity that responds to the existing character of 
its locality, and to strike a balance between built form, infrastructure 
and public realm; 
 
(ii) 
built form should be durable, designed to be adaptive (including in 
relation to the reuse of buildings or parts of buildings) and 
compatible with relevant public realm; 
 (iii) public realm should be designed to be used, accessible, and 
appropriately landscaped and vegetated; 
 (iv) built form and the public realm should be designed to be inclusive 
and accessible to people with differing needs and capabilities 
(including through the serious consideration of universal design 
practices); 
 
(v) 
cities and towns should be planned and designed to be 
well-connected in ways that facilitate the safe, secure and effective 
movement of people within and through them; 
 
(d) 
activation and liveability principles as follows: 
 
(i) 
planning and design should promote mixed use neighbourhoods and 
buildings that support diverse economic and social activities;

developed to support active and healthy lifestyles and to cater for a 
diverse range of cultural and social activities; 
 
(e) 
sustainability principles as follows: 
 
(i) 
cities and towns should be planned, designed and developed to be 
sustainable; 
 
(ii) 
particular effort should be focussed on achieving energy efficient 
urban environments that address the implications of climate change; 
 (iii) policies and practices should promote sustainable resource use, reuse 
and renewal and minimise the impact of human activities on natural 
systems that support life and biodiversity; 
 
(f) 
investment facilitation principles as follows: 
 
(i) 
planning and design should be undertaken with a view to 
strengthening the economic prosperity of the State and facilitating 
proposals that foster employment growth; 
 
(ii) 
the achievement of good planning outcomes should be facilitated by 
coordinated approaches that promote public and private investment 
towards common goals; 
 
(g) 
integrated delivery principles as follows: 
 
(i) 
policies, including those arising outside the planning system, should 
be coordinated to ensure the efficient and effective achievement of 
planning outcomes; 
 
(ii) 
planning, design and development should promote integrated 
transport connections and ensure equitable access to services and 
amenities; 
 (iii) any upgrade of, or improvement to, infrastructure or public spaces or 
facilities should be coordinated with related development.

participation methods should be appropriate having regard to the significance 
and likely impact of relevant policies and strategies;

the Commission is satisfied that the alternative way is at least effective in achieving 
public consultation as the requirement under the charter.

liabilities (and a failure to comply with the charter does not give rise to a right of 
action or invalidate any decision or process under this Act unless the failure is under a

(4) 
Subject to subsection (6), if, at the expiration of 28 days from the day on which the 
charter or an amendment was referred to the ERD Committee, the ERD Committee 
has not made a resolution under subsection (3), it will be conclusively presumed that 
the ERD Committee does not object to the charter or the amendment (as the case may 
be) and does not propose to suggest any amendments. 
 
(5) 
Subject to subsection (6), if the period of 28 days referred to in subsection (4) would, 
but for this subsection, expire in a particular case between 15 December in 1 year and 
15 January in the next year (both days inclusive), the period applying for the purposes 
of subsection (4) will be extended on the basis that any days falling on or between 
those 2 dates will not be taken into account for the purposes of calculating the period 
that applies under subsection (4).

not object to the charter as originally made, or resolve to object to the 
charter; and

charter or the amendment (as the case may be) must be laid before both Houses of 
Parliament. 
 
(9) 
If either House of Parliament passes a resolution disallowing the charter or an 
amendment laid before it under subsection (8), then the charter or the amendment (as 
the case may be) will cease to have effect (and, in the case of an amendment, the 
charter will, from that time, apply as if it had not been amended by that amendment). 
 (10) A resolution is not effective for the purposes of subsection (9) unless passed in

rules should be based on clear performance outcomes, may include deemed to 
satisfy requirements (including requirements that can be met in a variety of 
ways), and should seek to apply excellence in design practices and 
techniques; 
 
(c) 
rules and standards should be proportionate, suited to relevant conditions, and 
insofar as is reasonably practicable and appropriate, seek to minimise 
regulatory burdens; 
 
(d) 
rules should aim to achieve consistency while providing for local variations 
that reflect special or unique character at the local level; 
 
(e) 
rules and standards must seek to protect the environment and the pursuit of 
ecologically sustainable development; 
 
(f) 
any other principles prescribed by the regulations. 
 
(2)

(2) 
Any of the following grounds apply for the purposes of subsection (1)(h): 
 
(a) 
the Minister considers that the proposed development is of significance to the 
State because, in the opinion of the Minister— 
 
(i) 
the development is of major social, economic or environmental 
importance; or 
 
(ii) 
the development involves benefits, impacts or risks that are of 
significance to the State; or 
 (iii) the cumulative effect of the development, when considered in 
conjunction with any other development, project or activity already 
being undertaken or carried on, or proposed to be undertaken or 
carried on, at or within the vicinity of the relevant site, gives rise to 
issues that are of significance to the State; or

 (iv) the development is directly related to— 
 (A) a development that has already been called in by the 
Minister under this section; or 
 
(B) 
a development that is considered by the Minister as being of 
significance to the State; 
 
(b) 
the Minister considers that the proposed development— 
 
(i) 
would have a significant impact on a matter arising under another 
Act; or 
 
(ii) 
will require assessment or approval under another Act as well as this 
Act; 
 
(c) 
the Minister considers that the proposed development would have a 
significant impact beyond the boundaries of a particular planning region or a 
particular council; 
 
(d) 
the Minister considers that the proposed development may have a significant 
impact on an aspect of a precinct under Part 2B of the Urban Renewal 
Act 1995; 
 
(e) 
an assessment panel appointed by a council or a joint planning board, or a 
regional assessment panel, has (in the opinion of the Minister) failed to deal 
with an application for development authorisation within a reasonable period; 
 
(f) 
the proposed development involves land situated in more than 1 planning 
region or the area of more than 1 council; 
 
(g) 
the Minister considers that it is otherwise necessary or appropriate for the 
proper assessment of the proposed development that the proposed 
development be assessed by the Commission. 
 
(3) 
If the Minister acts under subsection (1)(h)— 
 
(a) 
a relevant authority already acting in relation to the proposed development 
under another paragraph of subsection (1) must, at the request of the 
Commission, provide the Commission with a report relating to any 
application for development authorisation that has been under consideration 
by the relevant authority; and 
 
(b) 
the Commission in acting as the relevant authority in relation to the particular 
proposed development may, as it thinks fit, do either or both of the following: 
 
(i) 
adopt any assessment, finding or determination that was made by a 
relevant authority that has been acting in relation to the proposed 
development; 
 
(ii) 
continue to assess the proposed development from the stage reached

(7) 
To avoid doubt, if a development involves 2 or more elements that will together 
require planning consent, each element may be assessed separately (including by 
different relevant authorities) and granted a planning consent with respect to that 
particular element. 
 
(8) 
A development will be taken to be an approved development when all relevant 
consents have been granted and a relevant authority has, in accordance with this Act, 
indicated that the development is approved. 
 
(9) 
The provisions of the Building Rules that are relevant to the operation of 
subparagraph (viii) of paragraph (d) of subsection (1) are the provisions of the 
Building Rules as in force at the time the application was made for consent in respect 
of the matters referred to in that paragraph.

Subdivision 3—Code assessed development 
105—Categorisation 
Development falls within the category of code assessed development if— 
 
(a) 
it is classified by the Planning and Design Code as deemed-to-satisfy 
development; or 
 
(b) 
it— 
 
(i) 
does not fall within the category of accepted development; and 
 
(ii) 
does not fall within the category of impact assessed development. 
106—Deemed-to-satisfy assessment 
 
(1) 
If a proposed development is classified as deemed-to-satisfy development, the 
development must be granted planning consent. 
 
(2) 
If a relevant authority is satisfied that development is deemed-to-satisfy development 
except for 1 or more minor variations, the relevant authority must assess it as being 
deemed-to-satisfy (and that determination will then have effect for the purposes of this 
Act). 
 
(3) 
A planning consent under this section must be granted without undertaking a process 
for public notification or submissions in relation to the proposed development. 
 
(4) 
A planning consent under this section will apply subject to conditions imposed under 
this Act and subject to such conditions or exceptions as may be prescribed by the 
regulations or the Planning and Design Code, and subject to any other provision made 
by this Act or applying under the regulations. 
 
(5) 
A condition under subsection (4) may provide that a proposed development assessed 
under subsection (2) will be undertaken so as to address any minor variation in order 
to make it consistent with the deemed-to-satisfy requirement. 
 
(6) 
Nothing in this section requires the assessment of an element of a development that 
may be classified as accepted development. 
107—Performance assessed development 
 
(1) 
In a case where proposed development is to be assessed as code assessed development 
and the development cannot be assessed, or fully assessed, as deemed-to-satisfy 
development, the development will be assessed on its merits against the Planning and 
Design Code. 
 
(2) 
In connection with subsection (1)— 
 
(a) 
to the extent that 1 or more elements of the proposed development may be 
classified as deemed-to-satisfy under the Planning and Design Code (if 
any)—that part of the development will be taken to have been granted 
planning consent; and 
 
(b) 
to the extent that paragraph (a) does not apply (including on the basis that that 
paragraph does not apply at all)—the development will be assessed on its 
merits against the Planning and Design Code; and

(c) 
to the extent that paragraph (b) applies—the development must not be granted 
planning consent if it is, in the opinion of the relevant authority, seriously at 
variance with the Planning and Design Code (disregarding minor variations). 
 
(3) 
If a proposed development is to be assessed under this section— 
 
(a) 
subject to a decision of a relevant authority made in accordance with a 
practice direction, notice of the application for planning consent must be 
given, in accordance with the regulations, to— 
 
(i) 
an owner or occupier of each piece of adjacent land; and 
 
(ii) 
members of the public by notice placed on the relevant land; and 
 
(b) 
a person may, in accordance with the regulations and within a period 
prescribed by the regulations, make representations to the relevant authority 
in relation to the granting or refusal of planning consent; and 
 
(c) 
if a representation is made under paragraph (b) (being a representation 
received in accordance with the regulations and within a period prescribed by 
the regulations), the relevant authority must forward to the applicant a copy of 
the representation and allow the applicant to respond, in accordance with the 
regulations and within a period prescribed by the regulations, to those 
representations. 
 
(4) 
The subject matter of— 
 
(a) 
any notice required under subsection (3)(a); and 
 
(b) 
any representation under subsection (3)(b), 
must be limited to what should be the decision of the relevant authority as to planning 
consent in relation to the performance based elements of the development as assessed 
on its merits (and a relevant authority should limit the matters that it will take into 
account in the same way). 
 
(5) 
In addition, a representation that is not made in accordance with any requirement 
prescribed by the regulations for the purposes of this section is not required to be 
taken into account under this section. 
 
(6) 
The Planning and Design Code may exclude specified classes of development from 
the operation of subsections (3) and (4). 
 
(7) 
A planning consent under this section will apply subject to conditions imposed under 
this Act and subject to such conditions or exceptions as may be prescribed by the 
regulations or the Planning and Design Code, and subject to any other provision made 
by this Act or applying under the regulations. 
 
(8) 
To avoid doubt, the fact that 1 or more elements of a proposed development may be 
classified as deemed-to-satisfy does not prevent a relevant authority deciding not to 
grant planning consent on account of the assessment of the balance of the 
development under this section. 
 
(9) 
A practice direction may specify the form of any notice to be given under this section. 
 (10) Nothing in this section requires the assessment of an element of a development that 
may be classified as accepted development

(i) 
its decision on the application for development; and 
 
(ii) 
the date of the decision; and 
 (iii) the names and addresses of the person or persons who made 
representations to the Commission under that subsection. 
 
(7) 
An appeal against a decision on a development classified as restricted development by 
a person who is entitled to be given notice of the decision under subsection (6) must 
be commenced within 15 business days after the date of the decision. 
 
(8) 
If an appeal is lodged against a decision on a development classified as restricted 
development by a person who is entitled to be given notice of the decision under 
subsection (6), the applicant for the relevant development authorisation must be 
notified by the Court of the appeal and will be a party to the appeal. 
 
(9) 
A decision of the Commission in respect of a development classified as restricted 
development in respect of which representations have been made under this section 
does not operate— 
 
(a) 
until the time within which any person who made any such representation 
may appeal against a decision to grant the development authorisation has 
expired; or 
 
(b) 
if an appeal is commenced— 
 
(i) 
until the appeal is dismissed, struck out or withdrawn; or 
 
(ii) 
until the questions raised by the appeal have been finally determined

 (10) The Commission must, if it makes an assessment under this section in relation to any 
restricted development, take into account the relevant provisions of the Planning and 
Design Code (but is not bound by those provisions). 
 (11) A planning consent under this section will apply subject to conditions imposed under 
this Act and subject to such conditions or exceptions as may be prescribed by the 
regulations or the Planning and Design Code, and subject to any other provision made 
by this Act or applying under the regulations. 
 (12) To avoid doubt, the fact that 1 or more elements of a proposed development may be 
classified as deemed-to-satisfy does not prevent the Commission deciding not to grant 
planning consent on account of the assessment of the development under this section. 
 (13) The Commission may determine the form of any notice to be given under this section. 
 (14) The Commission, acting through its delegate under section 30(3), may refuse an 
application that relates to proposed development classified as restricted development 
without proceeding to make an assessment of the application. 
 (15) A decision to refuse an application under subsection (14) without proceeding to make 
an assessment is, on application under this subsection by the applicant, subject to 
review by the Commission itself.

conditions or exceptions as may be prescribed by the regulations). 
 
(2) 
Subject to subsection (6), a development that is at variance with the Building Rules 
must not be granted a building consent unless— 
 
(a) 
the variance is with the performance requirements of the Building Code or a 
Ministerial building standard and the Commission concurs in the granting of 
the consent; or 
 
(b) 
the variance is with a part of the Building Rules other than the Building Code 
or a Ministerial building standard and the relevant authority determines that it 
is appropriate to grant the consent despite the variance on the basis that it is 
satisfied— 
 
(i) 
that— 
 (A) the provisions of the Building Rules are inappropriate to the 
particular building or building work, or the proposed 
building work fails to conform with the Building Rules only 
in minor respects; and

(B) 
the variance is justifiable having regard to the objects of the 
Planning and Design Code or the performance requirements 
of the Building Code or a Ministerial building standard (as 
the case may be) and would achieve the objects of this Act 
as effectively, or more effectively, than if the variance were 
not to be allowed; or 
 
(ii) 
in a case where the consent is being sought after the development has 
occurred—that the variance is justifiable in the circumstances of the 
particular case. 
 
(3) 
No appeal lies against— 
 
(a) 
a refusal of concurrence by the Commission under subsection (2)(a); or 
 
(b) 
a refusal of building consent by a relevant authority if the Commission has 
refused its concurrence under subsection (2)(a); or 
 
(c) 
a condition attached to a consent or approval that is expressed to apply by 
virtue of a variance with the performance requirements of the Building Code 
or a Ministerial building standard. 
 
(4) 
A relevant authority may, at the request or with the agreement of the applicant, refer 
proposed building work to the Commission for an opinion on whether or not it 
complies with the performance requirements of the Building Code or a Ministerial 
building standard. 
 
(5) 
In addition, regulations made for purposes of this subsection may provide that 
building work of a prescribed class must not be granted a building consent unless the 
Commission concurs in the granting of the consent. 
 
(6) 
If an inconsistency exists between the Building Rules and the Planning Rules in 
relation to a State heritage place or a local heritage place— 
 
(a) 
the Planning Rules prevail and the Building Rules do not apply to the extent 
of the inconsistency; but 
 
(b) 
the relevant authority must, in determining an application for building rules 
consent, ensure, so far as is reasonably practicable, that standards of building 
soundness, occupant safety and amenity are achieved in respect of the 
development that are as good as can reasonably be achieved in the 
circumstances. 
 
(7) 
A relevant authority must seek and consider the advice of the Commission before 
imposing or agreeing to a requirement under subsection (6) that would be at variance 
with the performance requirements of the Building Code or a Ministerial building 
standard. 
 
(8) 
Subject to this Act, a relevant authority must accept that proposed building work 
complies with the Building Rules to the extent that— 
 
(a) 
such compliance is certified by the provision of technical details, particulars, 
plans, drawings or specifications prepared and certified in accordance with 
the regulations; or 
 
(b) 
such compliance is certified by a building certifier.

(9) 
No act or omission by a relevant authority in good faith in connection with the 
operation of subsections (6) or (8)(a) (other than where a certificate under 
subsection (8)(a) is given by a building certifier) subjects the relevant authority to any 
liability. 
 (10) The relevant authority may refuse to grant a consent in relation to any development if, 
as a result of that development, the type or standard of construction of a building of a 
particular classification would cease to conform with the requirements of the Building 
Rules for a building of that classification. 
 (11) If a relevant authority decides to grant building consent in relation to a development 
that is at variance with the Building Rules, the relevant authority must, subject to the 
regulations, in giving notice of its decision on the application for that consent, specify 
(in the notice or in an accompanying document)— 
 
(a) 
the variance; and 
 
(b) 
the grounds on which the decision is being made.

regulated tree that is located on adjoining land but is encroaching on to the relevant 
land. 
 
(3) 
A relevant authority may request an applicant— 
 
(a) 
to provide such additional documents, assessments or information (including 
calculations and technical details) as the relevant authority may reasonably 
require to assess the application; 
 
(b) 
to remedy any defect or deficiency in any application or accompanying

(b) 
the relevant authority must not make its decision until it has received a 
response from that prescribed body in relation to the matter or matters for 
which the referral was made (but if a response is not received from the body 
within a period prescribed by the regulations, it will be presumed, unless the 
body notifies the relevant authority within that period that the body requires 
an extension of time because of subsection (4) (being an extension equal to 
that period of time that the applicant takes to comply with a request under 
subsection (3)), that the body does not desire to make a response, or concurs 
(as the case requires)). 
 
(2) 
The Governor must not prescribe a body (other than the Commission) under 
subsection (1)(a) unless— 
 
(a) 
the Governor is satisfied that provisions about the policy or policies that the 
body will seek to apply in connection with the operation of this section have 
been included in the Planning and Design Code (recognising that a policy 
may not apply in all cases, or that a policy may need to be varied, adjusted or 
reconsidered in particular cases); or 
 
(b) 
the Minister has indicated that the Minister is satisfied that a policy envisaged

(ii) 
if the relevant authority decides to consent to or approve the

to the conditions that may be imposed by the prescribed body, to 
impose such conditions as the prescribed body thinks fit, 
(and the relevant authority must comply with any such direction).

(6) 
If a relevant authority acting by direction of a prescribed body refuses an application 
or imposes conditions in respect of a development authorisation— 
 
(a) 
the relevant authority must notify the applicant that the application was 
refused, or the conditions imposed, by direction under this section; and 
 
(b) 
if the regulations so provide, no appeal lies against that refusal or those 
conditions. 
 
(7) 
If a relevant authority is directed by a prescribed body to refuse an application and the 
refusal is the subject of an appeal under this Act, the prescribed body is a respondent 
to the appeal and the relevant authority may, on application, be joined as a party to the 
proceedings. 
 
(8) 
If a relevant authority is directed by a prescribed body to impose a condition in respect 
of a development authorisation and the condition is the subject of an appeal under this 
Act, both the prescribed body and the relevant authority are respondents to the appeal. 
 
(9) 
A prescribed body acting under this section is only to deal with the matter or matters 
for which a referral was made to the extent that is relevant to the purpose of the 
referral and so as only to consider matters that are within its relevant field of expertise 
or operation. 
 (10) An applicant may request a relevant authority to defer a referral under this section to a 
particular stage in the process of assessment and, in such a case, the relevant authority 
must comply with the request. 
 (11) However, a request under subsection (10) may not be made if it is inconsistent with 
any provision made by the regulations for the purposes of this subsection. 
 (12) A relevant authority must ensure that a response from a prescribed body under this 
section is published on the SA planning portal and available for inspection and 
downloading without charge as soon as is reasonably practicable after the response is 
received by the relevant authority. 
123—Preliminary advice and agreement 
 
(1) 
A person may seek the opinion of a prescribed body under section 122 in relation to 
proposed development before lodging an application for planning consent with respect 
to the development. 
 
(2) 
If— 
 
(a) 
a proposed development is referred to a prescribed body under subsection (1); 
and 
 
(b) 
the prescribed body agrees to consider the matter under this section after 
taking into account any matter prescribed by the regulations; and 
 
(c) 
the prescribed body agrees, in the manner prescribed by the regulations, that 
the development meets the requirements (if any) of the prescribed body 
(including on the basis of the imposition of conditions), 
then, subject to subsection (4)— 
 
(d) 
if an application for planning consent with respect to the development is 
lodged with the relevant authority within the prescribed period after the 
prescribed body has indicated its agreement under paragraph (c); and

(e) 
if the relevant authority is satisfied that the application accords with the 
agreement indicated by the prescribed body (taking into account the terms or 
elements of that agreement and any relevant plans and other documentation), 
the application will not be referred to the prescribed body under section 122. 
 
(3) 
A prescribed body under section 122 may, in connection with the operation of 
subsections (1) and (2)— 
 
(a) 
require the payment of a fee prescribed by the regulations (if the prescribed 
body agrees to consider the matter under subsection (2)(b)); and 
 
(b) 
in relation to the proposed development—exercise any power (including the 
power to impose conditions) that it would be able to exercise if the 
development were to be referred to it under section 122. 
 
(4) 
Any agreement under this section will cease to have effect (and an application will 
need to be referred to a prescribed body under section 122 despite the operation of 
subsection (2)) if the relevant authority determines that the agreement is no longer 
appropriate due to the operation of section 132. 
 
(5) 
If— 
 
(a) 
a prescribed body had indicated its agreement under this section; and 
 
(b) 
an application is not referred to the prescribed body under section 122 by 
virtue of the operation of subsection (2) of this section, 
the process established by this section will be taken to be a referral under section 122 
for the purposes of any other Act. 
124—Proposed development involving creation of fortifications 
 
(1) 
If a relevant authority has reason to believe that a proposed development may involve 
the creation of fortifications, the relevant authority must refer the application for 
consent to, or approval of, the proposed development to the Commissioner of Police 
(the Commissioner). 
 
(2) 
Subject to subsection (3), the Commissioner must, as soon as possible after receipt of 
a referral under subsection (1)— 
 
(a) 
assess the application to determine whether or not the proposed development 
involves the creation of fortifications; and 
 
(b) 
advise the relevant authority in writing of the Commissioner's determination. 
 
(3) 
The Commissioner may, before making a determination under this section, request the 
applicant to provide such additional documents or information (including calculations 
and technical details) as the Commissioner may reasonably require to assess the 
application. 
 
(4) 
If a request is made under subsection (3)— 
 
(a) 
the Commissioner may specify a time within which the request must be 
complied with; and 
 
(b) 
the Commissioner may, if he or she thinks fit, grant an extension of the time 
specified under paragraph (a).

(5) 
If the Commissioner determines that the proposed development involves the creation 
of fortification, the relevant authority must— 
 
(a) 
if the proposed development consists only of the creation 
fortifications—refuse the application; or 
 
(b) 
in any other case—impose conditions in respect of any consent to or approval 
of the proposed development prohibiting the creation of the fortifications. 
 
(6) 
If a relevant authority acting on the basis of a determination of the Commissioner 
under subsection (2) refuses an application or imposes conditions in respect of a 
development authorisation, the relevant authority must notify the applicant that the 
application was refused, or the conditions imposed, on the basis of a determination of 
the Commissioner under this section. 
 
(7) 
If a refusal or condition referred to in subsection (5) is the subject of an appeal under 
this Act— 
 
(a) 
the Commissioner will be the respondent to the appeal; and 
 
(b) 
the relevant authority may, if the Court permits, be joined as a party to the 
appeal. 
125—Time within which decision must be made 
 
(1) 
A relevant authority should deal with an application as expeditiously as possible and 
within the time prescribed by the regulations. 
 
(2) 
If a relevant authority does not decide an application within the time prescribed under 
subsection (1) in respect of the provision of planning consent, the applicant may, 
before the application is decided, give the relevant authority a notice in the prescribed 
manner and form (a deemed consent notice) that states that planning consent should 
be granted. 
 
(3) 
On the day that the relevant authority receives the deemed consent notice, the relevant 
authority is, subject to this section, taken to have granted the planning consent (a 
deemed planning consent). 
 
(4) 
The relevant authority may, within 10 business days after receiving the deemed 
consent notice— 
 
(a) 
grant the planning consent itself; or 
 
(b) 
grant the planning consent subject to conditions. 
 
(5) 
The deemed planning consent is taken to include— 
 
(a) 
any conditions that a relevant authority imposes under subsection (4)(b); or 
 
(b) 
if the relevant authority does not grant a planning consent under 
subsection (4)—any standard condition specified by a practice direction 
issued by the Commission for the purposes of this subsection. 
 
(6) 
If— 
 
(a) 
a deemed planning consent is taken to have been granted under 
subsection (3); and 
 
(b) 
a relevant authority considers that the relevant application for planning 
consent should have been refused,

the relevant authority may apply to the Court for an order quashing the consent. 
 
(7) 
An application under subsection (6) must be made within 1 month after the deemed 
planning consent is taken to have been granted unless the Court, in its discretion, 
allows an extension of time (and then the Court will determine the matter under 
section 205). 
 
(8) 
If a relevant authority does not decide an application within the time prescribed under 
subsection (1) in respect of the provision of a development authorisation other than 
planning consent, the applicant may, after giving the relevant authority 14 days notice 
in accordance with the regulations, apply to the Court for an order requiring the 
relevant authority to make its determination within a time fixed by the Court. 
 
(9) 
If the Court makes an order under subsection (8), the Court should also order the 
relevant authority to pay the applicant's costs of the proceedings unless the Court is 
satisfied— 
 
(a) 
that the delay is not attributable to an act or omission of the relevant 
authority; or 
 
(b) 
that the delay is attributable to a decision of the relevant authority not to deal 
with the application within the relevant time because— 
 
(i) 
it appeared to the relevant authority that there had been a failure to 
comply with a requirement prescribed by or under this Act; or 
 
(ii) 
the relevant authority was not provided with appropriate 
documentation or information relevant to making a decision under 
this Act; or 
 (iii) the relevant authority believed, on other reasonable grounds, that it 
was not appropriate to decide the matter in the particular 
circumstances; or 
 
(c) 
that an order for costs should not be made for some other reason. 
 (10) This section does not apply to or in relation to impact assessed development where the 
Minister is the relevant authority. 
126—Determination of application 
 
(1) 
A relevant authority must, on making a decision on an application under this Part, give 
notice of the decision in accordance with the regulations (and, in the case of a refusal, 
the notice must include the reasons for the refusal and any appeal rights that exist 
under this Act). 
 
(2) 
A development authorisation under this Part remains operative for a period prescribed 
by the regulations. 
 
(3) 
A relevant authority may, on its own initiative or on the application of a person who 
has the benefit of any relevant development authorisation, extend a period prescribed 
under subsection (2).

A court may, on the application of a person who is a party to proceedings before the 
court which relate to any matter arising under this Act, extend a period prescribed 
under subsection (2).

Division 1—General principles 
132—Law governing proceedings under this Act 
 
(1) 
If an application is made for a development authorisation under this Act, the law to be 
applied in deciding the application and the law to be applied in resolving any issues 
arising from the decision in any proceedings (whether brought under this Act or not) is 
the law in force as at the time the application was made. 
 
(2) 
The provisions of the Planning and Design Code that are relevant to the consideration 
of an application for a planning consent and to the resolution of issues arising in 
subsequent proceedings based on that application (whether brought under this Act or 
not) are the provisions of the Planning and Design Code as in force at the time the 
application was made. 
 
(3) 
The provisions of the Building Rules that are relevant to the consideration of an 
application for a building consent and to the resolution of issues arising in subsequent 
proceedings based on that application (whether brought under this Act or not) are the 
provisions of the Building Rules as in force at the time the application was made. 
 
(4) 
If a place that is the subject of an application for development authorisation under this 
Act becomes a State heritage place within the meaning of this Act, the place will be 
taken to have been a State heritage place for the purposes of this section at the time the 
application was made. 
 
(5) 
If a place that is the subject of an application for development authorisation under this 
Act becomes subject to an order under the Heritage Places Act 1993 that requires a 
person to stop any work or activity, or prohibits any work or activity, the order will be 
taken to have been in force for the purposes of this section at the time the application 
was made. 
133—Saving provisions 
 
(1) 
A development for which development authorisation has been granted may be 
undertaken and completed in accordance with that authorisation notwithstanding an 
amendment to the Planning and Design Code or the Building Rules that takes effect 
after the date on which the application for the development authorisation was made 
(insofar as the application relates to an assessment in respect of the Planning and 
Design Code or Building Rules). 
 
(2) 
An activity that becomes a development by virtue of an amendment to this Act, but 
was lawfully commenced within 3 years before the amendment took effect, may be 
continued and completed, without any development authorisation, within 3 years after 
the date on which the amendment took effect. 
 
(3) 
A relevant authority may, in order to avoid or reduce hardship, extend the limitation 
period referred to in subsection (2). 
 
(4) 
A reference in this section to an amendment to this Act extends to the making of a 
regulation declaring an activity to constitute development and the variation of such a 
regulation.

Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002 
 
(i) 
subject to the qualification that any reference under that Subdivision 
to the Commission is to have effect as if it were a reference to the 
Minister or the Authority, depending on who has made the 
determination, but the EIS will cover matters determined by the 
Minister after consultation with the Authority; and 
 
(ii) 
subject to any other modifications as may be prescribed by the 
regulations. 
 
(5) 
The Minister, after obtaining and considering a report of a prescribed kind on a 
designated matter referred for advice under this section and after considering the terms 
of any relevant EIS, must advise the appropriate Authority on the steps that should be 
taken (including, in relation to an application for a relevant licence, whether the 
application should or should not be granted or, as relevant, what conditions or 
requirements should be included in a relevant licence or a statement of environmental 
objectives) in order to recognise and address actual or potential adverse effects on the 
environment. 
 
(6) 
If the appropriate Authority does not agree with advice tendered under subsection (5), 
it must refer the matter to the Governor and the Governor will determine whether the 
Authority should adhere to the advice (after considering the terms of any relevant 
EIS). 
 
(7) 
The appropriate Authority may, with the concurrence of the Minister, determine that it 
is appropriate that proposed development associated with operations within the ambit 
of subsection (4)(a) also be assessed under this section and, if the Authority makes 
such a determination, the Authority may, by notice published in the Gazette, combine 
the assessment of the proposed development with the assessment of the relevant 
operations and, in such a case— 
 
(a) 
the proposed development associated with the operations must also be 
considered under the relevant EIS; and 
 
(b) 
the Minister may deal with the development under section 115 as if the 
development had been declared to be impact assessed development. 
161—Related matters 
 
(1) 
This Part does not limit the ability of the Minister to make a declaration under 
section 108(1)(c) with respect to 1 or more of the following: 
 
(a) 
proposed mining operations on a mining tenement; 
 
(b) 
proposed development associated with operations to be conducted under a 
relevant licence; 
 
(c) 
regulated activities within the meaning of the Hydrogen and Renewable 
Energy Act 2023. 
 
(2) 
For the avoidance of doubt, a determination under this Part with respect to the 
preparation of an EIS does not bring the relevant mining operations or relevant 
regulated activities (as the case may be) within the ambit of Part 7 Division 2 
Subdivision 4 (but may bring an associated development within the ambit of that 
Subdivision by virtue of the operation of section 160(7)).

(3) 
Except as provided in this Part, this Act does not prevent, or otherwise affect, 
operations carried on in pursuance of any of the Mining Acts or operations undertaken 
pursuant to the Hydrogen and Renewable Energy Act 2023 (other than operations 
undertaken pursuant to Schedule 1 Part 5 of that Act). 
 (3a) To avoid doubt, operations undertaken pursuant to the Hydrogen and Renewable 
Energy Act 2023 do not include operations undertaken pursuant to an exemption from 
authorisation under that Act. 
 
(4) 
This Act does not prevent, or otherwise affect, the operation of a private mine. 
 
(5) 
The operation of subsections (3) and (4) is subject to any provision made by the 
regulations as to the application of the Building Rules to any building work carried out 
in connection with operations carried on in pursuance of any of the Mining Acts or the 
Hydrogen and Renewable Energy Act 2023.

Subdivision 3—Establishment of general schemes 
164—Initiation of scheme 
 
(1) 
The Minister may initiate a scheme under this Division in relation to the provision of 
essential infrastructure (and the undertaking of any related development). 
 
(2) 
A scheme under this Division should relate to 1 or more of the following purposes: 
 
(a) 
to facilitate development or urban renewal of a significant nature by 
providing a scheme that supports and advances the provision of 
infrastructure;

(b) 
identifies the location in relation to which it is proposed that the scheme will 
be established; and 
 
(c) 
provides information about the proposed timing or staging of the various 
elements of the scheme; and 
 
(d) 
assesses the costs and benefits of the scheme; and 
 
(e) 
outlines a funding arrangement for the scheme; and 
 
(f) 
if a funding arrangement includes a proposal for the collection of 
contributions under Subdivision 8—specifies the area or areas (to be called a 
contribution area) in relation to which it is proposed that the contributions 
are to be imposed; and 
 
(g) 
provides information about the person or body that will be carrying out the 
work envisaged by the scheme (to the extent that this is known); and 
 
(h) 
identifies any infrastructure or other assets that might be expected to be 
transferred to another entity when the scheme has been completed; and 
 
(i) 
provides such other information as the Minister thinks fit. 
 
(7) 
In giving consideration to the nature and intended scope of infrastructure under a 
scheme, the Minister must seek to facilitate the provision of infrastructure that is— 
 
(a) 
fit for purpose; and 
 
(b) 
capable of adaptation as standards or technology change over time (insofar 
as is reasonably practicable or appropriate in the circumstances); and 
 
(c) 
capable of augmentation or extension to accommodate growth or changing 
circumstances over time (insofar as is reasonably practicable or appropriate

of, or in connection with, the scheme; and 
 
(f) 
capable of being procured and delivered in a timely manner to facilitate and 
promote orderly and economic development. 
 
(8) 
In giving consideration to whether to include a proposal for the collection of 
contributions under Subdivision 8, the Minister must take into account— 
 
(a) 
the extent to which it is reasonable that other sources of funding be used 
instead; and 
 
(b) 
the extent to which the implementation of the scheme will have an impact on 
any council (including on account of any infrastructure or other assets that 
might be transferred to the council when the scheme has been completed) 
after taking into account any submissions made by the council under 
subsection (12); and 
 
(c) 
the extent to which the relevant infrastructure will provide a direct benefit 
to—

Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002 
 
(i) 
the development potential, capacity, use, value or amenity of the land 
that would be expected to be included within a relevant contribution 
area; and 
 
(ii) 
without limiting subparagraph (i), people who might be required to 
make contributions through the imposition of a charge under 
Subdivision 8 by the relevant council; and 
 
(d) 
any schemes or arrangements (including with respect to the imposition of 
separate or other rates or charges) that are already in place, or are already 
planned (and known to the Minister), with respect to the provision of 
infrastructure or the undertaking of works in the area (or in an adjacent or 
related area). 
 
(9) 
In giving consideration to the establishment of a contribution area under 
subsection (6)(f), consideration must be given to— 
 
(a) 
the area or areas which will benefit from any infrastructure or works to be 
provided or undertaken under the proposed scheme; and 
 
(b) 
the extent to which it may be possible for contributions towards the costs of 
the scheme to be equitably proportioned between potential beneficiaries; and 
 
(c) 
the extent to which the contribution area may overlap with another 
contribution area under another scheme (or proposed scheme). 
 (10) The Minister must, in considering a scheme under this Subdivision, apply the principle 
that a scheme that relates to, or includes, basic infrastructure and is more suited to a 
scheme under Subdivision 2 should not be initiated under this Subdivision. 
 (11) However, nothing in subsection (10) (or Subdivision 2) prevents a contribution being 
sought with respect to basic infrastructure under Subdivision 8 insofar as it is 
considered by the Minister to be reasonable that owners of land within a contribution 
area (and outside a designated growth area) should make a contribution towards the 
cost of that basic infrastructure. 
 (12) The Minister, in preparing the draft outline, must— 
 
(a) 
take reasonable steps to consult with the council within whose area the 
scheme is proposed to be undertaken and, if relevant, any council whose area 
may include the whole or any part of a proposed contribution area; and 
 
(b) 
take reasonable steps to consult with the owners of any land that would be 
directly affected by any infrastructure or works to be provided or undertaken 
under the proposed scheme, 
and may consult with any other person or body as the Minister thinks fit. 
 (13) The Minister will then publish the draft outline— 
 
(a) 
in the Gazette; and 
 
(b) 
on the SA planning portal.

determined by the Chief Executive. 
 
(5) 
The Chief Executive must, in exercising a power under this section, act with the 
concurrence of the Commission. 
166—Consideration of proposed scheme 
 
(1) 
A scheme coordinator has the following functions in relation to a proposed scheme: 
 
(a) 
to prepare scoped and costed proposals for the scheme that accord with any 
relevant design standards; 
 
(b) 
to develop a work program for the scheme; 
 
(c) 
to undertake consultation in relation to the scheme in accordance with any

Chief Executive. 
 
(2) 
In addition to the other provisions of this Division, in developing a funding 
arrangement that includes a proposal for the imposition of a charge made under 
Subdivision 7, the scheme coordinator should seek to act consistently with the 
following principles: 
 
(a) 
the charge should be limited to recovering the reasonable capital costs of the 
basic infrastructure based only on infrastructure that is not excessive and that 
is not produced or delivered at a cost or price that is unreasonable in the 
circumstances; and 
 
(b) 
the charge should not have an excessively adverse impact on— 
 
(i) 
the development of a designated growth area; or 
 
(ii) 
housing or living affordability within a designated growth area; or 
 (iii) employment, investment or economic viability associated with a 
designated growth area; and 
 
(c) 
the charge must be based on a scheme under which a payment or payments 
under the charge become payable (or commence to become payable) on a 
specified event or events; and 
 
(d) 
funding under the scheme should recognise the need to provide value for 
money in connection with funding arrangements including, as appropriate, 
through contestable provision of basic infrastructure; and 
 
(e) 
rebates for charges should be available in appropriate circumstances; and 
 
(f) 
exemptions from the imposition of a charge should be considered depending 
on the circumstances of the case. 
 
(3) 
In connection with subsection (2)(c), an event or events that trigger the requirement to 
make, or to begin to make, a payment under a charge must be related to when 
development is undertaken being— 
 
(a) 
the depositing of a plan for the division of land under Part 19AB of the Real 
Property Act 1886; or 
 
(b) 
undertaking of approved development. 
 
(4) 
In addition to subsection (2)(f), exemptions from the imposition of a charge under 
Subdivision 7 will apply in any circumstances prescribed by the regulations. 
 
(5) 
In addition to the other provisions of this Division, in developing a funding 
arrangement that includes a proposal for the collection of contributions under 
Subdivision 8, the scheme coordinator should seek to act consistently with the 
following principles: 
 
(a) 
the contributions should be limited to recovering the reasonable capital costs 
of the scheme based only on infrastructure that is not excessive and that is not 
produced or delivered at a cost or price that is unreasonable in the 
circumstances; 
 
(b) 
the contributions should not have an excessively adverse impact on—

(ii) 
employment, investment or economic viability associated with a 
contribution area; 
 
(c) 
the timing of the collection of contributions under the scheme should be 
connected to the production or delivery of infrastructure to which the 
contributions relate, such that the scheme should not involve the collection of 
an excessive amount of contributions before the relevant infrastructure is 
produced or delivered; and 
 
(d) 
funding under the scheme— 
 
(i) 
may, as appropriate— 
 (A) seek to attribute costs over the lifetime of the relevant 
infrastructure (or over some other appropriate period); or 
 
(B) 
be based on contributions that become payable on a 
specified event or events; and 
 
(ii) 
should recognise the need to provide value for money in connection 
with funding arrangements including, as appropriate, through the 
contestable provision of infrastructure; 
 
(e) 
augmentation charges should be shared between beneficiaries in proportion to 
the benefits that they receive; 
 
(f) 
rebates for charges imposed under Subdivision 8 should be available in 
appropriate circumstances; 
 
(g) 
exemptions from the imposition of charges imposed under Subdivision 8 
should be considered depending on the circumstances of the case. 
 
(6) 
In connection with subsection (5)(d)(i)(B), an event or events that trigger the 
requirement to make, or to begin to make, contributions should be related to when a 
benefit will begin to accrue, or is intended to accrue— 
 
(a) 
in relation to land; or 
 
(b) 
to the persons who will be subject to charges within a contribution area under 
Subdivision 8, 
being (for example)— 
 
(c) 
the division of land; or 
 
(d) 
a change to Planning and Design Code; or 
 
(e) 
an approval or the undertaking of development (including development 
involving the provision of infrastructure). 
 
(7) 
In addition to subsection (5)(g), exemptions from the imposition of a charge imposed 
under Subdivision 8 will apply in any circumstances prescribed by the regulations.

inclusions as the Minister thinks fit; or 
 
(b) 
determine not to proceed with the scheme. 
 
(2) 
However, the Minister must, before making a variation, exclusion or inclusion under 
subsection (1)(a) that will involve a significant change to the scheme, refer the scheme 
(including the proposed variation, exclusion or inclusion) to the scheme coordinator 
for the scheme coordinator to consider and report to the Minister on the scheme in 
accordance with section 166 as if it were a proposed scheme under that section. 
 
(3) 
If the Minister decides to proceed under subsection (1)(a), the Minister must cause a 
final outline of the scheme to be— 
 
(a) 
notified in the Gazette; and 
 
(b) 
published on the SA planning portal. 
 
(4) 
A funding arrangement that forms part of a scheme takes effect subject to obtaining an 
approval under Subdivision 6. 
 
(5) 
The Minister may, if the Minister considers it necessary or appropriate to do so, vary 
an outline of the scheme at any time. 
 
(6) 
A variation under subsection (5) may include a proposal to vary a funding 
arrangement that has been approved under Subdivision 6. 
 
(7) 
The Minister must, before making a variation that will involve a significant change to 
the scheme— 
 
(a) 
if the scheme provides for the imposition of a charge under Subdivision 7, 
give consideration to whether or not such a charge should be included in the 
scheme, taking into account the variation and the matters referred to in 
section 163(9); and 
 
(b) 
seek the advice of the Commission; and 
 
(c) 
take reasonable steps to consult with the council within whose area the 
scheme is proposed to be undertaken and, if relevant, any council whose area 
may include the whole or any part of a proposed contribution area; and

(d) 
take reasonable steps to consult with the owners of any land that would be 
directly affected by any infrastructure or works to be provided or undertaken 
under the proposed scheme; and 
 
(e) 
consult with any other person or body as the Minister thinks fit, 
and the Minister must then refer the scheme (as proposed to be varied) to the scheme 
coordinator. 
 
(8) 
The scheme coordinator must, on a referral under subsection (7), consider and report 
to the Minister on the scheme in accordance with section 166 as if it were a proposed 
scheme under that section. 
 
(9) 
A variation under subsection (5) will be made by the Minister by instrument— 
 
(a) 
notified in the Gazette; and 
 
(b) 
published on the SA planning portal. 
 (10) The Minister may, in constituting a scheme, include or address any other matter as the 
Minister thinks fit. 
 (11) To avoid doubt, the liabilities of a scheme will accrue under the terms of the scheme 
(and, if relevant, against a fund established under Subdivision 9 and not against a 
council that is required to make contributions under Subdivision 8). 
 (12) Once a scheme has been adopted by the Minister, the Chief Executive must ensure 
that the Commission is kept informed about the operation of the scheme (and any 
significant changes to the scheme) under an arrangement established by the Chief 
Executive in consultation with the Commission. 
168—Role of scheme coordinator in relation to delivery of scheme 
 
(1) 
The scheme coordinator has the following functions in relation to a scheme 
established under this Division: 
 
(a) 
to oversee the delivery of any infrastructure or works that form part of the 
scheme; 
 
(b) 
if a funding arrangement is approved under this Division—to administer the 
funding arrangement and to provide advice to the Minister about the 
enforcement of any charge under Subdivision 7 or the levels and amounts of 
any contributions that are to be recovered under Subdivision 8; 
 
(c) 
to provide advice to the Minister about what should happen on the completion 
of the works associated with the scheme; 
 
(d) 
to provide advice on any other matter at the request of the Minister or as the 
scheme coordinator thinks fit; 
 
(e) 
such other functions assigned by the Minister after consultation with the 
Chief Executive. 
 
(2) 
Without limiting subsection (1), the scheme coordinator should seek to ensure that 
essential infrastructure is procured and delivered in a timely manner and at reasonable 
cost and, in so doing, apply and act in accordance with the following principles: 
 
(a) 
the cost of essential infrastructure should be open and transparent;

Part 13—Infrastructure frameworks 
Division 1—Infrastructure delivery schemes 
12 
Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002 
 
(b) 
the design of, and procurement processes for, essential infrastructure should 
be dynamic, flexible and adaptable to the changes in circumstances, 
especially changes within a designated growth area or contribution area; 
 
(c) 
essential infrastructure should be delivered in a way that facilitates and 
promotes orderly and economic development, economic growth and 
employment. 
 
(3) 
In addition, the scheme coordinator should, insofar as is reasonable, seek out and 
bring to the attention of the Chief Executive any additional or alternative funding 
sources that could ensure that charges and contributions under any funding 
arrangement for infrastructure under the relevant scheme are kept as low as possible. 
Subdivision 6—Funding arrangements 
169—Funding arrangements 
 
(1) 
A funding arrangement established under this Division may— 
 
(a) 
include 1 or more of the following: 
 
(i) 
the provision of funds from public or private sources (including by 
the Treasurer providing guarantees if the Treasurer thinks fit); 
 
(ii) 
exemptions from 1 or more taxes, levies or local government rates 
imposed under a law of the State; 
 (iii) the imposition of a charge under Subdivision 7, including by 
establishing a designated growth area; 
 (iv) the collection of contributions under Subdivision 8, including by 
designating the relevant contribution area or areas; and 
 
(b) 
include a scheme for rebates and other adjustments in relation to contributions 
that would be otherwise payable under Subdivision 7 or Subdivision 8 (and 
any such scheme will have effect according to its terms); and 
 
(c) 
provide for any charge or other amount to be imposed, collected, rebated or 
adjusted according to a determination of ESCOSA, or of some other specified 
person or body (including a determination that is made after the scheme has 
been approved under this section); and 
 
(d) 
include a scheme for other works to be undertaken on an "in kind" basis; and 
 
(e) 
provide for other matters determined by the Minister. 
 
(2) 
In connection with subsection (1)— 
 
(a) 
a scheme that provides for the imposition of a charge under Subdivision 7— 
 
(i) 
may provide for the indexing of the charge under an index, or at a 
rate, determined or approved by the ESCOSA, or by some other 
prescribed person or body; and 
 
(ii) 
must specify arrangements for the periodic review of the charge 
under the relevant scheme and, as part of such a review, may provide 
for any matter to be considered or determined by ESCOSA, or by 
some other prescribed person or body; and

Infrastructure frameworks—Part 13 
Infrastructure delivery schemes—Division 1 
Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002

(b) 
a scheme that provides for the collection of contributions under Subdivision 8 
must specify arrangements for the periodic review of the levels and amounts 
of those contributions and, as part of such a review, may provide for any 
matter to be considered or determined by ESCOSA, or by some other 
prescribed person or body, on application by the Minister or a council; and 
 
(c) 
ESCOSA has (in addition to ESCOSA's functions and powers under the 
Essential Services Commission Act 2002)— 
 
(i) 
the ability to make a determination for the purposes of 
subsection (1)(c); and 
 
(ii) 
the ability to act on an application under paragraph (a) or (b); and 
 (iii) any other functions and powers conferred by regulations made under 
this Act; and 
 
(d) 
if ESCOSA is to act under this section, the Essential Services Commission 
Act 2002 may apply subject to such modifications as may be prescribed by 
regulations made on the recommendation of the Minister after consultation 
with ESCOSA. 
 
(3) 
Despite paragraph (a) of subsection (2), ESCOSA, or another prescribed person or 
body acting in accordance with that paragraph, may not make a determination in 
relation to a scheme that provides for the imposition of a charge under Subdivision 7 
that results in the charge being payable over a longer period of time than the period 
applying under the funding arrangement established by the scheme. 
 
(4) 
Despite the preceding subsections, a funding arrangement under a scheme that 
provides for the imposition of a charge under Subdivision 7 must provide that the 
liability to make a payment or payments under the charge after the occurrence of an 
event or events that trigger the requirement to make, or to begin to make, such 
payments cannot be transferred to a purchaser of any land or dwelling to which the 
scheme relates who intends to occupy the land or dwelling for residential purposes. 
 
(5) 
A funding arrangement has no force or effect unless or until it has been approved by 
the Governor by notice published in the Gazette. 
 
(6) 
The Governor may vary or revoke a funding arrangement approved under 
subsection (5) by further notice published in the Gazette. 
 
(7) 
If the Governor approves or varies a funding arrangement under this section, the 
Minister must— 
 
(a) 
prepare a report that sets out the funding arrangement and information about 
any contribution that is to be collected under Subdivision 8 or charge that is 
to be imposed under Subdivision 7 or, if relevant, the extent of a variation; 
and 
 
(b) 
furnish a copy of the report to the ERD Committee; and 
 
(c) 
publish a copy of the report on the SA planning portal.

those contributions)— 
 
(a) 
the Minister has made a recommendation for the purposes of this subsection 
to the Governor that the funding arrangement be approved; and 
 
(b) 
the funding arrangement has been approved by all of the persons who, at the

represent the interests of persons who are directly involved 
in providing infrastructure or developing land that may be 
subject to a scheme of the relevant kind under this Division; 
and 
 
(B) 
if the funding arrangement is specifically relevant to a 
particular council or councils—that council or those 
councils; and 
 
(C) 
the LGA; and 
 (D) any other person or body specified by the Minister; and 
 
(ii)

 (10) The Commission may only make a recommendation to the Minister under 
subsection (9)(a)(ii)(B) if the Commission is satisfied, having regard to any 
consultation on the scheme undertaken by the scheme coordinator, that the scheme 
provides for contributions under Subdivision 8, and rebates and other adjustments in 
relation to the contributions, in a manner that— 
 
(a) 
is fair and equitable; and 
 
(b) 
would not unreasonably disadvantage persons who own small areas of land 
within the relevant contribution area or areas; and 
 
(c) 
is reasonable taking into account the matters referred to in section 164(8) and 
the principles referred to in section 166(5). 
 (11) If a report furnished to the ERD Committee under subsection (7) relates to the 
approval of a scheme for the collection of contributions under Subdivision 8 (a 
contributions scheme) or the approval or variation of a funding arrangement under a 
scheme that provides for the imposition of a charge under Subdivision 7 (a charge 
scheme), the ERD Committee must, after receiving the report— 
 
(a) 
resolve that it does not object to the contributions scheme or charge scheme 
(as the case requires); or 
 
(b) 
resolve to suggest amendments to the contributions scheme or charge scheme 
(as the case requires); or 
 
(c) 
resolve to object to the contributions scheme or charge scheme (as the case 
requires). 
 (12) Subject to subsection (14), if, at the expiration of 28 days from the day on which the 
report was referred to the ERD Committee under subsection (7), the ERD Committee 
has not made a resolution under subsection (11), it will be conclusively presumed that 
the ERD Committee does not object to the contributions scheme or charge scheme (as 
the case requires) and does not propose to suggest any amendments. 
 (13) Subject to subsection (14), if the period of 28 days referred to in subsection (12) 
would, but for this subsection, expire in a particular case between 15 December in 
1 year and 15 January in the next year (both days inclusive), the period applying for 
the purposes of subsection (12) will be extended on the basis that any days falling on 
or between those 2 dates will not be taken into account for the purposes of calculating 
the period that applies under subsection (12). 
 (14) If the period applying under subsection (12), including by virtue of subsection (13), 
would, but for this subsection, expire in a particular case sometime between the day 
on which the House of Assembly is dissolved for the purposes of a general election 
and the day on which the ERD Committee is reconstituted at the beginning of the first 
session of the new Parliament after that election (both days inclusive), the period will 
be extended by force of this subsection so as to expire 28 days from the day on which 
the ERD Committee is so reconstituted. 
 (15) If an amendment is suggested under subsection (11)— 
 
(a) 
the Minister may proceed to make such an amendment; or 
 
(b) 
the Minister may report back to the ERD Committee that the Minister is 
unwilling to make the amendment suggested by the ERD Committee and, in 
such a case, the ERD Committee may—

(i) 
resolve that it does not object to the contributions scheme or charge 
scheme (as the case requires); or 
 
(ii) 
resolve to object to the contributions scheme or charge scheme (as 
the case requires). 
 (16) If the ERD Committee resolves to object to the contributions scheme or charge 
scheme (as the case requires), copies of the report furnished to the ERD Committee 
under subsection (7) must be laid before both Houses of Parliament. 
 (17) If either House of Parliament passes a resolution disallowing the contributions scheme 
or charge scheme (as the case requires) after a report has been laid before it under 
subsection (16), then the contributions scheme or charge scheme (as the case requires) 
will cease to have effect. 
 (18) A resolution is not effective for the purposes of subsection (17) unless passed in 
pursuance of a notice of motion given within 14 sitting days (which need not fall 
within the same session of Parliament) after the day on which the relevant report was 
laid before the House. 
 (19) If a resolution is passed under subsection (18), notice of that resolution must 
immediately be published in the Gazette. 
 (20) Subsections (11) to (19) (inclusive) do not apply in a particular case if— 
 
(a) 
the Minister has consulted with the ERD Committee before the contributions 
scheme or charge scheme (as the case requires) has been finalised; and 
 
(b) 
the ERD Committee has resolved, on account of that consultation, that the 
scheme need not be subject to the processes set out in those subsections if or 
when it has been approved by the Governor as part of the relevant funding 
arrangement under subsection (5). 
 (21) In this section— 
prescribed infrastructure means— 
 
(a) 
infrastructure within the ambit of paragraph (i), (j) or (k) of the definition of 
essential infrastructure under section 3(1); or 
 
(b) 
without limiting paragraph (a), infrastructure that relates to the provision of 
public transport; or 
 
(c) 
other infrastructure brought within the ambit of this definition by the 
regulations.

A liability of the Crown arising by virtue of a guarantee under an approved funding 
arrangement is to be paid out of the Consolidated Account (which is appropriated to 
the necessary extent).

An exemption from a tax, levy or local government rate under an approved funding 
arrangement will have effect by force of this section (and despite any other Act).

Subdivision 7—Charges on land 
172—Application of Subdivision 
This Subdivision applies with respect to charges for the purposes of a scheme initiated 
under Subdivision 2. 
173—Creation of charge 
 
(1) 
The Minister may impose a charge under this Subdivision over land within a 
designated growth area. 
 
(2) 
The Minister may impose a charge over land with or without the agreement of the 
owner of the land. 
 
(3) 
For the purpose of the imposition of a charge, the Minister may deliver to the 
Registrar-General a notice, in a form determined by the Registrar-General— 
 
(a) 
setting out or incorporating the terms of the charge; and 
 
(b) 
setting out the real property over which it exists; and 
 
(c) 
requesting the Registrar-General to note the charge against the relevant 
instrument of title or, in the case of land not under the provisions of the Real 
Property Act 1886, against the land. 
 
(4) 
The Registrar-General must, on receipt of a notice under subsection (3), in relation to 
the real property referred to in the notice, enter an appropriate notation in accordance 
with the notice. 
 
(5) 
When an entry is made under subsection (4), a charge over the real property is created. 
 
(6) 
The terms and conditions of the charge may be varied— 
 
(a) 
by the Minister after consultation with the owner of the land to which the 
charge relates (and with or without the agreement of the owner of the land); 
or 
 
(b) 
on account of a periodic review under section 169(2)(a); or 
 
(c) 
in circumstances prescribed by the regulations. 
 
(7) 
A variation under subsection (6) will be effected in a manner determined by the 
Minister after consultation with the Registrar-General. 
 
(8) 
The Minister must, when payments under a charge have been made and paid in full, 
by further notice to the Registrar-General under this section, cancel the charge. 
174—Ranking of charge 
 
(1) 
While a charge exists over real property, the Registrar-General must not register an 
instrument affecting the property unless— 
 
(a) 
the instrument was executed before the charge was created or relates to an 
instrument registered before the charge was created; or 
 
(b) 
the instrument is an instrument of a prescribed class; or 
 
(c) 
the Minister consents to the registration in writing; or 
 
(d) 
the instrument—

(i) 
is expressed to be subject to the charge; and 
 
(ii) 
is not a conveyance that relates to the transfer or sale of the real 
property to a purchaser who intends to occupy the real property for 
residential purposes; or 
 
(e) 
the instrument is a duly stamped conveyance that relates to the transfer or sale 
of the real property under section 175. 
 
(2) 
An instrument registered under subsection (1)(a), (b) or (c) has effect, in relation to 
the charge, as if it had been registered before the charge was created. 
 
(3) 
If an instrument is registered under subsection (1)(e), the charge will be taken to be 
cancelled and the Registrar-General must make the appropriate entries to give effect to 
the cancellation. 
175—Enforcement of charge 
 
(1) 
If a person fails to comply with the terms and conditions of a charge, the charge may 
be enforced as follows: 
 
(a) 
the Minister must, by notice in the Gazette, inform the person of the breach 
and give the person at least 1 month to remedy the breach; 
 
(b) 
if the person does not remedy the breach within the time allowed in a notice 
under paragraph (a), the Minister may proceed to have the land to which the 
charge relates sold. 
 
(2) 
The sale will be by public auction (and the Minister may set a reserve price for the 
purposes of the sale). 
 
(3) 
If, before the date of such an auction, the outstanding amount of the charge and the 
costs incurred by the Minister in proceeding under this section are paid to the 
Minister, the Minister must call off the auction. 
 
(4) 
The requirement to sell at auction does not apply in any circumstances prescribed by 
the regulations. 
 
(5) 
If— 
 
(a) 
an auction fails; or 
 
(b) 
an auction is not required under subsection (4), 
the Minister may sell the land by private contract for the best price that the Minister 
may reasonably obtain. 
 
(6) 
Any money required by the Minister in respect of the sale of land under this section 
will be applied as follows: 
 
(a) 
firstly—in paying the costs of the sale and any other costs of a prescribed 
kind; 
 
(b) 
secondly—in discharging any liabilities secured by instrument registered 
before the charge was created, or that is taken to have such effect by virtue of 
section 174; 
 
(c) 
thirdly—in discharging the amount or amounts secured by the charge; 
 
(d) 
fourthly—in discharging any other liabilities secured by registered 
instruments;

(e) 
fifthly—in discharging any other liabilities that exist in relation to the land of 
which the Minister has notice; 
 
(f) 
sixthly—in payment to the owner of the land. 
 
(7) 
The title obtained under the sale of the land will be free of— 
 
(a) 
any charge under this Subdivision; and 
 
(b) 
all other liabilities discharged under subsection (6); and 
 
(c) 
any other liability that may exist on account of any mortgage, charge or 
encumbrance. 
 
(8) 
If land is sold, an instrument of transfer or conveyance in pursuance of the sale 
executed by the Minister will, on registration or enrolment, operate to vest title to the 
land in the person named in the transfer or conveyance. 
 
(9) 
If it is not reasonably practicable to obtain the duplicate certificate of title to land that 
is sold in pursuance of this section (or other relevant instrument), the 
Registrar-General may register a transfer or conveyance despite the non-production of 
the duplicate (or instrument), but in that event will cancel the existing certificate of 
title for the land and issue a new certificate in the name of the transferee. 
Subdivision 8—Scheme contributions 
176—Application of Subdivision 
 
(1) 
This Subdivision applies in order to raise contributions for the purposes of a scheme 
that is undertaken under this Division. 
 
(2) 
The contributions will apply in relation to an area of the State designated as a 
contribution area by the relevant funding arrangement established under 
Subdivision 6. 
 
(3) 
To avoid doubt, a contribution area under a scheme may overlap with a contribution 
area under another scheme. 
 
(4) 
In a case where subsection (3) applies, the relevant contributions will be collected 
separately and the succeeding provisions of this Subdivision will apply accordingly. 
177—Contributions by constituent councils 
 
(1) 
If this Subdivision applies in relation to a contribution area, the council or councils 
whose areas or parts of whose areas fall within the contribution area (the constituent 
councils) are responsible to make a contribution under this Subdivision based on an 
amount specified by the Minister in accordance with this Subdivision in respect of 
each financial year with respect to which this Subdivision applies. 
 
(2) 
Subject to this section, liability for the amount to be contributed by constituent 
councils will be shared between them— 
 
(a) 
if the charge under section 180 is based on the value of rateable land— 
 
(i) 
unless subparagraph (ii) or (iii) applies, in the proportions that the 
capital value of the rateable land in the contribution area is 
distributed amongst the areas of the councils (and this subparagraph 
applies despite the fact that an individual council uses a different 
basis to impose the charge);

Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002 
 
(ii) 
if all of the constituent councils base their general rates on the site 
value of land—in the proportions that the site value of the rateable 
land in the contribution area is distributed amongst the areas of the 
councils; 
 (iii) if all of the constituent councils base their general rates on the annual 
value of land—in the proportions that the annual value of the 
rateable land in the contribution area is distributed amongst the areas 
of the councils; 
 
(b) 
if the charge is a fixed amount on all rateable land—in proportion to the 
number of rateable properties situated in the area of each council (being 
properties also situated in the contribution area); 
 
(c) 
if the charge is a fixed amount that depends on the purpose for which rateable 
land is used—in proportion to the number of rateable properties used for each 
relevant purpose that are in the area of each council and also in the 
contribution area; 
 
(d) 
if the charge is based on the area of rateable land—in the proportions that the 
area of the rateable land in the contribution area is distributed amongst the 
areas of the councils; 
 
(e) 
if the charge is based on the purpose for which rateable land is used and the 
area of rateable land—in the proportions that the area of the rateable land in 
the contribution area that is used for each purpose is distributed amongst the 
areas of the councils; 
 
(f) 
if the charge is based on the location of rateable land—in proportion to the 
number of rateable properties situated within the location or locations in the 
area of each council (being properties also situated in the contribution area). 
 
(3) 
The Minister may, in connection with the operation of subsection (2), determine that

An amount payable by a council under this section and any interest that accrues in 
respect of that amount is recoverable as a debt in accordance with a scheme prescribed 
by the regulations. 
179—Funds may be expended in subsequent years 
To avoid doubt, if an amount paid by a council under this Subdivision is not spent in 
the financial year in respect of which it was paid, it may be spent in a subsequent 
financial year.

(1) 
In order to reimburse itself for the amounts contributed (or to be contributed) under 
this Subdivision, a council must impose a charge on rateable land in the contribution

(a) 
the funding arrangement established under Subdivision 6; and 
 
(b) 
any determination or direction of the Minister.

Government Act 1999 applies to and in relation to a charge as if it were a separate rate 
under that Chapter. 
 
(4)

provisions apply with respect to the application of Chapter 10 of the Local 
Government Act 1999 to and in relation to a charge: 
 
(a) 
section 154(1), (2) and (4) of that Act will not apply in relation to the charge 
and the basis for the charge will be chosen from the following (as set out in

(ii) 
a fixed charge of the same amount on all rateable land; or 
 (iii) a fixed charge of an amount that depends on the purpose for which 
rateable land is used; or 
 (iv) the area of rateable land; or 
 
(v) 
the purpose for which rateable land is used and the area of the land; 
or 
 (vi) the location of rateable land;

(c) 
if a fixed charge is the basis for the charge under paragraph (a), then 
section 152 of that Act will apply subject to any modifications prescribed by 
the regulations; 
 
(d) 
if relevant, the purposes for which land is used that may be the basis for the 
charge under paragraph (a) will be purposes prescribed by the regulations;

declared more than 1 month before the commencement of a financial year to 
which the charge relates; 
 
(f) 
section 151(5) of that Act will not apply in relation to the charge;

section 156 of that Act will apply (subject to the use of any differentiating 
factor under paragraph (a));

regulations will not apply in relation to the charge;

other respect. 
 
(5) 
To avoid doubt, nothing in subsection (4) prevents the operation of section 158 of the

must contribute under this Subdivision.

For the purposes of this section, if a plan divides a number of existing allotments or 
strata lots into an equal or lesser number of allotments or strata lots, the allotments or 
strata lots into which the land is divided will not be regarded as being new allotments 
or strata lots, and if a plan divides a number of existing allotments or strata lots into a 
greater number of allotments or strata lots, the number by which the greater number of 
allotments or strata lots exceeds the existing number of allotments or strata lots will be 
taken to be the number of new allotments or strata lots created by the plan and, for the 
purpose of determining the area of the new allotments or strata lots, the smallest 
allotment or strata lot delineated on the plan will be regarded as the first of the new 
allotments or strata lots, the next to smallest will be regarded as the second, and so on.

to the extent that an earlier application in respect of the same development has 
addressed the requirements of this section in respect of the area of land as a whole.

a person— 
 
(i) 
who is a party to the relevant proceedings related to a development; 
or 
 
(ii)

has a commercial competitive interest in the proceedings, or has an associate 
who has a commercial competitive interest in the proceedings; and 
 
(b) 
the outcome of the proceedings (including after taking into account any 
appeal) is that the development, or a development in substantially the same 
form, may proceed, 
then the proponent of the development is entitled to recover from the person (the 
defendant) and, if relevant, from any associate of the defendant, as a debt, an amount 
equal to the amount of any loss (including economic loss) that can be reasonably 
assessed as having been suffered by the proponent as a result of delays to the 
development on account of the proceedings if the court is satisfied that the defendant's 
sole or predominant purpose in pursuing the proceedings, or for providing financial 
assistance (as the case may be) was to delay or prevent the development in order to 
obtain commercial benefit for the defendant or an associate of the defendant. 
 
(2) 
A court before which proceedings are brought under subsection (1) may, if it 
considers that it is appropriate to do so, reduce any amount that would otherwise be 
recoverable under that subsection to take into account— 
 
(a) 
any delay in the relevant proceedings reasonably attributable to the actions of 
the proponent of the development or of some other party (other than the 
defendant, an associate of the defendant or a person who has received direct 
or indirect financial assistance from the defendant in connection with those 
proceedings); or 
 
(b) 
any other matter that it considers relevant in the circumstances of the 
particular case. 
 
(3) 
Without in any way limiting the manner in which the purpose of a person may be 
established for the purposes of subsection (1), a person may be taken to have pursued 
proceedings, or to have provided financial assistance to a party to proceedings (as the 
case may be) for a purpose referred to in subsection (1) notwithstanding that, after all 
the evidence has been considered, the existence of that purpose is ascertainable only 
by inference from the conduct of the person or of any other person or from other 
relevant circumstances.

any item or materials incorporated into any building through the performance 
of any building work do not comply with the Building Rules (as modified

offence against the regulations), each director and the chief executive officer of the 
body corporate are guilty of an offence and liable to the same penalty as is prescribed

(3) 
The court must, in determining whether to make an adverse publicity order, take into

the designated entity, elect to be prosecuted for the contravention and the 
person has been allowed not less than 21 days after service of the designated

contravention of any 1 or more of those provisions (provided that the person is not 
liable to pay more than 1 amount as a civil penalty in respect of the same conduct). 
 
(9) 
Proceedings for an order under this section that a person pay an amount as a civil 
penalty in relation to a contravention of this Act, or for enforcement of such an order,

reference to the Governor were a reference to the Minister.

or completed before the relevant day.
