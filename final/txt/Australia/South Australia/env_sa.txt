(2) 
For the purposes of this Act, potential harm includes risk of harm and future harm. 
 
(3) 
For the purposes of this Act, the following provisions are to be applied in determining 
whether environmental harm is material environmental harm or serious 
environmental harm: 
 
(a) 
environmental harm is to be treated as material environmental harm if— 
 
(i) 
it consists of an environmental nuisance of a high impact or on a 
wide scale; or 
 
(ii) 
it involves actual or potential harm to the health or safety of human 
beings that is not trivial, or other actual or potential environmental 
harm (not being merely an environmental nuisance) that is not trivial; 
or 
 (iii) it results in actual or potential loss or property damage of an amount, 
or amounts in aggregate, exceeding $5 000; 
 
(b) 
environmental harm is to be treated as serious environmental harm if— 
 
(i) 
it involves actual or potential harm to the health or safety of human 
beings that is of a high impact or on a wide scale, or other actual or 
potential environmental harm (not being merely an environmental 
nuisance) that is of a high impact or on a wide scale; or 
 
(ii) 
it results in actual or potential loss or property damage of an amount, 
or amounts in aggregate, exceeding $50 000. 
 
(4) 
For the purposes of subsection (3), loss includes the reasonable costs and expenses 
that would be incurred in taking all reasonable and practicable measures to prevent or 
mitigate the environmental harm and to make good resulting environmental damage. 
 
(5) 
For the purposes of this Act, environmental harm is caused by pollution— 
 
(a) 
whether the harm is a direct or indirect result of the pollution; and 
 
(b) 
whether the harm results from the pollution alone or from the combined 
effects of the pollution and other factors. 
5B—Site contamination 
 
(1)

(a) 
chemical substances are present on or below the surface of the site in 
concentrations above the background concentrations (if any); and 
 
(b) 
the chemical substances have, at least in part, come to be present there as a 
result of an activity at the site or elsewhere; and 
 
(c) 
the presence of the chemical substances in those concentrations has resulted 
in— 
 
(i) 
actual or potential harm to the health or safety of human beings that 
is not trivial, taking into account current or proposed land uses; or 
 
(ii) 
actual or potential harm to water that is not trivial; or

Preliminary—Part 1 
 
Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002 
11 
 (iii) other actual or potential environmental harm that is not trivial, taking 
into account current or proposed land uses. 
 
(2) 
For the purposes of this Act, environmental harm is caused by the presence of 
chemical substances— 
 
(a) 
whether the harm is a direct or indirect result of the presence of the chemical 
substances; and 
 
(b) 
whether the harm results from the presence of the chemical substances alone 
or the combined effects of the presence of the chemical substances and other 
factors. 
 
(3) 
For the purposes of this Act, site contamination does not exist at a site if 
circumstances of a kind prescribed by regulation apply to the site. 
5C—Responsibility for pollution 
For the purposes of this Act, the occupier or person in charge of a place or vehicle at 
or from which a pollutant escapes or is discharged, emitted, deposited or disposed of 
will be taken to have polluted the environment with the pollutant (but without 
affecting the liability of any other person in respect of the escape, discharge, emission, 
depositing or disposal of the pollutant). 
5D—Liability for certain offences from vehicles 
 
(1) 
If— 
 
(a) 
an activity is carried on— 
 
(i) 
in, at or from a vehicle; or 
 
(ii) 
in connection with the use of a vehicle; and 
 
(b) 
the activity results in a principal offence, 
the owner of the vehicle is guilty of an offence against this section and is liable to the 
same penalty as is prescribed for the principal offence and the expiation fee (if any) 
that is fixed for the principal offence also applies in relation to the offence against this 
section. 
 
(2) 
However, the owner of a vehicle and the person who committed the principal offence 
(the alleged principal offender) are not both liable through the operation of this 
section to be found guilty of, or to expiate, an offence arising out of the same 
circumstances, and consequently a finding of guilt in relation to, or expiation by, the 
owner exonerates the alleged principal offender and conversely a finding of guilt in 
relation to, or expiation by, the alleged principal offender exonerates the owner. 
 
(3) 
An expiation notice or expiation reminder notice given under the Expiation of 
Offences Act 1996 to the owner of a vehicle for an alleged offence against this section 
involving the vehicle must be accompanied by a notice inviting the owner, if he or she 
was not the alleged principal offender, to provide the issuing authority specified in the 
notice, within the period specified in the notice, with a statutory declaration— 
 
(a) 
setting out the name and address of the person who the owner believes to 
have been the alleged principal offender; or

time of the alleged principal offence and has complied with the Motor 
Vehicles Act 1959 or the Harbors and Navigation Act 1993 (as the case may 
require) in respect of the transfer—setting out details of the transfer 
(including the name and address of the transferee). 
 
(4) 
If the vehicle is owned by 2 or more persons— 
 
(a) 
a prosecution for an offence against this section may be brought against 1 of 
the owners or against some or all of the owners jointly as co-defendants; and 
 
(b) 
if the case for the prosecution is proved and a defence is not established, the 
defendant or each of the defendants who does not establish a defence is liable 
to be found guilty of an offence against this section. 
 
(5) 
Before proceedings are commenced against the owner of a vehicle for an offence 
against this section, the informant must send the owner a notice— 
 
(a) 
setting out particulars of the alleged principal offence; and 
 
(b) 
inviting the owner, if he or she was not the alleged principal offender or the 
owner of the vehicle at the time of the alleged principal offence, to provide 
the informant, within 21 days of the date of the notice, with a statutory 
declaration setting out the matters referred to in subsection (3)(a) and (b). 
 
(6) 
Subsection (5) does not apply to— 
 
(a) 
proceedings commenced where an owner has elected under the Expiation of 
Offences Act 1996 to be prosecuted for the offence; or 
 
(b) 
proceedings commenced against an owner of a vehicle who has been named 
in a statutory declaration under this section as the alleged principal offender. 
 
(7)

against this section, it is a defence to prove— 
 
(a) 
that, in consequence of some unlawful act, the vehicle was not in the 
possession or control of the owner at the time of commission of the alleged 
principal offence; or 
 
(b) 
that the owner provided the informant with a statutory declaration in 
accordance with an invitation under this section. 
 
(8) 
The defence in subsection (7)(b) does not apply if it is proved that the owner made the 
declaration knowing it to be false in a material particular. 
 
(9) 
If— 
 
(a) 
an expiation notice is given to a person named as the alleged principal 
offender in a statutory declaration under this section; or 
 
(b) 
proceedings are commenced against such a person, 
the notice or summons, as the case may be, must be accompanied by a notice setting 
out particulars of the statutory declaration that named the person as the alleged 
principal offender. 
 (10) The particulars of the statutory declaration provided to the alleged principal offender 
must not include the address of the person who provided the statutory declaration.

(1) 
A person must not undertake an activity that pollutes, or might pollute, the 
environment unless the person takes all reasonable and practicable measures to 
prevent or minimise any resulting environmental harm. 
 
(2) 
In determining what measures are required to be taken under subsection (1), regard is 
to be had, amongst other things, to— 
 
(a) 
the nature of the pollution or potential pollution and the sensitivity of the 
receiving environment; and 
 
(b) 
the financial implications of the various measures that might be taken as those 
implications relate to the class of persons undertaking activities of the same 
or a similar kind; and 
 
(c) 
the current state of technical knowledge and likelihood of successful 
application of the various measures that might be taken. 
 
(3) 
In any proceedings (civil or criminal), where it is alleged that a person failed to 
comply with the duty under this section by polluting the environment, it will be a 
defence— 
 
(a) 
if— 
 
(i) 
maximum pollution levels were fixed for the particular pollutant and 
form of pollution concerned by mandatory provisions of an 
environment protection policy or conditions of an environmental 
authorisation held by the person, or both; and 
 
(ii) 
it is proved that the person did not by so polluting the environment 
contravene the mandatory provisions or conditions; or 
 
(b) 
if— 
 
(i) 
an environment protection policy or conditions of an environmental 
authorisation provided that compliance with specified provisions of 
the policy or with specified conditions of the authorisation would 
satisfy the duty under this section in relation to the form of pollution 
concerned; and 
 
(ii) 
it is proved that the person complied with the provisions or with such 
conditions of an environmental authorisation held by the person. 
 
(4) 
Failure to comply with the duty under this section does not of itself constitute an 
offence, but— 
 
(a) 
compliance with the duty may be enforced by the issuing of an environment 
protection order; and 
 
(b) 
a clean-up order or clean-up authorisation may be issued, or an order may be 
made by the Environment, Resources and Development Court under Part 11, 
in respect of non-compliance with the duty; and 
 
(c) 
failure to comply with the duty will be taken to be a contravention of this Act 
for the purposes of section 135.

accept a Commonwealth Act document as an application, notice or other 
document for the purposes of this Act if (subject to subsection (5)) the 
document complies with the requirements of this Act; and

direct that a procedure taken under the Commonwealth Act in relation to a 
Commonwealth Act document that has been accepted by the Authority under

in relation to the relevant document under this Act if the requirements of this 
Act in relation to the procedure have been complied with; and 
 
(c) 
instead of the Authority, or some other person, preparing a plan, report, 
statement, assessment or other document under this Act, adopt or accept the

of the Commonwealth Act as the document required under this Act if (subject 
to subsection (5)) the document has been prepared in compliance with this 
Act and complies with the requirements of this Act. 
 
(3)

or part of an activity, or includes an activity, for which an environmental authorisation 
is required under this Act, the Authority may, when considering an application for an 
environmental authorisation, or for the variation of an environmental authorisation, for 
the activity, use information and other material provided to the Commonwealth 
Minister under the Commonwealth Act for the purpose of deciding whether to give his 
or her approval to the controlled action under that Act. 
 
(4) 
Where a controlled action under the Commonwealth Act is an activity or part of an 
activity, or includes an activity, for which an environmental authorisation is required 
under this Act, the Authority—

obligation to do something is to be regarded as continuing regardless of the fact that 
any period within which, or time before which, the act is required to be done has 
expired or passed.

Interpretation and application—Division 1 
Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002 
1 
Part 10A—Special provisions and enforcement powers for site 
contamination 
Division 1—Interpretation and application 
103A—Interpretation 
In this Part— 
occupier, in relation to land— 
 
(a) 
has the meaning assigned to the term by section 3; and 
 
(b) 
if, in accordance with the regulations, a person of a particular kind is to be 
taken to be an occupier of the land in the circumstances of the case—includes 
a person of that kind, 
and occupy land has a corresponding meaning.  
103B—Application of Part to site contamination 
This Part applies to site contamination at a site whether the chemical substances were 
first present there, or the environmental harm resulted, before or after the 
commencement of this Part or this Act. 
Division 2—Appropriate persons to be issued with orders and liability 
for site contamination 
103C—General provisions as to appropriate persons 
 
(1) 
Subject to this Part, the appropriate person to be issued with a site contamination 
assessment order or a site remediation order in respect of a site under Division 3 is— 
 
(a) 
the person who caused the site contamination at the site; or 
 
(b) 
if it is not practicable to issue the order to that person, the owner of the site 
provided that— 
 
(i) 
before the person acquired the site, the person knew, or ought 
reasonably to have been aware, that chemical substances were 
present, or likely to be present, on or below the surface of the site 
such as to require, or be likely to require, remediation; or 
 
(ii) 
— 
 (A) before the person acquired the site, the person knew, or 
ought reasonably to have been aware, that the activity that 
caused the site contamination at the site had been carried on 
at the site, or while the person was the owner, the person 
knew, or ought reasonably to have been aware, that the 
activity that caused the site contamination at the site was 
being carried on at the site; and 
 
(B) 
the activity is an activity of a kind prescribed by the 
regulations as a potentially contaminating activity.

Division 2—Appropriate persons to be issued with orders and liability for site contamination 
2 
Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002 
 
(2) 
However, if the basis for issuing a site contamination assessment order is only the 
Authority's suspicion under section 103H(1)(b) as to the existence of site 
contamination at the site, subsection (1) of this section does not apply and the 
appropriate person to be issued with the order is the owner of the site. 
 
(3) 
For the purposes of subsection (1), it is not practicable to issue a site contamination 
assessment order or a site remediation order to a person if the person— 
 
(a) 
has died or, in the case of a body corporate, ceased to exist; or 
 
(b) 
cannot, after reasonable inquiry, be identified or located; or 
 
(c) 
would, in the opinion of the Authority, for any reason, be unable to carry out, 
or meet the costs and expenses of, the action required or authorised under the 
order. 
103D—Causing site contamination 
 
(1) 
For the purposes of this Act, a person is to be taken to have caused site contamination 
if the person was the occupier of land when there was an activity at the land that 
caused or contributed to the site contamination. 
 
(2) 
If site contamination would not have resulted at a site but for a change of use of a kind 
prescribed by regulation (whether the change occurred before or after the 
commencement of this Part or this Act), the person who brought about the change of 
use of the site is to be taken to have caused the site contamination for the purposes of 
this Act. 
 
(3) 
The operation of subsection (2) in a particular case is not to be taken to exclude the 
possibility of another person or persons also having caused the site contamination 
under subsection (1). 
 
(4) 
For the purposes of subsection (2), a person does not bring about a change of use of a 
site because the person was a relevant authority that granted a consent or approval in 
respect of the site under the Planning, Development and Infrastructure Act 2016. 
103E—Liability for site contamination subject to certain agreements 
 
(1) 
If— 
 
(a) 
site contamination exists at a site; and 
 
(b) 
land that is all or portion of the site has been sold or transferred (whether 
before or after the commencement of this Part or this Act) subject to an 
agreement in writing under which the purchaser or transferee will assume 
liability for all or a specified part of the site contamination at the site, 
the purchaser or transferee is to be taken to have assumed the vendor's or transferor's 
liability for the site contamination in accordance with the agreement and this Act 
applies as if the purchaser or transferee (and not the vendor or transferor) had caused 
the site contamination or, as the case may be, the specified part of the site 
contamination. 
 
(2) 
Subsection (1) does not apply to an agreement— 
 
(a) 
unless, in the case of an agreement entered into after the commencement of 
this Part—

Appropriate persons to be issued with orders and liability for site contamination—Division 2 
Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002 
3 
 
(i) 
the person has first given the purchaser or transferee a notice in a 
form approved by the Authority for the purposes of this section 
setting out the legal effect of the agreement under this section; and 
 
(ii) 
a copy of the agreement is lodged with the Authority; or 
 
(b) 
if the Environment, Resources and Development Court determines, on 
application by the Authority, that the purchaser or transferee did not acquire 
the land in a genuine arms length transaction. 
103F—Order may be issued to one or more appropriate persons 
If, in the application of this Division, there are 2 or more persons to whom it is 
practicable to issue an order under Division 3 as appropriate persons, the Authority 
may determine that— 
 
(a) 
any 1 of the persons is the appropriate person to be issued with the order; or 
 
(b) 
2 or more of the persons are the appropriate persons to be issued with the 
order (with the effect that the persons are jointly and severally liable to 
comply with the requirements of the order). 
103G—Court may order that director of body is appropriate person in certain 
circumstances 
 
(1) 
If— 
 
(a) 
a body corporate has been issued with a site contamination assessment order 
or a site remediation order in respect of a site, or grounds exist for the issuing 
of any such order to a body corporate; and 
 
(b) 
there is reason to believe that the body corporate is being or has been wound 
up, stripped of assets or subjected to other action as part of a scheme— 
 
(i) 
to avoid meeting its obligations under or in connection with a site 
contamination assessment order or a site remediation order in respect 
of the site; or 
 
(ii) 
to avoid its being issued with such an order, 
the Environment, Resources and Development Court may, on application by the 
Authority, make an order that a person who was, during the period in which it appears 
to the Court that the scheme was principally devised, a director or otherwise 
concerned in the management of the body corporate, or of a holding company of the 
body corporate, is an appropriate person to be issued with a site contamination 
assessment order or a site remediation order, or both, in respect of the site. 
 
(2) 
Without limiting the effect of subsection (1), there will be reason for such a belief— 
 
(a) 
if— 
 
(i) 
the body corporate is being or has been wound up; and 
 
(ii) 
the body corporate has carried out 1 or more transactions— 
 (A) such as to give the liquidator of the body corporate a right to 
recover cash under section 567 of the Corporations 
Act 2001 of the Commonwealth; or

 (iii) there was, at the time or times when the body corporate entered those 
transactions or a substantial portion of them, reason to believe that 
site contamination may exist at the site; or 
 
(b) 
if— 
 
(i) 
a holding company of the body corporate has contravened section 
588V of the Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth in relation 
to the body corporate; and 
 
(ii) 
there was, at the time of the contravention, reason to believe that site 
contamination may exist at the site; or 
 
(c) 
if— 
 
(i) 
the site has been transferred to a related body corporate (the 
transferee); and 
 
(ii) 
a reasonable person could have anticipated that the transferee would 
be unable to pay its debts if it took steps to remediate the site (to the 
extent that a reasonable person would have expected would be 
necessary); and 
 (iii) there was, at the time of the transfer or when the body corporate 
entered the transactions for the transfer, or a substantial portion of 
them, reason to believe that site contamination may exist at the site. 
 
(3) 
The Court must not make an order under this section if the person against whom the 
order would be made satisfies the Court that— 
 
(a) 
the person had no knowledge, actual, imputed or constructive, of the scheme 
or any element of the scheme; or 
 
(b) 
the person was not in a position to influence the conduct of the body 
corporate in relation to that scheme; or 
 
(c) 
the person, if in such a position, used all due diligence to prevent the pursuit 
of the scheme by the body corporate. 
 
(4) 
The Court may make an order under this section despite the fact that the body 
corporate took steps to remediate the site.

the Authority may issue a site contamination assessment order in respect of the site to 
an appropriate person. 
 
(2) 
A site contamination assessment order— 
 
(a) 
must be in the form of a written notice served on the person to whom it is 
issued; and 
 
(b) 
must specify the person to whom it is issued (whether by name or a 
description sufficient to identify the person); and

prepare the written report or the assessments; and 
 
(g) 
may include a requirement for a site contamination audit to be carried out, in 
accordance with the guidelines issued from time to time by the Authority, and 
a site contamination audit report to be submitted to the Authority within a 
specified period; and 
 
(h) 
may include a requirement for specified consultations to be carried out with 
owners or occupiers of land in the vicinity of the site; and 
 
(i)

Resources and Development Court against the order. 
 
(3) 
If the order is issued to an appropriate person as an owner of the site as distinct from a 
person who caused the site contamination, the order must be limited in its application 
to site contamination on or below the surface of the site. 
 
(4) 
Where a proposed site contamination assessment order or a proposed variation of such 
an order would require the undertaking of an activity for which a permit would, but 
for section 106 of the Landscape South Australia Act 2019, be required under that Act, 
the Authority must, before issuing or varying the order, give notice of the proposal to 
the authority under the Landscape South Australia Act 2019 to whom an application 
for a permit for the activity would otherwise have to be made inviting the authority to 
make written submission in relation to the proposal within a period specified in the 
notice. 
 
(5) 
The Authority may, by written notice served on a person to whom a site contamination 
assessment order has been issued, vary or revoke the order.

(7) 
It is not an excuse for a person to refuse or fail to provide information in response to a 
requirement imposed by a site contamination assessment order on the ground that to 
do so might tend to incriminate the person or make the person liable to a penalty. 
 
(8) 
If compliance by a prescribed person with a requirement to provide information 
imposed by a site contamination assessment order might tend to incriminate the 
person or make the person liable to a penalty, then the information given in 
compliance with the requirement is not admissible in evidence against the person in 
proceedings for an offence or for the imposition of a penalty (other than proceedings 
in respect of the making of a false or misleading statement). 
103I—Voluntary site contamination assessment proposals 
 
(1) 
The Authority may agree not to issue a site contamination assessment order to a 
person in relation to known or suspected site contamination if the person undertakes to 
carry out an assessment in accordance with an approved voluntary site contamination 
assessment proposal. 
 
(2) 
An agreement under subsection (1) must be in writing and copies of the agreement 
must be served on the parties to the agreement.

Court under Part 11 for an order for payment of the whole or a portion of the costs and 
expenses of the assessment against others as if the person had carried out the 
assessment in compliance with the requirements of a site contamination assessment 
order.

An emergency site remediation order may be issued orally, but, in that event, the 
person to whom the order is issued must be advised forthwith of the person's right to 
appeal to the Environment, Resources and Development Court against the order. 
 
(7) 
Where an emergency site remediation order is issued to a person, the order will cease 
to have effect on the expiration of 72 hours from the time of its issuing unless 
confirmed by a written site remediation order issued by the Authority and served on 
the person. 
 
(8) 
The Authority or an authorised officer may, if of the opinion that it is reasonably 
necessary to do so in the circumstances, include in an emergency or other site 
remediation order a requirement for an act or omission that might otherwise constitute 
a contravention of this Act and, in that event, a person incurs no criminal liability 
under this Act for compliance with the requirement. 
 
(9) 
The Authority may, by written notice served on a person to whom a site remediation 
order has been issued, vary or revoke the order. 
 (10) Where, in accordance with subsection (2)(g), a site remediation order is issued 
authorising a person other than an authorised officer to take action, the following 
provisions apply: 
 
(a) 
the Authority must issue the person with an instrument of authority; 
 
(b) 
the person may exercise such powers of an authorised officer as are 
reasonably required for the purpose of taking action under that subsection; 
 
(c) 
the provisions of this Act apply in relation to the exercise of such powers by 
the person in the same way as in relation to an authorised officer; 
 
(d) 
the person must produce the instrument of authority for the inspection of any 
person in relation to whom the person intends to exercise powers of an 
authorised officer.

Maximum penalty:  
 
(a) 
in the case of a body corporate—$120 000; 
 
(b) 
in the case of a natural person—$60 000.

requirement imposed by a site remediation order on the ground that to do so might 
tend to incriminate the person or make the person liable to a penalty. 
 (13) If compliance by a prescribed person with a requirement to provide information 
imposed by a site remediation order might tend to incriminate the person or make the 
person liable to a penalty, then the information given in compliance with the 
requirement is not admissible in evidence against the person in proceedings for an 
offence or for the imposition of a penalty (other than proceedings in respect of the 
making of a false or misleading statement).

Court under Part 11 for an order for payment of the whole or a portion of the costs and 
expenses of the remediation against others as if the person had carried out the 
remediation in compliance with the requirements of a site remediation order. 
103L—Entry onto land by person to whom order is issued 
 
(1) 
A site contamination assessment order or a site remediation order does not confer on 
the person to whom it is issued a power to enter land of which that person is not an 
occupier, to remain on such land or to do anything on such land, without the 
permission of— 
 
(a) 
the occupier of the land; and 
 
(b) 
the owner of the land (unless the order has been issued to the owner or the 
occupier is the owner). 
 
(2) 
However— 
 
(a) 
if permission is withheld or withdrawn by the owner, the Authority may— 
 
(i) 
revoke, suspend or vary the order; and

if the owner has been warned of the possible consequences of 
withholding or withdrawing permission, issue a site contamination 
assessment order or a site remediation order in respect of the land to 
the owner as if the owner were the appropriate person; 
 
(b) 
if permission is withheld or withdrawn by the occupier, the Authority may— 
 
(i)

 (11) An application may be made without notice to any person and, if the Court is satisfied 
on the application that the respondent has a case to answer, it may grant permission to 
the applicant to serve a summons requiring the respondent to appear before the Court 
to show cause why an order should not be made under this section. 
 (12) An application under this section must, in the first instance, be referred to a 
conference under section 16 of the Environment, Resources and Development Court 
Act 1993 (and the provisions of that Act will then apply in relation to the application). 
 (13) If, on an application under this section or before the determination of the proceedings 
commenced by the application, the Court is satisfied that, in order to preserve the 
rights or interests of parties to the proceedings or for any other reason, it is desirable to 
make an interim order under this section, the Court may make such an order. 
 (14) An interim order— 
 
(a) 
may be made on an application without notice to any person; and 
 
(b) 
may be made whether or not the proceedings have been referred to a 
conference; and 
 
(c) 
will be made subject to such conditions as the Court thinks fit; and 
 
(d) 
will not operate after the proceedings in which it is made are finally 
determined. 
 (15) Where the Court makes an order requiring the respondent to take any specified action 
to make good any environmental damage or to prevent or mitigate further 
environmental harm, the provisions of Division 4 of Part 10 relating to— 
 
(a) 
registration of a clean-up order in relation to land; and 
 
(b) 
the taking of action by the Authority on non-compliance with a clean-up 
order; and 
 
(c) 
the recovery of costs and expenses by the Authority, 
apply in relation to the Court's order in the same way as in relation to a clean-up order 
issued by the Authority under that Division. 
 (16) The Court may, if it thinks fit, adjourn proceedings under this section in order to 
permit the respondent to make an application for an environmental authorisation that 
should have been but was not made, or to remedy any other default.

Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002 
 (17) The Court may order an applicant in proceedings under this section— 
 
(a) 
to provide security for the payment of costs that may be awarded against the 
applicant if the application is subsequently dismissed; 
 
(b) 
to give an undertaking as to the payment of any amount that may be awarded 
against the applicant under subsection (18). 
 (18) If, on an application under this section alleging a contravention of this Act or a 
repealed environment law, the Court is satisfied— 
 
(a) 
that the respondent has not contravened this Act or a repealed environment 
law; and 
 
(b) 
that the respondent has suffered loss or damage as a result of the actions of 
the applicant; and 
 
(c) 
that in the circumstances it is appropriate to make an order under this 
provision, 
the Court may, on the application of the respondent (and in addition to any order as to 
costs), require the applicant to pay to the respondent an amount, determined by the 
Court, to compensate the respondent for the loss or damage suffered by the 
respondent. 
 (19) The Court may, if it considers it appropriate to do so, either on its own initiative or on 
the application of a party, vary or revoke an order previously made under this section. 
 (20) Proceedings under this section based on a contravention of this Act or a repealed 
environment law may be commenced at any time within three years after the date of 
the alleged contravention or, with the authorisation of the Attorney-General, at any 
later time. 
 (21) An apparently genuine document purporting to be under the hand of the 
Attorney-General and to authorise the commencement of proceedings under this 
section will be accepted in any legal proceedings, in the absence of proof to the 
contrary, as proof of the authorisation. 
 (22) The Court may, in any proceedings under this section, make such orders in relation to 
the costs of the proceedings as it thinks just and reasonable. 
 (23) Without limiting the generality of subsection (22), in determining whether to make 
any order in relation to costs the Court may have regard to the following matters (so 
far as they are relevant): 
 
(a) 
whether the applicant is pursuing a personal interest only in bringing the 
proceedings or is furthering a wider group interest or the public interest; 
 
(b) 
whether or not the proceedings raise significant issues relating to the 
administration of this Act. 
104A—Authority may recover civil penalty in respect of contravention 
 
(1) 
Subject to this section, if the Authority is satisfied that a person has committed an 
offence by contravening a provision of this Act, the Authority may, as an alternative 
to criminal proceedings, recover, by negotiation or by application to the Environment, 
Resources and Development Court, an amount as a civil penalty in respect of the 
contravention.

Civil remedies and penalties—Part 11 
 
Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002

(2) 
The Authority may not recover an amount under this section in respect of a 
contravention if the relevant offence requires proof of intention or some other state of 
mind, and must, in respect of any other contravention, determine whether to initiate 
proceedings for an offence or take action under this section, having regard to the 
seriousness of the contravention, the previous record of the offender and any other 
relevant factors. 
 
(3) 
The Authority may not make an application to the Court under this section to recover 
an amount from a person as a civil penalty in respect of a contravention— 
 
(a) 
unless the Authority has served on the person a notice in the prescribed form 
advising the person that the person may, by written notice to the Authority, 
elect to be prosecuted for the contravention and the person has been allowed 
not less than 21 days after service of the Authority's notice to make such an 
election; or 
 
(b) 
if the person serves written notice on the Authority, before the making of 
such an application, that the person elects to be prosecuted for the 
contravention. 
 
(4) 
The maximum amount that the Authority may recover by negotiation as a civil penalty 
in respect of a contravention is— 
 
(a) 
the amount specified by this Act as the criminal penalty in relation to that 
contravention; or 
 
(b) 
$120 000, 
whichever is the lesser. 
 
(5) 
If, on an application by the Authority, the Environment, Resources and Development 
Court is satisfied on the balance of probabilities that a person has contravened a 
provision of this Act, the Court may order the person to pay to the Authority an 
amount as a civil penalty (but not exceeding the amount specified by this Act as the 
criminal penalty in relation to that contravention). 
 
(6) 
In determining the amount to be paid by a person as a civil penalty, the Court must 
have regard to— 
 
(a) 
the nature and extent of the contravention; and 
 
(b) 
any environmental harm or detriment to the public interest resulting from the 
contravention; and 
 
(c) 
any financial saving or other benefit that the person stood to gain by 
committing the contravention; and 
 
(d) 
whether the person has previously been found, in proceedings under this Act, 
to have engaged in any similar conduct; and 
 
(e) 
any other matter it considers relevant. 
 
(7) 
The jurisdiction conferred by this section is to be part of the civil jurisdiction of the 
Court. 
 
(8) 
If conduct of a person constitutes a contravention of two or more provisions of this 
Act, an amount may be recovered from the person under this section in relation to the 
contravention of any one or more of those provisions (provided that the person is not 
liable to pay more than one amount as a civil penalty in respect of the same conduct).

(9) 
Proceedings for an order under this section that a person pay an amount as a civil 
penalty in relation to a contravention of this Act, or for enforcement of such an order, 
are stayed if criminal proceedings are started or have already been started against the 
person for an offence constituted by conduct that is substantially the same as the 
conduct alleged to constitute the contravention. 
 (10) Proceedings referred to in subsection (9) may only be resumed if the criminal 
proceedings do not result in a formal finding of guilt being made against the person. 
 (11) Evidence of information given or evidence of the production of documents by a 
person is not admissible in criminal proceedings against the person if— 
 
(a) 
the person gave the evidence or produced the documents in the course of 
negotiations or proceedings under this section for the recovery of an amount 
as a civil penalty in relation to a contravention of this Act; and 
 
(b) 
the conduct alleged to constitute the offence is substantially the same as the 
conduct that was alleged to constitute the contravention. 
 (12) However, subsection (11) does not apply to criminal proceedings in respect of the 
making of a false or misleading statement. 
 (13) Proceedings for an order under this section may be commenced at any time within 
three years after the date of the alleged contravention or, with the authorisation of the 
Attorney-General, at any later time within 10 years after the date of the alleged 
contravention. 
 (14) An apparently genuine document purporting to be under the hand of the 
Attorney-General and to authorise the commencement of proceedings for an order 
under this section will be accepted in any legal proceedings, in the absence of proof to 
the contrary, as proof of the authorisation. 
 (15) The Court may, in any proceedings under this section, make such orders in relation to 
the costs of the proceedings as it thinks just and reasonable.
