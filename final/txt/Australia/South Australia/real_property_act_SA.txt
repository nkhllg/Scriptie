establish his or her title to the estate or interest claimed, and give written notice 
thereof to the Registrar-General, or shall have obtained from the Court an order or

(2) 
A caveat under this section— 
 
(a) 
shall state the nature of the estate or interest claimed by the person lodging it 
and shall give an address at which notices and proceedings relating to the 
caveat may be served; 
 
(b) 
need not be in any particular form but shall be accepted by the 
Registrar-General if it gives reasonable notice of the claim of the caveator. 
 
(3) 
If the Registrar-General is satisfied that the caveator is the registered proprietor of the 
land to which the application relates, or has an estate or interest in that land derived 
under or through the registered proprietor, he shall refuse the application: 
Provided that the Registrar-General shall not refuse an application solely on the 
ground that a person is entitled to an easement in or over the said land, but if a person 
is so entitled the Registrar-General may include in any certificate of title issued to the 
applicant a statement that the land is subject to the easement. 
 
(4) 
If the Registrar-General is not satisfied that the caveator is the registered proprietor of

proprietor, he shall give notice to the caveator that the caveator is required to take

entitled to an estate or interest derived under or through the registered proprietor. 
80G—Power to issue certificates 
Upon or after the expiration of the time fixed by the notice under section 80E of this 
Act, if the Registrar-General is satisfied that the possession on which the applicant 
relies would, if the land had not been subject to this Act, have conferred on the 
applicant a title by possession, he may issue to the applicant a certificate for an estate 
in fee simple or for any other estate acquired by the applicant, free from all 
encumbrances appearing by the Register Book to affect the existing title: Provided 
that where a caveat has been lodged against the granting of an application the

particulars.

Part 13A—Priority notices 
154A—Person who intends to lodge instrument may lodge priority notice 
 
(1) 
A person who intends to lodge an instrument may, on payment of the prescribed fee, 
lodge in the Lands Titles Registration Office a notice (a priority notice) for the 
purpose of giving priority to 1 or more instruments relevant to the same conveyancing 
transaction. 
 
(2) 
A priority notice must— 
 
(a) 
be in the appropriate form; and 
 
(b) 
identify the instruments to which priority is to be given; and 
 
(c) 
specify the order in which priority is to be given to the instruments identified 
in the notice; and 
 
(d) 
identify the land to which the notice relates; and 
 
(e) 
include any other information, or be accompanied by any other document, 
required by the Registrar-General. 
 
(3) 
A priority notice may give priority to an instrument to be lodged by the person who 
lodged the notice or by another person. 
 
(4) 
If a priority notice identifies more than 1 instrument, priority under this Part will only 
be given to an instrument identified in the notice if all of the identified instruments are 
lodged in the Lands Titles Registration Office at the same time. 
 
(5) 
Subject to subsection (13), a priority notice comes into force when it is lodged and 
remains in force until it ceases to have effect in accordance with this Part. 
 
(6) 
If a priority notice is lodged in the Lands Titles Registration Office in relation to land, 
nothing prevents the lodgement of a further priority notice in relation to the same land 
by the person who lodged the earlier notice or by a different person. 
 
(7) 
A second or subsequent priority notice lodged in relation to land— 
 
(a) 
may identify 1 or more of the same instruments as identified in an earlier 
notice (even if the earlier notice is in force); and 
 
(b) 
may identify instruments that have not been identified in an earlier notice. 
 
(8) 
If 2 or more priority notices are in force in relation to particular land, the notices are 
entitled to priority according to the order in which they were lodged in the Lands 
Titles Registration Office. 
 
(9) 
A person lodging a priority notice is not required to provide evidence in support of the 
content of the notice or his or her eligibility to lodge the notice (but the 
Registrar-General may require verification of the person's identity in accordance with 
the verification of identity requirements). 
 (10) The Registrar-General is not required to inquire into the content of a priority notice in 
order to determine whether that content is correct. 
 (11) If a priority notice is lodged, the Registrar-General— 
 
(a) 
must—

(i) 
record on the notice the time of receipt of the notice; and 
 
(ii) 
make a record of lodgement of the notice in the Register Book or, if 
appropriate, the Register of Crown Leases; but 
 
(b) 
is not required to advise the registered proprietor of the land to which the 
priority notice relates, or any other person, that the notice has been lodged. 
 (12) The Registrar-General may determine that a person is a vexatious lodger of priority 
notices. 
 (13) A priority notice lodged by a person in relation to whom a determination has been 
made by the Registrar-General under subsection (12) may be rejected by the 
Registrar-General and, in that case, the notice is of no effect. 
 (14) A priority notice may be lodged in relation to— 
 
(a) 
land wholly comprised in a single certificate of title; or 
 
(b) 
land comprised in more than 1 certificate of title; or 
 
(c) 
a portion of the land comprised in a certificate of title. 
154B—Effect of priority notices 
 
(1) 
If an instrument affecting land is lodged in the Lands Titles Registration Office or 
served on the Registrar-General while a priority notice is in force in relation to the 
land, the instrument may not be registered or recorded in the Register Book or the 
Register of Crown Leases until the priority notice ceases to have effect. 
 
(2) 
However, a priority notice in force in relation to land does not prevent the 
Registrar-General from registering, recording or giving effect to the following in 
relation to the land: 
 
(a) 
an instrument identified in the priority notice as an instrument to which 
priority is to be given (provided the instruments identified in the notice are 
lodged in accordance with section 154A(4)); 
 
(b) 
any other instrument with the written consent of the person who lodged the 
priority notice; 
 
(c) 
the receipt, removal, extension or withdrawal of a caveat; 
 
(d) 
a statutory order or the cancellation of a statutory order; 
 
(e) 
a statutory authorisation or the cancellation of a statutory authorisation; 
 
(f)

(3) 
If, in the opinion of the Registrar-General, it is apparent from the information included 
in a priority notice that the notice is intended to give priority to a particular 
instrument, but the instrument is not accurately identified in the notice, the 
Registrar-General may nevertheless give priority to the instrument as if it had been so 
identified. 
 
(4) 
Lodgement of a priority notice in relation to a portion of the land comprised in a 
certificate of title where the land is the subject of a plan of division or a plan of 
community division that has not been deposited by the Registrar-General does not 
prevent the Registrar-General from dealing with the application for the division of the 
land to which the plan relates.

effect to any valid appointment of a new trustee or new trustees. And so far as shall be
