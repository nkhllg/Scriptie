Landlord and Tenant Act 1936—1.7.2020 
Part A1—Preliminary 
 
4 
Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002 
The Parliament of South Australia enacts as follows: 
Part A1—Preliminary 
1—Short title 
This Act may be cited as the Landlord and Tenant Act 1936. 
3A—Act does not apply to residential tenancy agreements 
This Act shall not apply to or in relation to any residential tenancy agreement within 
the meaning of the Residential Tenancies Act 1978 to which that Act applies. 
3B—Application of Act to Crown 
This Act binds the Crown. 
Part 1—Forfeiture and relief 
Division 1—Recovery of premises 
4—Proceedings by landlord for non-payment of rent 
 
(1) 
In every case between a landlord and tenant, if— 
 
(a) 
one half-year's rent is in arrear; and 
 
(b) 
the landlord has by law the right to re-enter for non-payment thereof, 
the landlord may bring an action for recovery of the demised premises without making 
any formal demand for the rent or any re-entry, and the service of the writ in that 
action shall have the effect of a demand and re-entry. 
 
(2) 
If the lessee or his assignees or other person claiming or deriving under the lease 
permits and suffers judgment to be recovered in the action and execution to be 
executed thereon without paying the rent and arrears together with full costs and 
without proceeding for relief on equitable grounds within six months after such 
execution executed, the said lessee, his assignees, and all other persons claiming under 
the lease shall be barred and foreclosed from all relief or remedy legal or equitable 
other than by appeal, and the landlord shall thereafter hold the demised premises 
discharged from the lease. 
 
(3) 
Nothing in this section shall bar the right of any mortgagee of the lease or any part 
thereof who is not in possession, if such mortgagee within six months after such 
execution executed pays all rent in arrear, and all costs and damages sustained by the 
landlord, and performs all the covenants and agreements which on the part and behalf 
of the first lessee are and ought to be performed. 
5—Tenant, paying all rent, proceedings to cease 
If the tenant or his assignee at any time before the hearing of the action for recovery of 
the land pays or tenders to the landlord, or his executors, or administrators, or his or 
their solicitor in the action or pays into the court all the rent and arrears due at the time 
of such payment, together with the costs, all further proceedings in the action shall 
thereupon cease and be discontinued.

Forfeiture and relief—Part 1 
Recovery of premises—Division 1 
Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002 
5 
6—Damages for mesne profits 
 
(1) 
On the hearing of any action brought by a landlord against a tenant for recovery of the 
demised premises the judge, if satisfied that the defendant has been served with due 
notice of the hearing, shall, whether the defendant appears on the trial or not, permit 
the plaintiff, after proof of his right to recover possession of the whole or of any part 
of the demised land, to adduce evidence of the mesne profits thereof, which accrued or 
might have accrued from the day of the expiration or determination of the tenant's 
interest in the land, down to the time of the judgment given in the action, or to some 
preceding day to be specially mentioned therein; and judgment shall be given upon the 
whole matter, both as to the recovery of the whole or any part of the land, and also as 
to the amount of the damages to be paid for such mesne profits; and in such case the 
landlord shall have judgment, not only for the recovery of possession and costs, but 
also for the mesne profits found. 
 
(2) 
Nothing in this section shall be construed to bar any landlord from bringing any action 
for the mesne profits which accrue from the time of the judgment or the day so 
specified therein, down to the day of the delivery of possession of the premises 
recovered in the action. 
7—Saving of former remedies 
Nothing in the preceding three sections shall prejudice or affect any other right of 
action or remedy which landlords possess in any of the cases provided for, in these 
sections, except as therein expressly enacted. 
8—Notice of writs by lessee to landlord 
Every tenant to whom there is delivered any writ for the recovery of the premises 
demised to or held by him, or to whose knowledge any such writ comes, shall (except 
where the landlord is the plaintiff named in the writ) forthwith give notice thereof to 
the landlord or his agent; and if he fails to do so shall be liable to forfeit to the person 
of whom he holds the premises an amount equal to the value of three years improved 
or rack rent of the premises, to be recovered by action in any court having jurisdiction 
in respect of claims for that amount. 
Division 2—Relief against forfeiture 
9—Relief against forfeiture for non-payment of rent 
 
(1) 
In the case of any action in the Supreme Court for recovery of land on forfeiture for 
non-payment of rent, the court or a judge may, upon summons, give relief on equitable 
grounds in a summary manner, up to and within the same time after execution 
executed, and subject to the same terms and conditions in all respects as to payment of 
rent, costs, and otherwise, as would have applied in the Supreme Court in its equitable 
jurisdiction before the passing of the Supreme Court Act 1878. 
 
(2) 
If the lessee, his executors, administrators, or assigns are so relieved, they shall hold 
the demised lands according to the terms of the lease and without any new lease. 
 
(3) 
If such relief is granted, the court or judge shall direct a minute thereof to be made, by 
endorsement on the lease or otherwise.

10—No re-entry till notice to tenant to remedy breach 
A right of re-entry or forfeiture under any proviso or stipulation in a lease for a breach 
of any covenant or condition in the lease shall not be enforceable by action or 
otherwise, unless and until— 
 
(a) 
the lessor serves on the lessee a notice specifying the particular breach 
complained of, and, if the breach is capable of remedy, requiring the lessee to 
remedy the breach, and in any case requiring the lessee to make compensation 
in money for the breach; and 
 
(b) 
the lessee fails within a reasonable time thereafter to remedy the breach, if it 
is capable of remedy, and to make reasonable compensation in money to the 
satisfaction of the lessor for the breach. 
11—Court or judge may grant relief 
 
(1) 
Where a lessor is proceeding by action or otherwise to enforce such a right of re-entry 
or forfeiture the lessee may, in the lessor's action (if any), or in any action brought by 
himself, apply to the Supreme Court or a judge thereof for relief, and the court or 
judge may grant or refuse relief as such court or judge, having regard to the 
proceedings and conduct of the parties under the last preceding section and to all other 
circumstances, may think fit. 
 
(2) 
If the court or judge grants relief it or he may grant it on such terms (if any) as to 
costs, expenses, damages, compensation, penalty, or otherwise, including the granting 
of an injunction to restrain any like breach in the future, as the court or judge in the 
circumstances of each case thinks fit. 
12—Interpretation and application of preceding sections 
 
(1) 
For the purposes of the two preceding sections a lease includes an original lease or a 
derivative under-lease, or a grant securing a rent by condition, and a lessee includes an 
original lessee or derivative under-lessee, and the heirs, executors, administrators, and 
assigns of a lessee, also a grantee under such a grant as aforesaid, his heirs and 
assigns; and a lessor includes an original lessor or derivative under-lessor, and his 
heirs, executors, administrators, and assigns, also a grantor as aforesaid, and his heirs 
and assigns. 
 
(2) 
The said sections shall apply, although the provision or stipulation under which the 
right of re-entry or forfeiture accrues is inserted in the lease in pursuance of any Act. 
 
(3) 
For the purposes of the said sections a lease limited to continue as long only as the 
lessee abstains from committing a breach of covenant shall be and take effect as a 
lease to continue for any longer term for which it could subsist, but determinable by a 
proviso for re-entry on such a breach. 
 
(4) 
The said sections shall extend to a covenant or condition against assigning, 
under-letting, parting with the possession, or disposing of the land leased, when the 
consent of the lessor has been vexatiously or capriciously withheld. 
 
(5) 
The said sections shall not apply to Crown leases nor affect the law relating to re-entry 
and forfeiture for non-payment of rent. 
 
(6) 
The said sections shall apply to leases made either before or after the commencement 
of this Act, and shall have effect notwithstanding any stipulation to the contrary.

tenant had at the time of the service of the said declaration and inventory no right of 
property or beneficial interest in such agisted cattle other than his lien for agistment, if 
any, or in such goods, be deemed guilty of an irregular distress, and shall be liable to 
an action on the application of such under-tenant or lodger, but shall not be deemed 
trespassers ab initio.

Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002 
22—Rights of owners of goods in other cases 
If, in any case not coming within section 19 of this Act, any landlord levies, threatens 
to levy, or authorises to be levied, a distress on any goods being the property or in the 
lawful possession of any person other than the immediate tenant, such person or his 
agent may serve the landlord, or the person authorised by him to levy such distress, 
with a declaration in, or to the effect of, the form in Schedule 4, signed by the first 
mentioned person or his agent, setting forth that the immediate tenant has no right of 
property or beneficial interest in such goods, and that such goods are the property of 
such first mentioned person, or are, or immediately prior to being distrained were, in 
his lawful possession; and to such declaration shall be annexed an inventory, signed 
by the declarant, of the goods referred to in the declaration. 
23—Duty of landlord after service of declaration 
Subject to the provisions hereinafter contained and to the person who claims the goods 
proceeding, as provided in the next section before the sale thereof, and obtaining a 
decision in his favour, if any landlord or any person authorised by a landlord, after 
being served with the declaration and inventory provided for by the last preceding 
section, levies or proceeds with a distress on the goods mentioned in the inventory, 
being the property of the person by whom or on whose behalf the declaration and 
inventory was served, or having been immediately prior to such distress in his lawful 
possession, that landlord, and the person so authorised, if any, shall, if the immediate 
tenant had at the time of such service no right of property or beneficial interest in the 
goods, be deemed guilty of an irregular distress, and be liable to an action therefor, but 
shall not be deemed trespassers ab initio. 
24—Adverse claims 
 
(1) 
When any claim is made by service of a declaration and inventory, by any person 
other than the immediate tenant, to or in respect of any agisted cattle or goods 
distrained, or threatened to be distrained, by any landlord for rent, any justice of the 
peace, upon complaint in writing by either the landlord or the claimant preferred 
before the sale of such goods under the distress (where the cattle or goods have been 
actually distrained) by the person making the claim, may— 
 
(a) 
issue a summons in the form in Schedule 5, or in a form to the like effect, 
directed as well to the landlord as to the person making the claim; and 
 
(b) 
in his discretion order such sale to be postponed until the summons has been 
disposed of. 
 
(2) 
The Magistrates Court, on hearing a claim under subsection (1), may make such 
orders, including orders as to costs, as the Court thinks fit. 
 
(3) 
Service of the summons or order on a person authorised by the landlord to distrain 
shall be deemed service on the landlord, and service of the summons or order on a 
person who has made a claim on behalf of another shall be deemed service on the 
principal.

Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002 
11 
25—Decision of Magistrates Court 
If it appears upon the hearing of the complaint that— 
 
(a) 
the agisted cattle claimed were the property of the person alleged to be the 
owner thereof, or that the goods claimed, or part of them, were the property or 
in the lawful possession of the claimant, being an under-tenant or lodger; and 
 
(b) 
the immediate tenant had no right of property or beneficial interest in such 
cattle, other than his lien for agistment, if any, or in such goods; but 
 
(c) 
the claimant did not, before the complaint was preferred, pay to the landlord, 
or the person authorised by him to distrain, all moneys due by the owner of 
the cattle, or by the under-tenant or lodger to the immediate tenant for 
agistment, rent, or lodging, or so much thereof as was sufficient to discharge 
the claim of such landlord and his lawful charges, 
the Magistrates Court must decide accordingly and the decision will be taken to be in 
favour of the landlord. 
26—Power of landlord to hold goods 
Where any complaint is preferred as in section 24 mentioned, the landlord may, at his 
option, where the agisted cattle or the goods have been distrained before the making of 
the claim, hold the cattle or goods claimed until the claim has been adjudicated upon; 
and the costs of such holding, and of holding possession from the making of the claim 
until the adjudication, or such part thereof as the Magistrates Court thinks fit, will, if 
the Court so orders, be added to the costs of the distress, or paid by the claimant to the 
landlord. 
27—Power of landlord to sell goods if claim in his favour 
The landlord may seize or reseize any agisted cattle or any goods as to which the 
decision is in his favour wherever they may be found, and, if necessary, may, between 
sunrise and sunset only, break into any premises where those cattle or goods may be, 
or may reasonably be supposed to be, and may deal with any such cattle or goods as if 
no such claim had been made, although he may have previously sold other cattle or 
goods distrained at the same time, and no fresh claim has been made by the same 
claimant. 
28—False declarations 
If any person wilfully makes or signs any false declaration or inventory under this Part 
he shall be guilty of an offence, punishable by imprisonment for any term not 
exceeding twelve calendar months. 
29—Person entitled to take declarations

he might have dealt with any other goods distrained for rent, except that corn or hay so 
distrained shall not be removed by the landlord or his agent out of the place where it 
was seized, if such removal would depreciate its value, but shall be kept there (as 
impounded) until it is replevied or sold. 
32—Distress may be secured and sold on premises 
 
(1) 
Any landlord or his agent may impound or otherwise secure goods distrained for rent,

possession. 
33—Disposal of proceeds of sale

goods for rent, it shall be lawful for the landlord or his agent, within the space of thirty 
days next after the removal of those goods, to take and seize them wherever they are 
found as a distress for the said rent, and to sell and dispose of them in like manner as 
if they had actually been distrained by the landlord in and upon such premises for such 
rent; but no landlord shall seize or take any such goods which, before such seizure, 
have been sold bona fide and for a valuable consideration to any person not privy to 
the fraud or clandestine removal.
