A  right  of  re-entry  or  forfeiture  under  any  proviso  or
stipulation in a lease for a breach of any covenant or condition

specifying the particular breach complained of; and

and the lessee fails, within a reasonable time thereafter, to

reasonable compensation in money, to the satisfaction of the
lessor, for the breach.
(2)
Where  a  lessor  is  proceeding,  by  action  or  otherwise,  to
enforce such a right of re-entry or forfeiture, the lessee may, in

apply to the court for relief; and the court may grant or refuse
relief, as  the court, having regard  to the proceedings  and

under the provisions of this section.
(4)
Where a lessor is proceeding by action or otherwise to enforce
a right of re-entry or forfeiture under any covenant, proviso, or
stipulation in a lease, or for non-payment of rent, the court
may, on application by any person claiming as under-lessee
any estate or interest in the property comprised in the lease or
any part thereof, either in the lessor‚Äôs action (if any) or in any
action brought by such person for that purpose, make an order
vesting, for the whole term of the lease or any less term, the
property comprised in the lease or any part thereof in any
person entitled as under-lessee to any estate or interest in such
property upon such conditions as to execution of any deed or
other document, payment of rent, costs, expenses, damages,
compensation, giving security, or otherwise, as the court in the

longer term for which it could subsist, but determinable by a
proviso for re-entry on such a breach.
