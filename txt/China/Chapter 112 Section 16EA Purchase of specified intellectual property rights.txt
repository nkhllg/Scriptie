Commissioner is of the opinion that the consideration for the
purchase or sale of any specified intellectual property right

the amount so determined is to be treated‚Äî

for the purposes of subsection (2), as the specified capital
expenditure; and

expenditure incurred for the purposes of a trade, profession or
business by a person about to carry on the trade, profession or
business is to be treated as if it had been incurred by that
person on the first day on which the person carries on the
trade, profession or business.
