on March 11, 2018 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
Preamble 
China is one of the countries with the longest histories in the world. 
The Chinese people of all ethnic groups jointly created its magnificent 
culture and have a proud revolutionary tradition. 
After 1840, feudal China gradually became a semi-colonial, semi-
feudal country. The Chinese people, wave upon wave, waged heroic 
struggles for national independence and liberation and for democracy 
and freedom. 
In the 20th century, momentous historical changes took place in 
China. 
The Revolution of 1911, led by Dr. Sun Yat-sen, abolished the feudal 
monarchy and gave birth to the Republic of China. However, the historic 
mission of the Chinese people to oppose imperialism and feudalism was 
not yet accomplished. 
In 1949, after engaging in protracted, arduous and tortuous struggles, 
armed and in other forms, the Chinese people of all ethnic groups led by 
the Communist Party of China with Chairman Mao Zedong as its leader 
finally overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism and bureaucrat-
capitalism, won a great victory in the New Democratic Revolution, and 
founded the People’s Republic of China. The Chinese people thus secured 
power and became masters of their own country. 
After the founding of the People’s Republic of China, our country 
gradually achieved the transition from a new democratic society to a 
socialist society. The socialist transformation of private ownership of the 
means of production has been completed, the system of exploitation of 
man by man abolished, and a socialist system established. The people’s 
democratic dictatorship led by the working class and based on an 
alliance of workers and peasants, which in essence is a dictatorship of the 
proletariat, has been consolidated and developed. The Chinese people 
and the Chinese People’s Liberation Army have defeated imperialist and 
hegemonist aggression, sabotage and armed provocations, safeguarded 
national independence and security, and strengthened national defense. 
3 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Major achievements have been made in economic development. An 
independent and relatively complete socialist industrial system has 
now basically been established, and agricultural output has markedly 
increased. Significant advances have been made in education, science, 
culture and other fields, and education about socialist thought has 
made notable progress. The lives of the people have been considerably 
improved. 
Both the victory in China’s New Democratic Revolution and the 
successes in its socialist cause have been achieved by the Chinese people 
of all ethnic groups under the leadership of the Communist Party of 
China and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought 
by upholding truth, correcting errors, and surmounting many difficulties 
and obstacles. Our country will long remain in the primary stage of 
socialism. The fundamental task for our country is to concentrate on 
achieving socialist modernization along the road of socialism with 
Chinese characteristics. We the Chinese people of all ethnic groups 
will continue, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China 
and the guidance of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, Deng 
Xiaoping Theory, the Theory of Three Represents, the Scientific Outlook 
on Development and Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese 
Characteristics for a New Era, to uphold the people’s democratic 
dictatorship, stay on the socialist road, carry out reform and opening up, 
steadily improve the socialist institutions, develop the socialist market 
economy and socialist democracy, improve socialist rule of law, apply the 
new development philosophy, and work hard in a spirit of self-reliance 
to modernize step by step the country’s industry, agriculture, national 
defense, and science and technology and promote coordinated material, 
political, cultural-ethical, social and ecological advancement, in order 
to build China into a great modern socialist country that is prosperous, 
strong, democratic, culturally advanced, harmonious and beautiful, and 
realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. 
In our country the exploiting class, as a class, has been eliminated, 
but class struggle will continue to exist within a certain scope for a long 
time to come. The people of China must fight against those domestic 
and foreign forces and elements that are hostile to and undermine our 
country’s socialist system.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Taiwan is part of the sacred territory of the People’s Republic of 
China. It is the sacred duty of all the Chinese people, including our fellow 
Chinese in Taiwan, to achieve the great reunification of the motherland. 
The cause of building socialism must rely on workers, peasants 
and intellectuals and unite all forces that can be united. Through the 
long process of revolution, development and reform, a broad patriotic 
united front has formed under the leadership of the Communist Party 
of China, with the participation of other political parties and people’s 
organizations and including all socialist working people, people involved 
in building socialism, patriots who support socialism, and patriots who 
support China’s reunification and are dedicated to the rejuvenation of 
the Chinese nation. This united front will continue to be consolidated 
and developed. The Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference 
is a broadly representative organization of the united front, and has 
played a significant historical role. In the future, it will play an even more 
important role in the country’s political and social life and its friendly 
foreign activities, in socialist modernization and in safeguarding the unity 
and solidarity of the country. The system of multiparty cooperation and 
political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party of 
China will continue and develop long into the future. 
The People’s Republic of China is a unified multiethnic state founded 
by the Chinese people of all ethnic groups. Socialist ethnic relations of 
equality, unity, mutual assistance and harmony are established and will 
continue to be strengthened. In the struggle to safeguard ethnic unity, 
we should oppose major ethnic group chauvinism, which mainly refers 
to Han chauvinism, and local ethnic chauvinism. The state makes every 
effort to promote the shared prosperity of all the country’s ethnic groups. 
The achievements of China’s revolution, development and reform 
would have been impossible without the support of the world’s people. 
The future of China is closely bound up with the future of the world. 
China pursues an independent foreign policy, observes the five principles 
of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity, mutual 
nonaggression, mutual noninterference in internal affairs, equality and 
mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence, keeps to a path of peaceful 
development, follows a mutually beneficial strategy of opening up, works 
5 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
to develop diplomatic relations and economic and cultural exchanges with 
other countries, and promotes the building of a human community with a 
shared future. China consistently opposes imperialism, hegemonism and 
colonialism, works to strengthen its solidarity with the people of all other 
countries, supports oppressed peoples and other developing countries in 
their just struggles to win and safeguard their independence and develop 
their economies, and strives to safeguard world peace and promote the 
cause of human progress. 
This Constitution affirms, in legal form, the achievements of the 
struggles of the Chinese people of all ethnic groups and stipulates 
the fundamental system and task of the state. It is the fundamental 
law of the state and has supreme legal force. The people of all ethnic 
groups, all state organs and armed forces, all political parties and social 
organizations, and all enterprises and public institutions in the country 
must treat the Constitution as the fundamental standard of conduct; 
they have a duty to uphold the sanctity of the Constitution and ensure its 
compliance.

The organs through which the people exercise state power are the

No organization or individual shall have any privilege beyond the 
Constitution or the law. 
Article 6 
The foundation of the socialist economic system of the People’s 
Republic of China is socialist public ownership of the means of 
production, that is, ownership by the whole people and collective 
ownership by the working people. The system of socialist public 
ownership has eradicated the system of exploitation of man by man, and 
practices the principle of “from each according to his ability, to each 
according to his work.” 
In the primary stage of socialism, the state shall uphold a 
fundamental economic system under which public ownership is the 
mainstay and diverse forms of ownership develop together, and shall 
uphold an income distribution system under which distribution according 
to work is the mainstay, while multiple forms of distribution exist 
alongside it. 
Article 7 
The state sector of the economy, that is, the sector of the socialist 
economy under ownership by the whole people, shall be the leading force 
in the economy. The state shall ensure the consolidation and development 
of the state sector of the economy. 
Article 8 
Rural collective economic organizations shall practice a two-tiered 
system of both unified and separate operations with household contract 
management as its basis. Rural economic cooperatives — producer, 
supply and marketing, credit and consumer cooperatives — are part of 
the socialist economy under collective ownership by the working people. 
Working people who belong to rural collective economic organizations 
shall have the right, within the scope prescribed by law, to farm cropland 
and hillsides allotted to them for their private use, engage in household

Preamble 
Hong Kong has been part of the territory of China since ancient 
times; it was occupied by Britain after the Opium War in 1840. On 19 
December 1984, the Chinese and British Governments signed the Joint 
Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong, affirming that the 
Government of the People’s Republic of China will resume the exercise 
of sovereignty over Hong Kong with effect from 1 July 1997, thus 
fulfilling the long-cherished common aspiration of the Chinese people for 
the recovery of Hong Kong. 
Upholding national unity and territorial integrity, maintaining the 
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong, and taking account of its history 
and realities, the People’s Republic of China has decided that upon 
China’s resumption of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, a 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will be established in 
accordance with the provisions of Article 31 of the Constitution of 
the People’s Republic of China, and that under the principle of “one 
country, two systems”, the socialist system and policies will not be 
practised in Hong Kong. The basic policies of the People’s Republic of 
China regarding Hong Kong have been elaborated by the Chinese 
Government in the Sino-British Joint Declaration. 
In accordance with the Constitution of the People’s Republic of 
China, the National People’s Congress hereby enacts the Basic Law of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic 
of China, prescribing the systems to be practised in the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region, in order to ensure the implementation of 
the basic policies of the People’s Republic of China regarding Hong 
Kong.

* Explanations on “The Basic Law of the Hong Kong

(Addressing the Third Session of the Seventh National 
People’s Congress on 28 March 1990) 
Ji Pengfei 
Chairman of the Drafting Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China 
Fellow Deputies, 
Through four years and eight months of effort, the Drafting 
Committee for The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region of the People’s Republic of China has completed the work of 
drafting the Basic Law. The Standing Committee of the National People’s 
Congress has submitted to the current session of the National People’s 
Congress for examination “The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (Draft)” and 
three annexes; the draft designs of the regional flag and regional emblem 
for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region: “The Decision of 
the National People’s Congress of the People’s Republic of China on 
the Method for the Formation of the First Government and the First 
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
(Draft),” which has been worked out by the Drafting Committee on 
behalf of the National People’s Congress; and “The Proposal by the 
Drafting Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region on the Establishment of the Committee for the 
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region under the 
Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress.” I have been 
entrusted by the Drafting Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region to make the following explanations 
concerning this legal document. 
In accordance with “The Decision of the Third Session of the 
Sixth National People’s Congress on the Establishment of the Drafting 
128 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region of the People’s Republic of China,” at its 11th session the 
Standing Committee of the Sixth National People’s Congress appointed 
the members of the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee. On 
1 July 1985, the Drafting Committee was officially established and 
began its work. After mapping out its work plans and deciding upon the 
structure of the Basic Law, the Drafting Committee set up five special 
groups consisting of committee members from both the mainland and 
Hong Kong. The five groups, namely, the Special Group Concerned 
with the Relationship between the Central Authorities and the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region; the Special Group Concerned 
with Fundamental Rights and Duties of Residents; the Special Group 
Concerned with the Political Structure; the Special Group Concerned 
with the Economy; and the Special Group Concerned with Education, 
Science, Technology, Culture, Sports and Religion, were responsible 
for the drafting work. After these special groups worked out their first 
draft of provisions of the Basic Law, the General Working Group was 
set up to make overall adjustment and revision of the draft provisions. 
In April 1988, the seventh plenary session of the Hong Kong Basic Law 
Drafting Committee issued “The Draft Basic Law of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China for 
Solicitation of Opinions.” In the next five months, the Committee widely 
collected opinions from Hong Kong and the provinces, autonomous 
regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government and 
relevant departments on the mainland and, based on the collected 
opinions, the Committee made more than 100 revisions in the draft 
version. In January 1989, at its eighth plenary session, the Drafting 
Committee voted by secret ballot on the draft Hong Kong Basic Law 
and its annexes and related documents to be submitted to the Standing 
Committee of the National People’s Congress, article by article and 
document by document. Except for Article 19 in the draft Basic Law, 
all other provisions, annexes and related documents were adopted by 
a two-thirds majority. At its sixth session held in February 1989, the 
Standing Committee of the Seventh National People’s Congress decided 
to promulgate the Hong Kong Basic Law (Draft), its annexes and other 
related documents to widely solicit opinions from Hong Kong; from the 
provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the 
Central Government on the mainland; and from central government 
129 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
departments, democratic parties, mass organizations and experts as well 
as from the general departments of the People’s Liberation Army. After 
an eight-month opinion-soliciting period followed by a careful study 
of the opinions collected from all circles, the special groups jointly put 
forward 24 amendment bills, including the one regarding Article 19 in 
the Hong Kong Basic Law (Draft). At the ninth plenary session of the 
Drafting Committee in February this year, those amendment bills were 
voted upon by secret ballot one by one and all of them were passed by 
an over two-thirds majority. Then, all relevant provisions in the original 
draft were replaced by provisions recommended by the amendment bills. 
With this, the work of drawing up the Hong Kong Basic Law (Draft), its 
annexes and other related documents was complete. 
The collection and selection of designs for the regional flag and 
regional emblem of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
was the responsibility of the Committee for Selecting Designs for 
the Regional Flag and Regional Emblem of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region, consisting of five drafters of the Basic Law and 
six experts from both Hong Kong and the mainland. After the selecting 
committee conducted the first and second rounds of selection from the 
7,147 contributed designs, the Basic Law Drafting Committee examined 
and appraised the candidates recommended by the selecting committee. 
Since the Drafting Committee failed to decide upon a single set of 
designs for the regional flag and regional emblem to be submitted to the 
National People’s Congress for examination, the selecting committee 
again worked out three sets of candidate designs of the regional flag 
and regional emblem for the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
through collective modification of certain contributed designs. The draft 
designs of the regional flag and regional emblem to be submitted to the 
National People’s Congress for examination were finally selected at the 
ninth plenary session of the Basic Law Drafting Committee through a 
secret ballot. Also at the session, the second and third paragraphs under 
Article 10 of the draft Basic Law regarding the regional flag and regional 
emblem of the Special Administrative Region were passed. 
Over this period of more than four years, the Drafting Committee 
has held nine plenary sessions, 25 meetings of the Chairman and Vice-
Chairmen and two enlarged meetings of the Chairman and Vice­
130 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Chairmen; the General Working Group held three meetings; the Special 
Groups met 73 times; and even the Committee for Selecting Designs 
for the Regional Flag and Regional Emblem of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region held five meetings. 
In reviewing the work done over this period of more than four 
years, we must say that drafting of this legal document was conducted 
in a very democratic and open manner. During the process of drafting 
the Basic Law, members of the Drafting Committee worked together 
with one heart and pooled their wisdom and efforts; and each and every 
article of the document was worked out after investigation, study and 
full discussion in which views of the majority were followed and those of 
the minority respected. After every meeting, reporters covering the event 
were briefed and the Consultative Committee for the Basic Law of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region was immediately informed of 
its proceedings. The work of drafting the Basic Law was completed with 
the close attention and broad participation of the entire nation, especially 
the compatriots and people from all circles in Hong Kong. What is 
especially noteworthy here is that the Hong Kong Basic Law Consultative 
Committee, formed by people from all walks of life in Hong Kong, 
collected a great amount of opinions and suggestions in Hong Kong on 
the Basic Law and promptly referred them to the Drafting Committee 
and has rendered active and effective assistance to the work of drafting 
the Basic Law from the very beginning. The work of the Consultative 
Committee has been praised by the drafters. 
Fellow Deputies, 
The draft Basic Law that has been submitted to the current session 
of the National People’s Congress for examination includes a Preamble 
and 160 articles in nine chapters. The nine chapters are: Chapter I, 
General Principles; Chapter II, Relationship Between the Central 
Authorities and the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region; Chapter 
III, Fundamental Rights and Duties of the Residents; Chapter IV, 
Political Structure; Chapter V, Economy; Chapter VI, Education, Science, 
Culture, Sports, Religion, Labour and Social Services; Chapter VII, 
External Affairs; Chapter VIII, Interpretation and Amendment of the 
Basic Law; and Chapter IX, Supplementary Provisions. There are also 
131 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
three annexes, namely, Annex I: Method for the Selection of the Chief 
Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region; Annex II: 
Method for the Formation of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region and Its Voting Procedures; and Annex III: 
National Laws to be Applied in the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region. 
I. On the Guiding Principle of Drafting the Hong Kong Basic Law 
“One country, two systems” is the fundamental policy of the Chinese 
Government for bringing about the country’s reunification. In line with 
this policy, the Chinese Government has formulated a series of principles 
and policies regarding Hong Kong. The main point is to establish 
a special administrative region directly under the Central People’s 
Government when China resumes its sovereignty over Hong Kong. Except 
for national defence and foreign affairs, which are to be administered 
by the Central Government, the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region will exercise a high degree of autonomy; no socialist system or 
policies will be practiced in the Region, the original capitalist society, 
economic system and way of life will remain unchanged and the laws 
previously in force in Hong Kong will remain basically the same; Hong 
Kong’s status as an international financial centre and free port will be 
maintained; and the economic interests of Britain and other countries in 
Hong Kong will be taken into consideration. The Chinese Government 
has written the above principles and policies into the Sino-British Joint 
Declaration on the Question of Hong Kong and proclaimed that all the 
principles and policies regarding Hong Kong will remain unchanged for 
50 years, which is to be codified in the Basic Law. The concept of “one 
country, two systems” and all the principles and policies regarding Hong 
Kong formulated on the basis of this concept provide the fundamental 
guarantee for the resumption of China’s sovereignty over Hong Kong 
and the maintenance of Hong Kong’s stability and prosperity; they also 
conform to the basic interests of the Chinese people, particularly those of 
the Hong Kong compatriots. 
Article 31 of China’s Constitution stipulates that “the state may 
establish special administrative regions when necessary. The systems to 
be instituted in special administrative regions shall be prescribed by law 
132 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
 
enacted by the National People’s Congress in the light of the specific 
conditions.” China is a socialist country and socialism is China’s basic 
system. To realize China’s reunification, however, another kind of social 
system, namely, the capitalist system, may be practiced in individual 
regions of the country. It is on the basis of China’s Constitution and with 
“one country, two systems” as the guiding principle that all the state 
principles and policies regarding Hong Kong have been established in the 
draft Hong Kong Basic Law, which has been submitted to the present 
session of the National People’s Congress for examination. 
II. On the relationship between the Central Authorities and the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region 
The relationship between the Central Authorities and the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region is one of the important issues defined by 
the Basic Law and is touched upon not only in Chapter II but also in 
Chapter I, Chapter VII, Chapter VIII and other chapters. 
Article 12 of the draft stipulates, “The Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region shall be a local administrative region of 
the People’s Republic of China, which shall enjoy a high degree of 
autonomy and come directly under the Central People’s Government.” 
This stipulation defines the legal status of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region and constitutes the basis for specifying the 
Region’s limits of power and its relationship with the Central Authorities. 
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, as an inalienable part 
of the People’s Republic of China, will be a local administrative region 
directly under the Central People’s Government and at the same time, 
it will be a special administrative region enjoying a high degree of 
autonomy and practicing a system and executing policies different from 
those of the mainland. Therefore, the draft Basic Law contains both 
provisions embodying the unity and sovereignty of the country and 
provisions empowering the Special Administrative Region with a high 
degree of autonomy in the light of Hong Kong’s special circumstances. 
The power to be exercised by, or the affairs which are the 
responsibility of the Standing Committee of the National People’s 
Congress or the Central People’s Government, as prescribed in the draft 
133 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
law, is indispensable to maintaining the state sovereignty. For example, 
the Central People’s Government will be responsible for the Special 
Administrative Region’s defence and foreign affairs and the Chief 
Executive and other principal officials of the Special Administrative 
Region will be appointed by the Central People’s Government; a small 
number of national laws relating to defence and foreign affairs as well 
as other matters beyond the limits of the autonomy of the Special 
Administrative Region will be applied locally by way of promulgation or 
legislation by the Special Administrative Region; and in the event that 
the National People’s Congress Standing Committee decides to declare 
a state of war or, by reason of turmoil within the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region which endangers national unity or security and is 
beyond the control of the Special Administrative Region Government, 
decides that the Region is in a state of emergency, the Central People’s 
Government may issue an order applying the relevant national laws in 
Hong Kong. The draft law also stipulates that the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region shall enact laws on its own to prohibit any 
act of treason, secession, sedition, or subversion against the Central 
People’s Government, or theft of state secret, to prohibit foreign political 
organizations or bodies from conducting political activities in the Region, 
and to prohibit political organizations or bodies of the Region from 
establishing ties with foreign political organizations or bodies. These 
stipulations are entirely necessary for maintaining the state sovereignty, 
unity and territorial integrity as well as for preserving Hong Kong’s long­
term stability and prosperity. 
The high degree of autonomy to be enjoyed by the Special 
Administrative Region, as stipulated in the draft, embodies executive, 
legislative and independent judicial power, including that of final 
adjudication. The Special Administrative Region, authorized by the 
Central People’s Government, also has the power to conduct relevant 
external affairs on its own. This shows that the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region will enjoy extensive autonomy. 
Regarding the executive power, the draft law, while stipulating 
that the Special Administrative Region shall, on its own, conduct the 
administrative affairs of Hong Kong in accordance with the Basic Law, 
specifically defines the Special Administrative Region’s autonomy in 
134 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
areas such as finance, economy, industry and commerce, trade, transport 
and communications, development and management of land and 
natural resources, education, science and technology, culture, sports, 
public order and control of entry and exit activities. For instance, the 
draft law stipulates that the Special Administrative Region shall have 
independent finances, its revenues shall not be handed over to the Central 
Government, and the Central Government shall not levy taxes in the 
Region; and the Special Administrative Region may, on its own, formulate 
monetary and financial policies, the Hong Kong dollar shall be the legal 
tender in the Region, and the authority to issue Hong Kong currency 
shall be vested in the Special Administrative Region Government. Also, 
the draft stipulates that representatives of the Special Administrative 
Region Government may act as members of delegations of the Chinese 
Government to participate in negotiations at the diplomatic level 
affecting Hong Kong; the Special Administrative Region may on its own, 
using the name “Hong Kong, China,” maintain and develop relations 
and conclude and implement agreements with foreign states and regions 
and relevant international organizations in economic, trade, financial and 
monetary, shipping, communications, tourism, cultural, sports and other 
appropriate fields. 
Regarding the legislative power, the draft stipulates that laws enacted 
by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region legislature shall take 
effect upon the signature and promulgation by the Chief Executive. 
The laws shall be reported to the National People’s Congress Standing 
Committee for the record, but they will go into force without being 
affected by this reporting. The draft also stipulates that only when it 
considers that any law enacted by the Special Administrative Region 
legislature is not in conformity with the provisions of the Basic Law 
regarding affairs within the responsibility of the Central Authorities 
or regarding the relationship between the Central Authorities and the 
Region, shall the National People’s Congress Standing Committee return 
the law in question; the Standing Committee shall not amend it. Any law 
returned by the National People’s Congress Standing Committee shall 
immediately be invalidated. These stipulations not only conform with the 
“one country, two systems” principle and are in line with provisions of 
the Constitution, but also take into full consideration the need for Hong 
Kong to enjoy a high degree of autonomy. 
135 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
According to the Constitution, interpretation of laws is among 
the powers and functions of the National People’s Congress Standing 
Committee. To take into account Hong Kong’s special circumstances, 
the draft Basic Law, while stipulating that the power of interpretation of 
the Basic Law shall be vested in the National People’s Congress Standing 
Committee, provides that the National People’s Congress Standing 
Committee shall authorizes the courts of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region to interpret on their own, in adjudicating cases, the 
provisions of the Basic Law which are within the limits of the autonomy 
of the Region. This stipulation will guarantee the power of the National 
People’s Congress Standing Committee and also facilitate the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region in exercising its autonomy. According 
to the draft, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region courts 
may also interpret other provisions of the Basic Law in adjudicating 
cases. However, if the courts, in adjudicating cases, need to interpret the 
provisions of the Basic Law concerning affairs which are the responsibility 
of the Central People’s Government, or the relationship between the 
Central Authorities and the Region, and if such interpretation will affect 
their final judgements on the cases, the courts shall seek an interpretation 
of the relevant provisions from the National People’s Congress Standing 
Committee through the Court of Final Appeal of the Region. The 
courts, in applying those provisions, shall follow the interpretation of 
the National People’s Congress Standing Committee. This stipulation 
will provide the basis for the Region’s courts, in adjudicating cases, to 
comprehend the provisions of the Basic Law concerning affairs which are 
the responsibility of the Central Government or the relationship between 
the Central Authorities and the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region, and prevent the courts from making erroneous judgements due 
to inaccurate understanding. 
The draft vests the courts of the Special Administrative Region with 
independent judicial power, including that of final adjudication. This is 
certainly a very special situation wherein courts in a local administrative 
region enjoy the power of final adjudication. Nevertheless, in view of the 
fact that Hong Kong will practise social and legal systems different from 
the mainland’s, this provision is necessary. Under the current judicial 
system and principles, the Hong Kong authorities have never exercised 
jurisdiction over acts of state such as defence and foreign affairs. While 
136 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
preserving the above principle, the draft stipulates that the courts of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall obtain a certificate 
from the Chief Executive on questions of fact concerning acts of state 
such as defence and foreign affairs wherever such questions arise in the 
adjudication of cases. This certificate shall be binding on the courts. 
However, before issuing such a certificate, the Chief Executive shall 
obtain a certifying document from the Central People’s Government. 
This stipulation not only appropriately solves the question of jurisdiction 
over acts of state, but also guarantees that the courts of the Region can 
conduct their functions in a normal way. 
In addition, in order to enable the National People’s Congress 
Standing Committee to heed fully the opinions of the people from all 
walks of life in Hong Kong when it makes decisions on whether a law 
enacted by the Special Administrative Region legislature conforms to 
the provisions concerning affairs within the responsibility of the Central 
Authorities or to the provisions concerning the relationship between the 
Central Authorities and the Special Administrative Region, decisions on 
adding to or deleting from the list of national laws which are applicable 
in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in Annex III and 
decisions on the interpretation of and amendment to the Basic Law, the 
drafters have recommended that when the Basic Law comes into force, 
a working committee be set up under the National People’s Congress 
Standing Committee to submit its views regarding the above questions 
to the National People’s Congress Standing Committee. The working 
committee shall be composed of people from the mainland and Hong 
Kong. To this end, the Hong Kong Basic Law Drafting Committee has 
drafted the “Proposal by the Drafting Committee for the Basic Law of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on the Establishment 
of the Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region under the Standing Committee of the National 
People’s Congress.” 
III. On the Fundamental Rights and Duties of Hong Kong Residents 
The extensive rights and freedoms enjoyed by the residents of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and other people residing in 
the Region as prescribed in Chapter III of the draft Basic Law include 
137 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
political, economic, cultural, social and family rights and freedoms and 
the freedom of person. The special features in the provisions concerning 
Hong Kong residents’ rights and freedoms in the draft Basic Law boil 
down to the following two basic points: 
(1) The draft provides multi-level protection for Hong Kong 
residents’ rights and freedoms. In accordance with the characteristics of 
the composition of Hong Kong residents, the draft stipulates not only the 
general rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong residents, but also 
the rights of the permanent residents and Chinese citizens living among 
them. It also stipulates that people other than Hong Kong residents also 
enjoy the rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents in accordance with 
the law. In addition, while stipulating in explicit terms the fundamental 
rights and freedoms of Hong Kong residents, the draft also stipulates 
that Hong Kong residents shall enjoy the other rights and freedoms 
safeguarded by the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region. In view of the application in Hong Kong of the International 
Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the International Covenant 
on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, and international labour 
conventions, the draft stipulates that those provisions shall remain in 
force and be implemented through the laws of the Special Administrative 
Region. In addition to a chapter specially devoted to Hong Kong 
residents’ rights and freedoms, there are also provisions concerning 
the issue in other relevant chapters and articles. Thus, extensive, 
comprehensive and multi-level protection is provided for safeguarding 
Hong Kong residents’ rights and freedoms. 
(2) The rights, freedoms and duties of Hong Kong residents are 
prescribed in the draft in accordance with the principle of “one country, 
two systems” and in the light of Hong Kong’s actual situation. They 
include such specific provisions as protection of private ownership 
of property, the freedom of movement and freedom to enter or leave 
the Region, the right to raise a family freely and protection of private 
persons’ and legal entities’ property. The draft also provides that the 
systems to safeguard the fundamental rights and freedoms of Hong Kong 
residents shall all be based on the Basic Law. 
138 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
IV. On the Political Structure 
Chapter IV of the draft Basic Law mainly defines the formation 
and powers of and inter-relationship among the executive, legislature 
and judiciary, as well as the qualifications, powers and functions of 
and relevant policies regarding the Chief Executive, principal officials, 
members of the executive and legislative councils, judges of the courts at 
all levels and other members of the judiciary, and public servants of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. It also provides that district 
organizations which are not organs of political power may be established 
in the Region. 
The political structure of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region should accord with the principle of “one country, two systems” 
and aim to maintain stability and prosperity in Hong Kong in line with 
its legal status and actual situation. To this end, consideration must be 
given to the interests of the different sectors of society and the structure 
must facilitate the development of the capitalist economy in the Region. 
While the part of the existing political structure proven to be effective will 
be maintained, a democratic system that suits Hong Kong’s reality should 
gradually be introduced. In accordance with this principle, Chapter 
IV and Annexes I and II of the Basic Law contain the following major 
provisions concerning the political structure of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region: 
(1) The relationship between the executive authorities and the 
legislature. The executive authorities and the legislature should regulate 
each other as well as co-ordinate their activities. To maintain Hong 
Kong’s stability and administrative efficiency, the Chief Executive must 
have real power which, at the same time, should be subject to some 
restrictions. The draft provides for the Chief Executive to be the head of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and accountable to the 
Central People’s Government and the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region. He or she is to lead the government of the Region, sign bills 
and budgets and promulgate laws. If the Chief Executive considers a bill 
passed by the Legislative Council to be not compatible with the overall 
interests of the Region, he or she may return it to the Legislative Council 
for reconsideration. If the Chief Executive refuses to sign a bill passed 
139 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
the second time by the Legislative Council, or the Legislative Council 
refuses to pass a budget or any other important bill introduced by the 
government, and if consensus still cannot be reached after consultations, 
the Chief Executive may dissolve the Legislative Council. On the other 
hand, the Basic Law provides that the government of the Region must 
abide by the law and be accountable to the Legislative Council. It must 
implement laws passed by the Legislative Council and already in force, 
present regular policy addresses to the Council, answer questions raised 
by members of the Council and obtain approval from the Council for 
taxation and public expenditure. The Chief Executive must consult the 
Executive Council before making important policy decisions, introducing 
bills to the Legislative Council, enacting subordinate legislation, or 
dissolving the Legislative Council. The Basic Law also stipulates that if 
the bill returned by the Chief Executive is passed again by the Legislative 
Council with at least a two-thirds majority, the Chief Executive must 
sign and promulgate it within one month, unless he or she dissolves the 
Legislative Council. If the newly elected Legislative Council, after the 
old one has been dissolved, again passes by a two-thirds majority the 
original bill in dispute, or it still refuses to pass the original budget or any 
other important bill introduced by the government, the Chief Executive 
must resign. If the Chief Executive is found to have committed a serious 
breach of law or dereliction of duty and if he or she still refuses to resign, 
the Legislative Council may pass a motion of impeachment through the 
specified procedures and refer it to the Central People’s Government for 
decision. The provisions mentioned above embody the relationship of 
regulation and co-ordination between the executive authorities and the 
legislature. 
(2) The method for the selection of the Chief Executive. The draft 
stipulates that the Chief Executive shall be selected by election or through 
consultations and be appointed by the Central People’s Government. 
The method for selecting the Chief Executive shall be worked out in the 
light of the actual situation in Hong Kong and applied in a gradual and 
orderly way. The ultimate goal is the selection of the Chief Executive 
by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative 
nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures. 
Based on these provisions, Annex I provides specific rules on selecting 
the Chief Executive. In the ten years between 1997 and 2007, the Chief 
140 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
Executive will be elected by a broadly representative election committee. 
If there is need to amend this method of election after that period, 
such amendments must be made with the endorsement of a two-thirds 
majority of all the members of the Legislative Council and the consent 
of the Chief Executive, and they must be submitted to the Standing 
Committee of the National People’s Congress for approval. The method 
for selecting the Chief Executive is provided in an annex to make it more 
amenable to revision when necessary. 
(3) The method for forming the Legislative Council and its 
procedures for voting on bills and motions. According to the draft Basic 
Law, the Legislative Council will be constituted by election. The method 
for forming the Legislative Council will be worked out in the light of the 
actual situation in Hong Kong and applied in a gradual and orderly way. 
The ultimate goal is the election of all the members of the Legislative 
Council by universal suffrage. In accordance with these provisions, Annex 
II provides specific rules on formation of the Legislative Council. The 
first and second Legislative Council will be formed by members elected by 
functional constituencies, by the Election Committee or by geographical 
constituencies through direct elections. During the first 10 years after the 
Special Administrative Region is established, the number of seats in the 
Legislative Council for members elected by geographical constituencies 
through direct elections will be increased with each passing council, and 
the number of seats elected by the Election Committee will be gradually 
reduced. When the third Legislative Council is formed, members elected 
by functional constituencies and geographical constituencies through 
direct elections will each share half the seats of the Legislative Council. 
These rules accord with the principle of developing the election system 
in a gradual and orderly way. Annex II also stipulates that different 
voting procedures shall be adopted by the Legislative Council in handling 
bills introduced by the government and motions and bills introduced 
by individual members of the Legislative Council. The passage of bills 
introduced by the government requires a simple majority vote of the 
members of the Legislative Council present. The passage of motions, bills 
or amendments to government bills introduced by individual members of 
the Legislative Council requires at least a simple majority vote by each of 
the two groups of members present, i.e., members returned by functional 
constituencies and those returned by geographical constituencies through 
141 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
direct elections and by the Election Committee. Such provisions take into 
consideration the interests of all social strata and will prevent endless 
debates over government bills, thus helping the government work with 
efficiency. Ten years after the establishment of the Special Administrative 
Region, if there is a need to improve the method for forming the 
Legislative Council and its procedures for voting on bills and motions, 
such improvements shall be made with the endorsement of a two-thirds 
majority of all the members of the Legislative Council and the consent 
of the Chief Executive, and they must be reported to the Standing 
Committee of the National People’s Congress for the record. The method 
for forming the Legislative Council and the Council’s procedures for 
voting on bills and motions are provided in an annex because it is more 
amenable to revision when necessary. 
(4) Qualifications for the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region, members of the Executive Council, the President 
of the Legislative Council, principal government officials, the chief justice 
of the Court of Final Appeal and the chief judges of the High Court, 
as well as Hong Kong members of the Basic Law Committee. Relevant 
provisions in the draft Basic Law stipulate that these posts must be held 
by Chinese citizens who are permanent residents of the Region with no 
right of abode in any foreign country. This helps define state sovereignty 
and reflects the principle of managing Hong Kong by the Hong Kong 
people. Only in this way can those maintaining the posts mentioned above 
hold themselves responsible to the State, the Region and the residents of 
Hong Kong. Based on the same considerations, relevant articles stipulate 
that the Region’s Legislative Council must be composed of Chinese 
citizens who are permanent residents of the Region with no right of 
abode in any foreign country. However, in view of Hong Kong’s specific 
conditions, permanent residents of the Region who are not of Chinese 
nationality or who have the right of abode in foreign countries may also 
be elected members of the Legislative Council of the Region, provided 
that the proportion of such members does not exceed 20 per cent of the 
total membership of the Council. 
(5) The method for the formation of the first Government and 
the first Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region. In line with the principles of state sovereignty and for the benefit 
142 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
of smooth transition, the establishment of the Special Administrative 
Region will be presided over by a Preparatory Committee set up by the 
National People’s Congress. Since preparations must be made before 
the establishment of the first Government and the first Legislative 
Council and since the Basic Law will not go into effect until 1 July 1997, 
the Drafting Committee has suggested that the National People’s 
Congress make a special decision on the method for the formation of 
the first Government and Legislative Council and that the decision be 
made public together with the Basic Law. The Drafting Committee has 
therefore worked out a draft of the decision on behalf of the National 
People’s Congress. According to this decision, the candidate for the first 
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region will 
be recommended by a selection committee composed entirely of Hong 
Kong residents and then referred to the Central People’s Government 
for appointment. If the composition of the last Hong Kong Legislative 
Council before the establishment of the Special Administrative Region 
is in conformity with the provisions of the decision made by the 
National People’s Congress on the method for the formation of the first 
Government and the first Legislative Council, those of its members who 
uphold the Basic Law and pledge allegiance to the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region and who meet the requirements set forth in the 
Basic Law may, upon confirmation by the Preparatory Committee, 
become members of the first Legislative Council of the Region. This 
arrangement is designed to ensure stability throughout the transition 
period and make the two governments dovetail without a hitch. 
According to the decision, when assuming office, the Chief Executive, 
principal officials, members of the Executive Council and the Legislative 
Council, judges of the courts at all levels and other members of the 
judiciary must swear to uphold the Basic Law and swear allegiance to the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of 
China. 
V. On Economy, Education, Science, Culture, Sports, Religion, 
Labour and Social Services 
Chapter V of the Basic Law contains stipulations on the economic 
system and policies of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, 
143 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
divided into eight fields of endeavour: public finance, monetary affairs, 
trade, industry, commerce, land leases, shipping and civil aviation. These 
stipulations are indispensable to ensuring the normal operation of Hong 
Kong’s capitalist economic mechanism and maintaining its status as an 
international financial centre and free port. Concerning monetary affairs, 
for instance, the draft Basic Law stipulates that no foreign exchange 
control policies shall be applied in the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region and that markets for foreign exchange, gold, securities, futures 
and the like shall continue. The free flow of capital within, into and 
out of Region as well as the free operation of financial businesses and 
financial markets are safeguarded. It also stipulates that the Hong Kong 
dollar is the legal tender in the Region and shall be freely convertible and 
that the authority for its issuance shall be vested in the Government of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. As for foreign trade, the 
draft Basic Law stipulates that all investments from outside the Region 
shall be protected by law, and the free movement of goods, intangible 
assets and capital shall be safeguarded. Unless otherwise prescribed 
by law, no tariff shall be imposed. As a separate customs territory, the 
Region may, using the name “Hong Kong, China,” participate in relevant 
international organizations and trade agreements (including preferential 
trade arrangements), such as the General Agreement on Tariffs and 
Trade and arrangements regarding international trade in textiles. Export 
quotas, tariff preferences and other similar arrangements obtained or 
made by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be enjoyed 
exclusively by the Region. The draft Basic Law also stipulates that the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall strive to achieve a fiscal 
balance and avoid deficits in drawing up its budget. The Region may 
also enact laws on its own concerning the taxation system, using the 
previously pursued low tax policy as reference. The draft Basic Law also 
carries detailed stipulations concerning the major trades, land leases, 
shipping, civil aviation and the like. 
Chapter VI of the draft Basic Law carries stipulations on the 
maintenance and development of Hong Kong’s current systems and 
policies concerning education, science, culture, sports, religion, labour 
and social services. These stipulations involve the interests of Hong Kong 
residents in many aspects of public life and are important for social 
stability and development. 
144 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
  
There are quite a number of articles concerning policies in Chapter V 
and VI of the draft Basic Law. The Chinese Government has undertaken, 
in the Sino-British Joint Declaration, to write its basic principles and 
policies on Hong Kong and their detailed explanations as given in Annex 
I of the Joint Declaration into Basic Law, and Hong Kong residents 
from all walks of life have a strong desire for the Basic Law to reflect 
and protect their interests. Therefore, it was decided in the end that these 
articles concerning policies should remain in the draft Basic Law, despite 
the differing opinions expressed over the brevity of articles during the 
drafting of the law. 
Finally, I should like to explain a few points about the draft designs 
of the regional flag and regional emblem of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region. The regional flag carries a design of five bauhinia 
petals, each with a star in the middle, on a red background. The red flag 
represents the motherland and the bauhinia represents Hong Kong. 
The design implies that Hong Kong is an inalienable part of China and 
prospers in the embrace of the motherland. The five stars on the flower 
symbolize the fact that all Hong Kong compatriots love their motherland, 
while the red and white colours embody the principle of “one country, 
two systems.” The regional emblem is round and bears a design similar 
to the one on the flag, with five red stars on a white bauhinia against a 
red background, which also symbolizes the principle of “one country, 
two systems” by the use of red and white. The outer ring of the emblem 
carries the words “Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the 
People’s Republic of China” in Chinese, and “HONG KONG” in English. 
Fellow Deputies, 
I hereby present my explanations concerning “The Basic Law of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of 
China (Draft),” its annexes and other relevant documents and concerning 
the draft designs of the regional flag and regional emblem of the 
Special Administrative Region, to the National People’s Congress for 
examination.

of the specific conditions.” The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region is constitutional as it is enacted in accordance 
with the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China and in the light 
of the specific conditions of Hong Kong. The systems, policies and 
laws to be instituted after the establishment of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region shall be based on the Basic Law of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region. 
The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of 
the People’s Republic of China shall be put into effect as of July 1, 1997.

Appendix 
Description of the Boundary of the Administrative Division 
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
of the People’s Republic of China 
The boundary comprises a land and sea sector. 
I. The Land Sector 
The land sector comprises three sections as follows: 
(1) Sha Tau Kok Town 
1. The boundary starts at the eastern corner of the base of the 
Sha Tau Kok pier (“Point 1”, Latitude 22˚32'37.21" North, Longitude 
114˚13'34.85" East). From there, it runs directly to the mouth of the 
ditch running along the eastern side of San Lau Street. It then follows 
the centre line of the ditch, as far as the point where that line meets the 
centre line of Chung Ying Street (“Point 2”, Latitude 22˚32'45.42" North, 
Longitude 114˚13'32.40" East). 
2. From Point 2, the boundary follows the centre line of Chung Ying 
Street as far as the point where that line meets the centre line of Bubu 
Street (“Point 3”, Latitude 22˚32'52.26" North, Longitude 114˚13'36.91” 
East). 
3. From Point 3, the boundary follows a straight line to the western 
tip of the base of the foundation of Sha Tau Kok River Bridge in the 
middle of the river (“Point 4”, Latitude 22˚32'52.83" North, Longitude 
114˚13’36.86" East). 
(2) Sha Tau Kok Town to Pak Kung Au 
From Point 4, the boundary runs upstream along the centre line 
of the Sha Tau Kok River and thence along the bottom line of the 
valley east of Pak Kung Au until it reaches the middle of the Pak Kung 
Au saddle point (“Point 5”, Latitude 22˚33'23.49" North, Longitude 
114˚12'24.25" East). 
149 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
(3) Pak Kung Au to the Mouth of the Shenzhen River 
The boundary runs from Point 5 along the bottom line of the main 
valley west of Pak Kung Au as far as the source of the Shenzhen River at 
Pak Kung Au. It continues along the centre line of the Shenzhen River to 
the mouth of the river at Shenzhen Bay (otherwise known as Deep Bay). 
After the realignment of the Shenzhen River, the boundary will 
follow the new centre line of the river. 
II. The Sea Sector 
The sea sector comprises three sections as follows: 
(1) Shenzhen Bay 
From the mouth of the Shenzhen River, the boundary runs along the 
middle of the southern navigable channel as far as Beacon 84 (otherwise 
known as “B” Beacon) (“Point 6”, Latitude 22˚30'36.23" North, 
Longitude 113˚59'42.20" East). From there, it follows straight lines in 
sequence through the following two points: 
1. Beacon 83 (otherwise known as “A” Beacon) in Shenzhen Bay 
(“Point 7”, Latitude 22˚28'20.49" North, Longitude 113˚56'52.10" East); 
and 
2. “Point 8”, (Latitude 22˚25'43.7" North, Longitude 113˚52'08.8" 
East), defined as the point where the line between Point 7 and 
Dongjiaozui at the southernmost tip of Neilingding Island intersects the 
meridian line of Longitude 113˚52'08.8" East. 
(2) Southern Sea Section

Instrument 13 
* Explanations of Some Questions by the Standing 
Committee of the National People’s Congress Concerning the 
Implementation of the Nationality Law of the People’s 
Republic of China in the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region 
(Adopted at the Nineteenth Session of the Standing Committee of 
the Eighth National People’s Congress on 15 May 1996) 
According to Article 18 of and Annex III to the Basic Law of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic 
of China, the Nationality Law of the People’s Republic of China shall 
be applied in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region from 
1 July 1997. Taking account of the historical background and the 
existing circumstances of Hong Kong, the Standing Committee gives the 
following explanations concerning the implementation in the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region of the Nationality Law of the People’s 
Republic of China­
1. Where a Hong Kong resident is of Chinese descent and was born 
in the Chinese territories (including Hong Kong), or where a person 
satisfies the criteria laid down in the Nationality Law of the People’s 
Republic of China for having Chinese nationality, he is a Chinese 
national. 
2. All Hong Kong Chinese compatriots are Chinese nationals, 
whether or not they are holders of the “British Dependent Territories 
Citizens passport” or “British Nationals (Overseas) passport”. With 
effect from 1 July 1997, Chinese nationals mentioned above may, for 
the purpose of travelling to other countries and territories, continue 
to use the valid travel documents issued by the Government of the 
United Kingdom. However, they shall not be entitled to British consular 
protection in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and other 
parts of the People’s Republic of China on account of their holding the 
above mentioned British travel documents. 
161 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
  
 
 
3. According to the Nationality Law of the People’s Republic of 
China, the British Citizenship acquired by Chinese nationals in Hong 
Kong through the “British Nationality Selection Scheme” will not be 
recognised. They are still Chinese nationals and will not be entitled to 
British consular protection in the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region and other parts of the People’s Republic of China. 
4. Chinese nationals of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region with right of abode in foreign countries may, for the purpose of 
travelling to other countries and territories, use the relevant documents 
issued by the foreign governments. However, they will not be entitled to 
consular protection in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
and other parts of the People’s Republic of China on account of their 
holding the above mentioned documents. 
5. If there is a change in the nationality of a Chinese national of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, he may, with valid 
documents in support, make a declaration at the authority of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region responsible for nationality 
applications. 
6. The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region is authorised to designate its Immigration Department as the 
authority of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region responsible 
for nationality applications. The Immigration Department of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall handle all nationality 
applications in accordance with the Nationality Law of the People’s 
Republic of China and the foregoing provisions.

Instrument 14 
* Decision of the Standing Committee of the National 
People’s Congress on Treatment of the Laws Previously in 
Force in Hong Kong in Accordance with Article 160 of the 
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region of the People’s Republic of China 
(Adopted at the Twenty Fourth Session of the Standing 
Committee of the Eighth National People’s Congress on 
23 February 1997) 
Article 160 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China (hereinafter 
referred to as “the Basic Law”) stipulates: 
“Upon the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region, the laws previously in force in Hong Kong shall be adopted as 
laws of the Region except for those which the Standing Committee of the 
National People’s Congress declares to be in contravention of this Law. 
If any laws are later discovered to be in contravention of this Law, they 
shall be amended or cease to have force in accordance with the procedure 
as prescribed by this Law.” 
Article 8 stipulates: 
“The laws previously in force in Hong Kong, that is, the common 
law, rules of equity, ordinances, subordinate legislation and customary 
law shall be maintained, except for any that contravene this Law, and 
subject to any amendment by the legislature of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region.” 
In accordance with the above provisions, the Standing Committee of 
the Eighth National People’s Congress examined the proposals made by 
the Preparatory Committee of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region on treatment of issues relating to the laws previously in force in 
Hong Kong, and decides at its Twenty Fourth Session as follows: 
163 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
1. The laws previously in force in Hong Kong, which include the 
common law, rules of equity, ordinances, subordinate legislation and 
customary law, except for those which are in contravention of the Basic 
Law, are adopted as the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region. 
2. Such of the ordinances and subordinate legislation previously 
in force in Hong Kong as set out in Annex 1 to this Decision are in 
contravention of the Basic Law and are not adopted as the laws of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. 
3. Such provisions of the ordinances and subordinate legislation 
previously in force in Hong Kong as set out in Annex 2 to this Decision 
are in contravention of the Basic Law and those provisions are not 
adopted as the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. 
4. Such of the laws previously in force in Hong Kong which have 
been adopted as the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region shall, as from 1 July 1997, be applied subject to such 
modifications, adaptations, limitations or exceptions as are necessary 
so as to bring them into conformity with the status of Hong Kong 
after resumption by the People’s Republic of China of the exercise of 
sovereignty over Hong Kong as well as to be in conformity with the 
relevant provisions of the Basic Law. For example, the New Territories 
Land (Exemption) Ordinance should conform with the above principles 
in its application. 
Apart from conforming with the above principles, the following shall 
be observed, that is to say, in the ordinances and subordinate legislation 
previously in force: 
(1) laws relating to foreign affairs in respect of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region which are inconsistent with the national 
laws applied in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be 
subject to the national laws and shall be consistent with the international 
rights and obligations of the Central People’s Government; 
164 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Commonwealth countries or territories, other than provisions relating to 
reciprocal arrangements between Hong Kong and the United Kingdom 
or other Commonwealth countries or territories, are not retained; 
(3) provisions relating to the rights, exemptions and obligations 
of military forces stationed in Hong Kong by the United Kingdom are 
retained subject to the provisions of the Basic Law and the Law of the 
People’s Republic of China on the Garrisoning of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, and shall apply 
to the military forces stationed in the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region by the Central People’s Government of the People’s Republic of 
China; 
(4) provisions relating to the superior legal status of the English 
language as compared with the Chinese language shall be construed as 
providing that both the Chinese and English languages are to be official 
languages; 
(5) provisions applying any English law may continue to be 
applicable by reference thereto as a transitional arrangement pending 
their amendment by the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, 
provided that they are not prejudicial to the sovereignty of the People’s 
Republic of China and do not contravene the provisions of the Basic 
Law. 
5. Subject to the provisions of paragraph 4, the names or expressions 
appearing in the laws previously in force in Hong Kong that are adopted 
as the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall, unless 
the context otherwise requires, be construed or applied in accordance 
with the principles of substitution provided for in Annex 3 to this Decision. 
6. If any laws previously in force in Hong Kong which have been 
adopted as the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
are later discovered to be in contravention of the Basic Law, they shall be 
amended or shall cease to have force in accordance with the procedure as 
prescribed by the Basic Law.

* The Interpretation by the Standing Committee of the National People’s 
Congress Regarding Paragraph 4 in Article 22 and Category (3) of 
Paragraph 2 in Article 24 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China 
(Adopted at the Tenth Meeting of the Standing Committee of the 
Ninth National People’s Congress on 26 June 1999) 
At its 10th Meeting, the Standing Committee of the Ninth National 
People’s Congress discussed the State Council’s Proposal for Giving 
an Interpretation to Paragraph 4 in Article 22 and Category (3) of 
Paragraph 2 in Article 24 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China. It is in order to 
respond to the report submitted by the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region in accordance with the relevant provisions 
of Article 43 and those of Category (2) of Article 48 of the Basic Law of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic 
of China that the State Council has put forward the proposal. In view of 
the fact that the issue raised in the proposal concerns the interpretation 
of the relevant articles of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China by the Court 
of Final Appeal of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 
its judgment made on 29 January 1999, that these provisions concern 
affairs which are the responsibility of the Central Authorities and the 
relationship between the Central Authorities and the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region, that the Court of Final Appeal, before making 
its judgment, failed to seek an interpretation of the provisions from the 
Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress in accordance 
with the provisions of Paragraph 3 in Article 158 of the Basic Law of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of 
China and that the interpretation of the Court of Final Appeal is not in 
conformity with the original legislative intent, the Standing Committee 
of the National People’s Congress, after consulting its Committee for the 
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, decides to 
give the following interpretations to the relevant provisions in the Basic 
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s 
171 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
Republic of China in accordance with the provisions of Category (4) 
of Article 67 of the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China and 
Paragraph 1 in Article 158 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China: 
1. The provisions of Paragraph 4 in Article 22 of the Basic Law of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic 
of China “for entry into the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, 
people from other parts of China must apply for approval”, mean that 
persons from provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly 
under the Central Government, including the children of permanent 
residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region born in the 
mainland with Chinese nationality, who request to enter the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region with whatever reason shall, in accordance 
with the provisions of relevant laws and administrative regulations of 
the State, apply for approval from the relevant government department 
in the place of their residence and may only enter the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region with valid certificates issued by relevant 
authorities. It’s illegal for any persons or children mentioned above 
to enter the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region without going 
through due approval procedures in accordance with the provisions of 
relevant laws and administrative regulations of the State. 
2. The first three categories of Paragraph 2 in Article 24 of the Basic 
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s 
Republic of China provide: “The permanent residents of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region shall be: (1) Chinese citizens born in 
Hong Kong before or after the establishment of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region; (2) Chinese citizens who have ordinarily resided 
in Hong Kong for a continuous period of not less than seven years before 
or after the establishment of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region; (3) Persons of Chinese nationality born outside Hong Kong of 
those residents listed in categories (1) and (2)”. Among these people, the 
persons provided for in Category (3) “Persons of Chinese nationality 
born outside Hong Kong of those residents listed in categories (1) 
and (2)” mean that those persons, at the time of their birth, no matter 
whether they were born before or after the establishment of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region, whose parents or whose fathers or 
172 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
  
mothers are Chinese citizens as provided for in Category (1) or Category 
(2) of Paragraph 2 in Article 24 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region. The original legislative intent elucidated 
by this Interpretation and the original legislative intent of the other 
categories of Paragraph 2 in Article 24 of the Basic Law of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region have been embodied in the Opinions 
on the Implementation of the Second Paragraph of Article 24 of the Basic 
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s 
Republic of China, which were adopted at the Fourth Plenary Meeting 
of the Preparatory Committee for the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region of the National People’s Congress on 10 August 1996. 
After promulgation of this Interpretation, the courts of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region shall, in applying the relevant 
articles of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region of the People’s Republic of China, follow this Interpretation. 
This Interpretation does not affect the right of abode in the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region granted to the litigating party in the 
case through the judgment made by the Court of Final Appeal of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region on 29 January 1999. As to 
whether any other person conforms to the provisions of Category (3) of 
Paragraph 2 in Article 24 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region, the matter shall be decided according to this 
Interpretation.

Instrument 17 
* Decision of the Standing Committee of the National 
People’s Congress on Issues Relating to the Methods for 
Selecting the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region in the Year 2007 and for Forming 
the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region in the Year 2008 
(Adopted at the Ninth Session of the Standing Committee of the 
Tenth National People’s Congress on 26 April 2004) 
The Standing Committee of the Tenth National People’s Congress 
examined at its Ninth Session the “Report on whether there is a need 
to amend the methods for selecting the Chief Executive of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region in 2007 and for forming the 
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 
2008” submitted by Tung Chee-hwa, the Chief Executive of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region, on 15 April 2004 and, before 
the Session, had consulted the Hong Kong deputies to the National 
People’s Congress, the Hong Kong members of the National Committee 
of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, different 
sectors of Hong Kong, the Hong Kong members of the Committee 
for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
under the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, and 
the Constitutional Development Task Force of the Government of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and had also sought the 
views of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council. 
The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress was, in the 
course of the examination, fully aware of the recent concerns of the Hong 
Kong society about the methods for selecting the Chief Executive and for 
forming the Legislative Council after the year 2007, including the views 
of some bodies and people that they wish to see the selection of the Chief 
Executive by universal suffrage in the year 2007 and the election of all 
the members of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage in the year 
2008. 
The Session is of the view that Articles 45 and 68 of the Basic Law of 
177 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic 
of China (hereinafter referred to as “Hong Kong Basic Law”) already 
expressly provide that the methods for selecting the Chief Executive 
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and for forming the 
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
shall be specified in the light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region and in accordance with the principle 
of gradual and orderly progress, and that the ultimate aims are the 
selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage upon nomination 
by a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance 
with democratic procedures and the election of all the members of the 
Legislative Council by universal suffrage. The methods for selecting the 
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and for 
forming the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region shall conform to the above principles and provisions of the 
Hong Kong Basic Law. Any change relating to the methods for selecting 
the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
and for forming the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region shall conform to principles such as being 
compatible with the social, economic, political development of Hong 
Kong, being conducive to the balanced participation of all sectors and 
groups of the society, being conducive to the effective operation of the 
executive-led system, being conducive to the maintenance of the long­
term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. 
The Session is of the view that since the establishment of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region, Hong Kong residents have enjoyed 
democratic rights that they have never had before. The first Chief 
Executive was elected by the Selection Committee, which was composed 
of 400 members. The second Chief Executive was elected by the Election 
Committee, which was composed of 800 members. Out of the 60 
members of the Legislative Council, the number of members returned 
by geographical constituencies through direct elections increased from 
20 in the Legislative Council in the first term to 24 in the Legislative 
Council in the second term and will reach 30 in the Legislative Council 
in the third term to be formed this September. Hong Kong does not 
have a long history of practising democratic elections. Until now, Hong 
Kong residents have exercised the democratic right to participate in the 
178 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
selection of the Chief Executive of the Special Administrative Region 
for less than 7 years. Since the reunification of Hong Kong with the 
motherland, the number of members of the Legislative Council returned 
by geographical constituencies through direct elections has already 
substantially increased. When the set-up is such that half of the members 
are returned by geographical constituencies through direct elections 
and half of the members are returned by functional constituencies, the 
impact on the operation of the Hong Kong society as a whole, especially 
the impact on the executive-led system, remains to be examined through 
practice. Further, at present, different sectors of the Hong Kong society 
still have considerable differences on how to determine the methods 
for selecting the Chief Executive and for forming the Legislative 
Council after the year 2007 and have not come to a broad consensus. 
In the circumstances, conditions do not exist for the selection of the 
Chief Executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly 
representative nominating committee in accordance with democratic 
procedures as provided for in Article 45 of the Hong Kong Basic Law 
and the election of all the members of the Legislative Council by universal 
suffrage as provided for in Article 68 of the Hong Kong Basic Law. 
In the light of the above and pursuant to the relevant provisions 
of the Hong Kong Basic Law and “The Interpretation by the Standing 
Committee of the National People’s Congress of Article 7 of Annex I 
and Article III of Annex II to the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China”, the Standing 
Committee of the National People’s Congress makes the following 
decision on the methods for selecting the Chief Executive of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region in the year 2007 and for forming 
the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
in the year 2008: 
1. The election of the third Chief Executive of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region to be held in the year 2007 shall not be 
by means of universal suffrage. The election of the Legislative Council 
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the fourth term in 
the year 2008 shall not be by means of an election of all the members by 
universal suffrage. The ratio between members returned by functional 
constituencies and members returned by geographical constituencies 
179 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
through direct elections, who shall respectively occupy half of the seats, is 
to remain unchanged. The procedures for voting on bills and motions in 
the Legislative Council are to remain unchanged. 
2. Subject to Article 1 of this Decision not being contravened, 
appropriate amendments that conform to the principle of gradual and 
orderly progress may be made to the specific method for selecting the 
third Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
in the year 2007 and the specific method for forming the Legislative 
Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the fourth 
term in the year 2008 according to the provisions of Articles 45 and 68 of 
the Hong Kong Basic Law and the provisions of Article 7 of Annex I and 
Article III of Annex II to the Hong Kong Basic Law. 
The Session is of the view that developing democracy in the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region in the light of the actual situation 
and in a gradual and orderly manner according to the provisions of the 
Hong Kong Basic Law has all along been the resolute and firm stance 
of the Central Authorities. With the development and progress in all 
aspects of the Hong Kong society and through the joint endeavours 
of the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
and Hong Kong residents, the democratic system of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region will certainly be able to progress forward 
incessantly, and ultimately attain the aims of selecting the Chief Executive 
by universal suffrage upon nomination by a broadly representative 
nominating committee in accordance with democratic procedures and 
electing all the members of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage 
provided for in the Hong Kong Basic Law.

(Adopted at the Fifteenth Meeting of the Standing Committee of the 
Tenth National People’s Congress on 27 April 2005) 
At its 15th Meeting, the Standing Committee of the Tenth National 
People’s Congress discussed the State Council’s Proposal for Giving 
an Interpretation to the Second Paragraph in Article 53 of the Basic 
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s

the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the Standing Committee 
of the National People’s Congress, in accordance with the provisions of 
the fourth paragraph in Article 67 of the Constitution of the People’s 
Republic of China and the first paragraph in Article 158 of the Basic 
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s 
Republic of China, gives the following interpretation to the provisions of 
the second paragraph in Article 53 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China: 
The second paragraph in Article 53 of the Basic Law of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’ s Republic of China 
stipulates, “In the event that the office of Chief Executive becomes 
vacant, a new Chief Executive shall be selected within six months in 
accordance with the provisions of Article 45 of this Law.” The provision 
that “a new Chief Executive shall be selected within six months in 
accordance with the provisions of Article 45 of this Law” means that 
a new Chief Executive shall be selected in accordance with the method 
of selection provided for under Article 45 of the Basic Law, and that 
the term of office of the new Chief Executive shall be determined in 
accordance with the method of selection provided for under Article 45 of 
the Basic Law. 
The third paragraph in Article 45 of the Basic Law of the Hong 
181 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
  
Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China 
stipulates, “The specific method for selecting the Chief Executive is 
prescribed in Annex I ‘Method for the Selection of the Chief Executive 
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region’.” Clause 1 of 
Annex I stipulates, “The Chief Executive shall be elected by a broadly 
representative Election Committee in accordance with this Law and

of a two-thirds majority of all the members of the Legislative Council 
and the consent of the Chief Executive, and they shall be reported the 
Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress for approval.” 
The provisions mentioned above indicate that before the year of 2007, 
under the arrangement made according to the system whereby the Chief 
Executive is elected by the Election Committee, the term of office of 
which is five years, in the event that the office of Chief Executive becomes 
vacant before the expiration of the five years prescribed in Article 46 of 
the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the 
People’s Republic of China, the term of office of the new Chief Executive 
shall be the remainder of the term of office of the previous Chief Executive; 
after 2007, should amendment be made to the above-mentioned method 
for selecting the Chief Executive, the term of office of the new Chief 
Executive shall be determined according to the specific method amended 
for selecting the Chief Executive, in the event that the office of the then 
Chief Executive becomes vacant. 
This Interpretation is hereby announced.

* Interpretation by the Standing Committee of the National People’s 
Congress Regarding the First Paragraph of Article 13 and Article 19 of 
the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region of the People’s Republic of China 
(Adopted at the Twenty Second Meeting of the Standing Committee of 
the Eleventh National People’s Congress on 26 August 2011) 
The Standing Committee of the Eleventh National People’s Congress 
deliberated at its 22nd Meeting the Draft Interpretation by the Standing 
Committee of the National People’s Congress Regarding the first 
paragraph of Article 13 and Article 19 of the Basic Law of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China 
which was proposed for deliberation by the Chairmen’s Council. The 
proposal of the Chairmen’s Council was submitted upon the report by 
the Court of Final Appeal of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
requesting the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress 
to interpret the relevant provisions of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, in 
accordance with the third paragraph of Article 158 of the Basic Law of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic 
of China. 
The Court of Final Appeal of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region needs to ascertain, in adjudicating a case involving the 
Democratic Republic of Congo, whether the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region should apply the rules or polices on state 
immunity as determined by the Central People’s Government. For this 
purpose, in accordance with the provisions of the third paragraph of 
Article 158 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region of the People’s Republic of China, the Court of Final Appeal of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region seeks an interpretation 
from the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on 
the following questions: “(1) whether on the true interpretation of the 
first paragraph of Article 13, the Central People’s Government has 
the power to determine the rule or policy of the People’s Republic of 
192 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
China on state immunity; (2) if so, whether on the true interpretation 
of the first paragraph of Article 13 and Article 19, the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), including the courts of the 
HKSAR: (i) is bound to apply or give effect to the rule or policy on 
state immunity determined by the Central People’s Government under 
the first paragraph of Article 13; or (ii) on the other hand, is at liberty 
to depart from the rule or policy on state immunity determined by the 
Central People’s Government under the first paragraph of Article 13 and 
to adopt a different rule; (3) whether the determination by the Central 
People’s Government as to the rule or policy on state immunity falls 
within “acts of the State such as national defense and foreign affairs” in 
the first sentence of the third paragraph of Article 19 of the Basic Law; 
and (4) whether, upon the establishment of the HKSAR, the effect of the 
first paragraph of Article 13, Article 19 and the status of Hong Kong as 
a special administrative region of the People’s Republic of China upon 
the common law on state immunity previously in force in Hong Kong 
(this is, before 1 July 1997), to the extent that such common law was 
inconsistent with the rule or policy on state immunity as determined 
by the Central People’s Government pursuant to the first paragraph of 
Article 13, was to require such common law to be applied subject to such 
modifications, adaptations, limitations or exceptions as were necessary 
to ensure that such common law is consistent with the rule or policy 
on state immunity as determined by the Central People’s Government, 
in accordance with Article 8 and Article 160 of the Basic Law and the 
Decisions of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress 
issued on 23 February 1997 made pursuant to Article 160.” The above 
request for interpretation by the Court of Final Appeal of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region complies with the provisions of the 
third paragraph of Aricle 158 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China. 
Pursuant to Subparagraph (4) of Article 67 of the Constitution of the 
People’s Republic of China and Article 158 of the Basic Law of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, 
and after consulting the Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region under the Standing Committee of the 
National People’s Congress, the Standing Committee of the National 
People’s Congress, in relation to the request for interpretation by the 
193 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Court of Final Appeal of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, 
hereby makes the following interpretation of the provisions of the first 
paragraph of Article 13 and Article 19 of the Basic Law of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China 
and related issues: 
1. On question (1) on which an interpretation is sought by the Court 
of Final Appeal of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. 
According to Subparagraph (9), Article 89 of the Constitution of the 
People’s Republic of China, the State Council as the Central People’s 
Government exercises the function and power to conduct the foreign 
affairs of the State; as the rules or polices on state immunity fall within 
diplomatic affairs in the realm of the foreign affairs of the state, the 
Central People’s Government has the power to determine the rules 
or polices of the People’s Republic of China on state immunity to be 
given effect to uniformly in the territory of the People’s Republic of 
China. Based on the above, in accordance with the provisions of the 
first paragraph of Article 13 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China that “the 
Central People’s Government shall be responsible for the foreign affairs 
relating to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region”, the conduct 
of the foreign affairs relating to the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region falls within the power of the Central People’s Government. 
The Central People’s Government has the power to determine the rules 
or polices on state immunity to be applied in the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region. 
2. On question (2) on which an interpretation is sought by the Court 
of Final Appeal of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. 
According to the provisions of the first paragraph of Article 13 of the 
Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the 
People’s Republic of China and Article 1 of this Interpretation, the 
Central People’s Government has the power to determine the rules 
or polices on state immunity to be applied in the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region. According to the provisions of Article 19 of 
the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the 
People’s Republic of China and Article 3 of this Interpretation, the courts 
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region have no jurisdiction 
194 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
over the act of the Central People’s Government in determining the rules 
or polices on state immunity. Therefore, when questions of immunity 
from jurisdiction and immunity from execution of foreign states and 
their properties arise in the adjudication of cases, the courts of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region must apply and give effect 
to the rules or polices on state immunity determined by the Central 
People’s Government as being applicable to the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region. Based on the above, in accordance with the 
provisions of the first paragraph of Article 13 and Article 19 of the Basic 
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s 
Republic of China, the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, 
including the courts of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, 
is under a duty to apply or give effect to the rules or polices on state 
immunity that the Central People’s Government has determined, and 
must not depart from the abovementioned rules or polices nor adopt a 
rule that is inconsistent with the abovementioned rules or polices. 
3. On question (3) on which an interpretation is sought by the Court 
of Final Appeal of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. State 
immunity concerns whether the courts of a state have jurisdiction over 
foreign states and their properties and whether foreign states and their 
properties enjoy immunity in the courts of a state. It directly relates to 
the state’s foreign relations and international rights and obligations. 
Therefore, the determination as to the rules or polices on state immunity 
is an act of state involving foreign affairs. Based on the above, “acts of 
the State such as national defense and foreign affairs” as stipulated in the 
third paragraph of Article 19 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China includes the act 
of determination by the Central People’s Government as to the rules or 
policies on state immunity. 
4. On question (4) on which an interpretation is sought by the Court 
of Final Appeal of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. 
According to the provisions of Article 8 and 160 of the Basic Law of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of 
China, the laws previously in force in Hong Kong shall be maintained 
only if there is no contravention of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China. 
195 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   
 
In accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the Decision of the 
Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress Concerning 
the Handling of the Laws Previously in Force in Hong Kong in 
Accordance with Article 160 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, such of the 
laws previously in force in Hong Kong which have been adopted as 
the laws of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall, as 
from 1 July 1997, be applied subject to such modification, adaptations, 
limitations or exceptions as are necessary so as to bring them into 
conformity with the status of Hong Kong after resumption by the 
People’s Republic of China of the exercise of sovereignty over Hong 
Kong as well as to be in conformity with the relevant provisions of the 
Basic Law. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, as a local 
administrative region of the People’s Republic of China that enjoys a 
high degree of autonomy and comes directly under the Central People’s 
Government, must give effect to the rules or polices on state immunity as 
determined by the Central People’s Government. The laws previously in 
force in Hong Kong relating to the rules on state immunity may continue 
to be applied after 1 July 1997 only if they comply with the above 
requirements. Based on the above, in accordance with the provisions of 
the first paragraph of Article 13 and Article 19 of the Basic Law of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of 
China, such of the laws previously in force in Hong Kong concerning the 
rules on state immunity which have been adopted as the laws of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region according to the Decision of the 
Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress Concerning the 
Handling of the Laws Previously in Force in Accordance with Article 160 
of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of 
the People’s Republic of China, which applied as from 1 July 1997, must 
be subject to such modifications, adaptations, limitations or exceptions 
as are necessary so as to be consistent with the rules or polices on state 
immunity that the Central People’s Government has determined. 
The Interpretation is hereby announced.

Instrument 25 
* Decision of the Standing Committee of the 
National People’s Congress on Issues Relating to the Selection of the 
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region by 
Universal Suffrage and on the Method for Forming the Legislative 
Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
in the Year 2016 
(Adopted at the Tenth Session of the Standing Committee of the Twelfth 
National People’s Congress on 31 August 2014) 
The Standing Committee of the Twelfth National People’s 
Congress considered at its Tenth Session the Report on whether there 
is a need to amend the methods for selecting the Chief Executive of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 2017 and for forming the 
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 
2016 submitted by Leung Chun-ying, the Chief Executive of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region, on 15 July 2014. In the course 
of deliberation, the relevant views and suggestions of the Hong Kong 
community were given full consideration. 
The Session points out that according to the Decision of the 
Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on Issues 
Relating to the Methods for Selecting the Chief Executive of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region and for Forming the Legislative 
Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the Year 
2012 and on Issues Relating to Universal Suffrage adopted by the 
Standing Committee of the Tenth National People’s Congress at its 
Thirty-first Session on 29 December 2007, the election of the fifth 
Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in 
the year 2017 may be implemented by the method of universal suffrage; 
at an appropriate time prior to the selection of the Chief Executive of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region by universal suffrage, 
the Chief Executive shall make a report to the Standing Committee 
of the National People’s Congress as regards the issue of amending 
the method for selecting the Chief Executive in accordance with the 
relevant provisions of the Hong Kong Basic Law and the Interpretation 
197 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
 
by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress of Article 
7 of Annex I and Article III of Annex II to the Basic Law of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, 
and a determination thereon shall be made by the Standing Committee 
of the National People’s Congress. From 4 December 2013 to 
3 May 2014, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region conducted an extensive and in-depth public consultation on the 
methods for selecting the Chief Executive in 2017 and for forming the 
Legislative Council in 2016. In the course of consultation, the Hong 
Kong community generally expressed the hope to see the selection of 
the Chief Executive by universal suffrage in 2017, and broad consensus 
was reached on important principles such as: the method for selecting 
the Chief Executive by universal suffrage shall comply with the Hong 
Kong Basic Law and the relevant Decisions of the Standing Committee 
of the National People’s Congress and the Chief Executive shall be a 
person who loves the country and loves Hong Kong. With respect to 
the methods for selecting the Chief Executive by universal suffrage 
in 2017 and for forming the Legislative Council in 2016, the Hong 
Kong community put forward various views and suggestions. It was 
on this basis that the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region made a report to the Standing Committee of 
the National People’s Congress on issues relating to amending the 
methods for selecting the Chief Executive in 2017 and for forming 
the Legislative Council in 2016. The Session is of the view that the 
report complies with the requirements of the Hong Kong Basic Law, 
the Interpretation by the Standing Committee of the National People’s 
Congress of Article 7 of Annex I and Article III of Annex II to the Hong 
Kong Basic Law and the relevant Decisions of the Standing Committee 
of the National People’s Congress, and reflects comprehensively and 
objectively the views collected during the public consultation; and is 
thus a positive, responsible and pragmatic report. 
The Session is of the view that implementing universal suffrage for 
the selection of the Chief Executive represents a historic progress in 
Hong Kong’s democratic development and a significant change in the 
political structure of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. 
Since the long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and the 
sovereignty, security and development interests of the country are 
198 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
at stake, there is a need to proceed in a prudent and steady manner. 
The selection of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region by universal suffrage has its origin in Paragraph 
2 of Article 45 of the Hong Kong Basic Law: “The method for selecting 
the Chief Executive shall be specified in the light of the actual situation 
in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and in accordance 
with the principle of gradual and orderly progress. The ultimate aim 
is the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage upon 
nomination by a broadly representative nominating committee in 
accordance with democratic procedures.” The formulation of the 
method for selecting the Chief Executive by universal suffrage must 
strictly comply with the relevant provisions of the Hong Kong Basic 
Law, accord with the principle of “one country, two systems”, and 
befit the legal status of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region. It must meet the interests of different sectors of the society, 
achieve balanced participation, be conducive to the development of 
the capitalist economy, and make gradual and orderly progress in 
developing a democratic system that suits the actual situation in Hong 
Kong. Given the divergent views within the Hong Kong community 
on how to implement the Hong Kong Basic Law provisions on 
universal suffrage for selecting the Chief Executive, and in light of 
the constitutional responsibility of the Standing Committee of the 
National People’s Congress for the proper implementation of the Hong 
Kong Basic Law and for deciding on the method for the selection of 
the Chief Executive, the Standing Committee of the National People’s 
Congress finds it necessary to make provisions on certain core issues 
concerning the method for selecting the Chief Executive by universal 
suffrage, so as to facilitate the building of consensus within the Hong 
Kong community and the attainment of universal suffrage for the 
selection of the Chief Executive smoothly and in accordance with law. 
The Session is of the view that since the Chief Executive of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall be accountable to both 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Central People’s 
Government in accordance with the provisions of the Hong Kong 
Basic Law, the principle that the Chief Executive has to be a person 
who loves the country and loves Hong Kong must be upheld. This is 
a basic requirement of the policy of “one country, two systems”. It 
is determined by the legal status as well as important functions and 
199 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
duties of the Chief Executive, and is called for by the actual need to 
maintain long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong and uphold 
the sovereignty, security and development interests of the country. The 
method for selecting the Chief Executive by universal suffrage must 
provide corresponding institutional safeguards for this purpose. 
The Session is of the view that the amendments made to the 
method for forming the fifth term Legislative Council in 2012 
represented major strides towards the direction of enhancing 
democracy. The existing formation method and voting procedures for 
the Legislative Council as prescribed in Annex II to the Hong Kong 
Basic Law will not be amended, and will continue to apply in respect of 
the sixth term Legislative Council in 2016. This is consistent with the 
principle of gradual and orderly progress in developing a democratic 
system that suits Hong Kong’s actual situation and conforms to 
the majority view in the Hong Kong community. It also helps the 
various sectors of the Hong Kong community to focus their efforts on 
addressing the issues concerning universal suffrage for selecting the 
Chief Executive first, thus creating the conditions for attaining the 
aim of electing all the members of the Legislative Council by universal 
suffrage after the implementation of universal suffrage for the selection 
of the Chief Executive. 
Accordingly, pursuant to the relevant provisions of the Basic Law 
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic 
of China, the Interpretation by the Standing Committee of the National 
People’s Congress of Article 7 of Annex I and Article III of Annex II to 
the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the 
People’s Republic of China and the Decision of the Standing Committee 
of the National People’s Congress on Issues Relating to the Methods for 
Selecting the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region and for Forming the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region in the Year 2012 and on Issues Relating to 
Universal Suffrage, the Standing Committee of the National People’s 
Congress makes the following decision: 
I. Starting from 2017, the selection of the Chief Executive of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region may be implemented by the 
method of universal suffrage.

II. When the selection of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region is implemented by the method of 
universal suffrage: 
(1) A broadly representative nominating committee shall be formed. 
The provisions for the number of members, composition and formation 
method of the nominating committee shall be made in accordance with 
the number of members, composition and formation method of the 
Election Committee for the Fourth Chief Executive. 
(2) The nominating committee shall nominate two to three 
candidates for the office of Chief Executive in accordance with 
democratic procedures. Each candidate must have the endorsement of 
more than half of all the members of the nominating committee. 
(3) All eligible electors of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region have the right to vote in the election of the Chief Executive 
and elect one of the candidates for the office of Chief Executive in 
accordance with law. 
(4) The Chief Executive-elect, after being selected through 
universal suffrage, will have to be appointed by the Central People’s 
Government. 
III. The specific method of universal suffrage for selecting the 
Chief Executive shall be prescribed in accordance with legal procedures 
through amending Annex I to the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China: The Method 
for the Selection of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region. The bill on the amendments and the proposed 
amendments to such bill shall be introduced by the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region Government to the Legislative Council of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in accordance with 
the Hong Kong Basic Law and the provisions of this Decision. Such 
amendments shall obtain the endorsement of a two-thirds majority 
of all the members of the Legislative Council and the consent of the 
Chief Executive before being submitted to the Standing Committee of 
the National People’s Congress for approval. 
201 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
IV. If the specific method of universal suffrage for selecting the 
Chief Executive is not adopted in accordance with legal procedures, the 
method used for selecting the Chief Executive for the preceding term 
shall continue to apply. 
V. The existing formation method and voting procedures for the 
Legislative Council as prescribed in Annex II to the Hong Kong Basic 
Law will not be amended. The formation method and procedures for 
voting on bills and motions of the fifth term Legislative Council will 
continue to apply to the sixth term Legislative Council of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region in 2016. After the election of the 
Chief Executive by universal suffrage, the election of all the members 
of the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region may be implemented by the method of universal suffrage.  At 
an appropriate time prior to the election of the Legislative Council by 
universal suffrage, the Chief Executive elected by universal suffrage 
shall submit a report to the Standing Committee of the National 
People’s Congress in accordance with the relevant provisions of 
the Hong Kong Basic Law and the Interpretation by the Standing 
Committee of the National People’s Congress of Article 7 of Annex I 
and Article III of Annex II to the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China as regards the 
issue of amending the method for forming the Legislative Council. A 
determination thereon shall be made by the Standing Committee of the 
National People’s Congress. 
The Session stresses that it is the consistent position of the central 
authorities to implement resolutely and firmly the principles of “one 
country, two systems”, “Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong” 
and a high degree of autonomy, strictly adhere to the Hong Kong Basic 
Law and steadily take forward the selection of the Chief Executive 
by universal suffrage in 2017. It is hoped that the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region Government and all sectors of the Hong Kong 
community will act in accordance with the provisions of the Hong Kong 
Basic Law and this Decision and jointly work towards the attainment 
of the aim of selecting the Chief Executive by universal suffrage.

* Explanations on the Draft Decision of the Standing Committee 
of the National People’s Congress on Issues Relating to the Selection 
of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region by Universal Suffrage and on the Method for Forming the 
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
in the Year 2016 
At the Tenth Session of the Standing Committee of the Twelfth 
National People’s Congress on 27 August 2014 
Li Fei 
Deputy Secretary General of 
The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress 
The Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress, 
At the request of the Chairmen’s Council, I hereby provide 
Explanations on the Draft Decision of the Standing Committee of 
the National People’s Congress on Issues Relating to the Selection of 
the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
by Universal Suffrage and on the Method for Forming the Legislative 
Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the Year 
2016. 
In accordance with the provisions of the Basic Law of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic 
of China (hereinafter referred to as the “Hong Kong Basic Law”) 
and the Interpretation by the Standing Committee of the National 
People’s Congress of Article 7 of Annex I and Article III of Annex II 
to the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of 
the People’s Republic of China, Leung Chun-ying, Chief Executive 
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, submitted the 
Report on whether there is a need to amend the methods for selecting 
the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
in 2017 and for forming the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region in 2016 (hereinafter referred to as the 
203 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
“Report by the Chief Executive”) to the NPC Standing Committee 
on 15 July 2014. On 18 August, the Chairmen’s Council decided 
to include the consideration of the Report by the Chief Executive 
in the agenda of the Tenth Session of the Standing Committee of 
the Twelfth NPC, and entrusted the responsible officials of the 
relevant departments of the central authorities to listen to the 
views of the NPC deputies and members of the Chinese People’s 
Political Consultative Conference from the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region, the Hong Kong members of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region Basic Law Committee under the NPC 
Standing Committee, and people from various sectors of the Hong 
Kong community. Opinions of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office of the State Council were also solicited. On 26 August, the 
NPC Standing Committee held group discussions on the Report by 
the Chief Executive. 
The members of the NPC Standing Committee pointed out 
that, as stipulated in Paragraph 2 of Article 45 of the Hong Kong 
Basic Law, “The method for selecting the Chief Executive shall 
be specified in the light of the actual situation in the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region and in accordance with the principle 
of gradual and orderly progress. The ultimate aim is the selection 
of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage upon nomination by 
a broadly representative nominating committee in accordance with 
democratic procedures.” The Decision of the Standing Committee of 
the National People’s Congress on Issues Relating to the Methods for 
Selecting the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region and for Forming the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region in the Year 2012 and on Issues Relating 
to Universal Suffrage adopted on 29 December 2007 expressly states, 
“that the election of the fifth Chief Executive of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region in the year 2017 may be implemented 
by the method of universal suffrage; that after the Chief Executive 
is selected by universal suffrage, the election of the Legislative 
Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region may be 
implemented by the method of electing all the members by universal 
suffrage.” The Decision also reaffirms the relevant provisions of the 
Hong Kong Basic Law and its Interpretation that at an appropriate 
204 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
time prior to the selection of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region by universal suffrage, the Chief 
Executive shall make a report to the NPC Standing Committee 
as regards the issue of amending the method for selecting the 
Chief Executive, and a determination thereon shall be made by 
the NPC Standing Committee. The members of the NPC Standing 
Committee believe that since the year 2017 is approaching, it is 
now necessary to make a decision on issues relating to the methods 
for selecting the Chief Executive in 2017 and for forming the 
Legislative Council in 2016. The Report submitted by the Chief 
Executive to the NPC Standing Committee is necessary and timely. 
The Report reflects in a comprehensive and objective manner the 
views and wishes of the Hong Kong community regarding the 
methods for selecting the Chief Executive by universal suffrage and 
for forming the Legislative Council in 2016, which include both 
consensus and differences. It is a positive, responsible and pragmatic 
report. 
The members of the Standing Committee are of the view that 
implementing universal suffrage for the selection of the Chief 
Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region represents 
a historic progress in Hong Kong’s democratic development and a 
significant change in the political structure of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region. Since the long-term prosperity and stability of 
Hong Kong and the sovereignty, security and development interests 
of the country are at stake, there is a need to proceed in a prudent and 
steady manner, so as to prevent all sorts of possible risks that may 
arise therefrom. Since the selection of the Chief Executive of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region by universal suffrage has its 
origin in the provisions of the Hong Kong Basic Law, the formulation 
of the method for selecting the Chief Executive by universal suffrage 
must strictly comply with the relevant provisions of the Hong Kong 
Basic Law, accord with the principle of “one country, two systems”, 
and befit the legal status of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region. It must meet the interests of different sectors of the society, 
achieve balanced participation, and be conducive to the development 
of the capitalist economy, with a view to making gradual and orderly 
progress in developing a democratic system that suits the actual 
205 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
situation in Hong Kong. The members of the Standing Committee 
take the view that when formulating the basic policies on Hong 
Kong, the central authorities have already clearly defined the scope 
and criteria for the principle of “Hong Kong people administering 
Hong Kong”, that is, Hong Kong must be administered by the Hong 
Kong people, with patriots being the mainstay. According to the 
Hong Kong Basic Law, the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region is the head of both the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region and the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region Government, and shall be accountable to both the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region and the Central People’s Government. 
The Chief Executive must swear to uphold the Basic Law of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China 
and swear allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
of the People’s Republic of China. Therefore, the Chief Executive of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region must be a person who 
loves the country and loves Hong Kong. This is a basic requirement 
of the policy of “one country, two systems”. It is determined by the 
legal status and important functions and duties of the Chief Executive 
as stipulated in the Hong Kong Basic Law, and called for by the actual 
need to maintain long-term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong 
and uphold the sovereignty, security and development interests of the 
country. The method for selecting the Chief Executive by universal 
suffrage should provide corresponding institutional safeguards for 
this purpose. 
The members of the NPC Standing Committee take the view 
that although 17 years have passed since the return of Hong Kong to 
the motherland, there is still a small number of people in the Hong 
Kong community who do not properly understand the policy of “one 
country, two systems”, do not abide by the Hong Kong Basic Law or 
acknowledge the Central Government’s governing power over Hong 
Kong. On the issue of universal suffrage for the Chief Executive, 
there are divergent views within the Hong Kong community. A 
small number of people have even raised views that are contrary to 
the Hong Kong Basic Law and openly advocated illegal activities. 
Such developments will inevitably undermine the rule of law of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, the interests of Hong 
206 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
 
Kong residents and foreign investors and the long-term prosperity 
and stability of Hong Kong, and hence merit close attention. The 
members of the NPC Standing Committee take the view that given 
its constitutional responsibility for the proper implementation of the 
Hong Kong Basic Law and for making decision on the method for 
selecting the Chief Executive, it is necessary for the NPC Standing 
Committee to make provisions on certain core issues concerning the 
method of universal suffrage for the selection of the Chief Executive, 
so as to facilitate the building of consensus within the Hong Kong 
community and ensure that the selection of the Chief Executive by 
universal suffrage will proceed on the right track as laid down by 
the Hong Kong Basic Law and the relevant Decisions of the NPC 
Standing Committee. 
The Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council 
takes the view that although the views are quite divergent in the Hong 
Kong community with regard to the specific method of universal 
suffrage for the selection of the Chief Executive, various sectors 
of the Hong Kong community generally hope to see the selection 
of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage in 2017. Therefore, 
in accordance with the relevant Decision of the NPC Standing 
Committee adopted on 29 December 2007, the implementation 
of the selection of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region by universal suffrage in 2017 may be approved. 
At the same time, it is necessary to make provisions on the core issues 
concerning the method of universal suffrage for selecting the Chief 
Executive, which will be conducive to building further consensus in 
the Hong Kong community. The method for forming the Legislative 
Council in 2016 may remain unchanged. 
Acting in accordance with the provisions of the Hong Kong 
Basic Law and the views of the members of the NPC Standing 
Committee on the Report by the Chief Executive, and having taken 
into full account the views of the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs 
Office of the State Council and the views of the Report by the Chief 
Executive, the Chairmen’s Council has introduced the Draft Decision 
of the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress on 
Issues Relating to the Selection of the Chief Executive of the Hong 
207 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Kong Special Administrative Region by Universal Suffrage and on the 
Method for Forming the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region in the Year 2016 (Draft Decision). I will now 
provide Explanations on the Draft Decision as follows. 
1. On the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage 
starting from 2017 
In accordance with the Hong Kong Basic Law, the relevant 
Decision of the NPC Standing Committee on 29 December 2007 and 
the views of the members of the NPC Standing Committee, Article I 
of the Draft Decision provides that: “Starting from 2017, the selection 
of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region may be implemented by the method of universal suffrage.” 
The major considerations with regard to this provision are: 
First, the wording in the Draft Decision is “Starting from 2017, 
the selection of the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region may be implemented by the method of 
universal suffrage”, meaning that the selection of the fifth Chief 
Executive in 2017 and all the Chief Executives thereafter may be 
implemented by the method of universal suffrage. 
Second, Article 45 of the Hong Kong Basic Law provides that 
the ultimate aim is the selection of the Chief Executive by universal 
suffrage. The relevant Decision of the NPC Standing Committee on 29 
December 2007 further provides that “the election of the fifth Chief 
Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region in the 
year 2017 may be implemented by the method of universal suffrage”. 
Article I of the Draft Decision has made it clear that the selection of 
the Chief Executive in 2017 and of all the Chief Executives thereafter 
may be implemented by the method of universal suffrage, which 
accords with the Hong Kong Basic Law and the above-mentioned 
Decision of the NPC Standing Committee. 
Third, as a result of years of discussion on the issue of universal 
suffrage for selecting the Chief Executive, the Hong Kong community 
has reached consensus on four points, i.e., the Hong Kong community 
208 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
generally hopes to see the implementation of universal suffrage for 
the selection of the Chief Executive in 2017; it generally agrees that 
the method of universal suffrage for the Chief Executive should 
be formulated in accordance with the Hong Kong Basic Law and 
the relevant Interpretation and Decisions of the NPC Standing 
Committee; it generally agrees that the successful implementation of 
universal suffrage for the selection of the Chief Executive will bring 
about positive impact on the sustained development and the long­
term prosperity and stability of Hong Kong; and it generally agrees 
that Chief Executive candidates should be persons who love the 
country and love Hong Kong. The implementation of the election of 
the Chief Executive by the method of universal suffrage as of 2017 
meets the common aspiration of the Hong Kong community. 
2. On the provisions on the core issues of universal suffrage for the 
Chief Executive 
Article 45 of the Hong Kong Basic Law has already set out 
quite clear provisions on universal suffrage for selecting the Chief 
Executive. In accordance with the Hong Kong Basic Law, the views of 
the members of the NPC Standing Committee and those from others, 
Article II of the Draft Decision has made the following provisions on 
the core issues of universal suffrage for the Chief Executive: 
(1) On the composition of the nominating committee 
Paragraph (1) of Article II of the Draft Decision provides that: 
“The provisions for the number of members, composition and 
formation method of the nominating committee shall be made in 
accordance with the number of members, composition and formation 
method of the Election Committee for the Fourth Chief Executive.” 
According to this provision, the nominating committee to be defined 
by amendments to Annex I to the Hong Kong Basic Law shall follow 
the current composition of the Election Committee, which consists 
of 1,200 members from four major sectors in equal proportions, and 
keep the existing method for selecting the members as provided for by 
Annex I to the Hong Kong Basic Law. The major considerations with 
regard to this provision are: 
209 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
First, considering the legislative intent of the Hong Kong Basic 
Law, the expression “broadly representative” in the context of 
“a broadly representative nominating committee”, as provided in 
Paragraph 2 of Article 45 of the Hong Kong Basic Law, carries 
the same meaning as that in “a broadly representative Election 
Committee”, as provided in Annex I to the Hong Kong Basic 
Law. That is, the committee shall be composed of members from 
four sectors in equal proportions, the delimitation of the various 
sectors, the organizations in each sector eligible to return members 
and the number of such members to be returned by each of these 
organizations shall be prescribed by the electoral law enacted by 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, and the committee 
members shall be elected by corporate bodies in various sectors on 
their own in accordance with the number of seats allocated and the 
election method as prescribed by law. The provision in the relevant 
Decision of the NPC Standing Committee on 29 December 2007 
that “the nominating committee may be formed with reference to 
the current provisions regarding the Election Committee in Annex I 
to the Hong Kong Basic Law”, indicates clearly the common theme 
between the nominating committee and the Election Committee as 
regards formation. Since there remains different understanding in the 
Hong Kong community on this issue, it is necessary to make further 
clarifications with a view to properly implementing the provisions of 
the Hong Kong Basic Law. 
Second, the method for forming the Election Committee to elect 
the Chief Executive was based on the consensus forged during the 
extensive consultations and discussions when drafting the Hong Kong 
Basic Law. Past elections for the Chief Executive since the return of 
Hong Kong have proven that the Election Committee has covered 
representative figures from all sectors of the Hong Kong community 
and achieved balanced participation of all sectors, and is therefore 
in conformity with the actual situation of Hong Kong. Composing 
the nominating committee in line with the formation of the current 
Election Committee meets the requirements of both the relevant 
provisions of the Hong Kong Basic Law and the objective need to 
ensure balanced participation and fend off various risks during 
election of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage. 
210 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Third, there are relatively more views in the Hong Kong 
community that the composition of the nominating committee should 
be decided with reference to the existing method for forming the 
Election Committee. There are considerable views that the number 
of members, composition and formation method of the nominating 
committee should be determined by following the existing provisions 
of the Election Committee. Bearing in mind that the provisions 
regarding the Election Committee for the fourth Chief Executive 
were made in 2010 alongside amendments to the method for selecting 
the Chief Executive and approved by the NPC Standing Committee, 
and that the total number of seats of the Election Committee was 
increased from 800 to 1,200, with such increase being made in 
equal proportions for all four sectors, and with the endorsement 
and support from all sides, it is relatively appropriate to provide for 
the nominating committee to have the same number of members, 
composition and formation method as the Election Committee. 
(2) On the number of Chief Executive candidates 
Paragraph (2) of Article II of the Draft Decision stipulates that 
“The nominating committee shall nominate two to three candidates 
for the office of Chief Executive in accordance with democratic 
procedures”. The major considerations with regard to this provision 
are: 
First, the stipulation to have two to three candidates for the office 
of the Chief Executive is made to ensure a truly competitive election 
and present voters with real choices. It could also serve to avoid 
problems such as complicated electoral procedures and high election 
costs caused by having too many candidates. 
Second, since the return of Hong Kong, almost all elections for 
the Chief Executive were conducted each with a candidacy of two to 
three. It fits relatively well with the experience gained from previous 
elections in Hong Kong to set the number of candidates at two to 
three. 
(3) On the need of a Chief Executive candidate to have the 
211 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
endorsement of more than half of the members of the nominating 
committee 
Paragraph (2) of Article II of the Draft Decision stipulates that 
“Each candidate must have the endorsement of more than half of all 
the members of the nominating committee”. The major considerations 
with regard to this provision are: 
First, the nominating committee as provided for by the Hong Kong 
Basic Law is a specialized institution for nomination. It collectively 
exercises the power to nominate Chief Executive candidates as 
an institution, and must therefore reflect the collective will of the 
institution. The “democratic procedures” stipulated in Paragraph 2 of 
Article 45 of the Hong Kong Basic Law should follow the democratic 
principle of majority rule so as to reflect the requirement that the 
nominating committee exercises power in a collective manner. Hence, 
it is appropriate to stipulate that a person contending for nomination 
as the Chief Executive candidate must obtain the support of more 
than half of the members of the nominating committee. 
Second, the nominating committee will comprise members from 
the four sectors in equal proportions. The stipulation that contenders 
for nomination as the Chief Executive candidates must obtain 
the support of more than half of the members of the nominating 
committee means that candidates need to obtain a certain extent of 
support from each sector of the nominating committee. This will help 
fulfill the principle of balanced participation and meet the interests of 
various sectors of the Hong Kong community. 
Third, the Report by the Chief Executive indicates considerable 
views of the Hong Kong community that a person contending for 
nomination as the Chief Executive candidate has to obtain support 
from a certain proportion of members of the nominating committee. 
Among the views heard by the General Office of the NPC Standing 
Committee, quite a number of people called for the proportion to be 
specified. Therefore, the further clarification that a person contending 
for nomination as the Chief Executive candidate must obtain the 
endorsement of more than half of the members of the nominating 
212 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
committee, is consistent with the provisions of the Hong Kong 
Basic Law, and will facilitate consensus building in the Hong Kong 
community. 
(4) On the method for voting in the election for the Chief Executive 
Article 26 of the Hong Kong Basic Law stipulates that “Permanent 
residents of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region shall have 
the right to vote and the right to stand for election in accordance with 
law”. On that basis, Paragraph (3) of Article II of the Draft Decision 
stipulates that “All eligible electors of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region have the right to vote in the election of the 
Chief Executive and elect one of the candidates for the office of Chief 
Executive in accordance with law”. According to this provision, each 
and every eligible elector shall have the right to directly participate 
in electing the Chief Executive. It fulfills the principle of universal 
and equal electoral right and marks a historic step forward in Hong 
Kong’s democratic development. 
(5) On appointment of the Chief Executive 
Paragraph 1 of Article 45 of the Hong Kong Basic Law provides 
that “The Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region shall be selected by election or through consultations held 
locally and be appointed by the Central People’s Government.” Based 
on this provision, Paragraph (4) of Article II of the Draft Decision 
stipulates that “The Chief Executive-elect, after being selected 
through universal suffrage, will have to be appointed by the Central 
People’s Government”. The central authorities, in formulating the 
basic policies with respect to Hong Kong and the Hong Kong Basic 
Law, already clearly pointed out that the power of the Central 
People’s Government to appoint the Chief Executive of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region is a substantive one. The Central 
People’s Government has the right to make the final decision on 
whether to appoint or not to appoint the Chief Executive returned by 
election held locally in Hong Kong. 
3. On proposing amendments to the method for selecting the Chief 
Executive 
213 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
 
The specific method for selecting the Chief Executive is stipulated 
in Annex I to the Hong Kong Basic Law. To amend the method for 
selecting the Chief Executive, a bill on amending the method for 
selecting the Chief Executive as well as relevant amendments to such 
bill shall be proposed by the Government of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region in accordance with the relevant Decisions of 
the NPC Standing Committee. Accordingly, Article III of the Draft 
Decision stipulates that “The specific method of universal suffrage 
for the Chief Executive shall be prescribed in accordance with legal 
procedures through amending Annex I to the Basic Law of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China: 
The Method for the Selection of the Chief Executive of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region. The bill on the amendments 
and the proposed amendments to such bill shall be introduced by 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government to the 
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
in accordance with the Hong Kong Basic Law and the provisions of 
this Decision. Such amendments shall obtain the endorsement of a 
two-thirds majority of all the members of the Legislative Council 
and the consent of the Chief Executive before being submitted to the 
Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress for approval.” 
4. On continued application of existing provisions relating to the 
method for selecting the Chief Executive if no amendment is made to 
the method 
Pursuant to the Interpretation made by the NPC Standing 
Committee in 2004, if no amendment is made to the method, existing 
provisions relating to the method for selecting the Chief Executive, 
the method for forming the Legislative Council and the procedures 
for voting on bills and motions will remain applicable. In 2007, 
the NPC Standing Committee reaffirmed the above position in its 
Decision on Issues Relating to the Methods for Selecting the Chief 
Executive and Forming the Legislative Council of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region in the Year 2012 and on Issues Relating 
to Universal Suffrage. In the premises, Article IV of the Draft Decision 
stipulates that “If the specific method of universal suffrage for 
selecting the Chief Executive is not adopted in accordance with legal 
214 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
procedures, the method used for selecting the Chief Executive for the 
preceding term shall continue to apply.” 
5. On the issue of amending the method for forming the Legislative 
Council in 2016 
As pointed out by the Report by the Chief Executive, the Hong 
Kong community generally agrees that efforts should now be focused 
on the proper handling of the election of the Chief Executive by 
universal suffrage; and that as relatively substantial amendments 
were made to the method for forming the Legislative Council in 2012, 
there is no need to amend Annex II to the Hong Kong Basic Law 
regarding the method for forming the Legislative Council in 2016. 
Upon deliberation, the members of the NPC Standing Committee 
are of the view that the amended method for forming the fifth term 
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
in 2012 already marked a major step towards greater democracy, and 
no amendment shall be made to the existing method for forming the 
Legislative Council and to the procedures for voting as prescribed in 
Annex II to the Hong Kong Basic Law, which is to say that the current 
formation method and procedures for voting will continue to apply to 
the sixth term Legislative Council in 2016. This is consistent with the 
principle of gradual and orderly progress in developing a democratic 
system that suits the actual situation of Hong Kong, in conformity 
with the majority view in the Hong Kong community, and conducive 
to the efforts of all sectors of the community to first focus on properly 
handling the selection of the Chief Executive by universal suffrage, 
and it will create conditions for the attainment of the aim of electing 
all members of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage after the 
implementation of universal suffrage for the selection of the Chief 
Executive. In accordance with the deliberations of the members of the 
NPC Standing Committee and the views of various sides, Article V of 
the Draft Decision stipulates that “The existing formation method and 
voting procedures for the Legislative Council as prescribed in Annex 
II to the Hong Kong Basic Law will not be amended. The formation 
method and procedures for voting on bills and motions of the fifth 
term Legislative Council will continue to apply to the sixth term 
Legislative Council of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
215 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
  
in 2016.” To reflect the consistent position of the central authorities 
to resolutely and firmly develop the democratic system in Hong Kong, 
and to push for the attainment of the aim of electing all the members 
of the Legislative Council by universal suffrage, this article further 
stipulates that “After the election of the Chief Executive by universal

* Interpretation of Article 104 of the Basic Law of the 
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
of the People’s Republic of China by the Standing Committee 
of the National People’s Congress 
(Adopted by the Standing Committee of the Twelfth National People’s 
Congress at its Twenty Fourth Session on 7 November 2016) 
The Standing Committee of the Twelfth National People’s Congress 
examined at its Twenty-fourth Session the motion regarding the request 
for examination of the Draft Interpretation of Article 104 of the Basic 
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s 
Republic of China submitted by the Council of Chairmen. Having 
consulted the Committee for the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region under the Standing Committee of the National 
People’s Congress, the Standing Committee of the National People’s 
Congress has decided to make, under the provisions of Article 67(4) of 
the Constitution of the People’s Republic of China and Article 158(1) of 
the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the 
People’s Republic of China, an interpretation of the provisions of Article 
104 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
of the People’s Republic of China regarding “When assuming office, the 
Chief Executive, principal officials, members of the Executive Council 
and of the Legislative Council, judges of the courts at all levels and other 
members of the judiciary in the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region must, in accordance with law, swear to uphold the Basic Law of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic 
of China and swear allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative 
Region of the People’s Republic of China” as follows: 
1. “To uphold the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China” and to bear 
“allegiance to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the 
People’s Republic of China” as stipulated in Article 104 of the Basic 
Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s 
Republic of China, are not only the legal content which must be included 
217 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
in the oath prescribed by the Article, but also the legal requirements and 
preconditions for standing for election in respect of or taking up the 
public office specified in the Article. 
2. The provisions in Article 104 of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong 
Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China that 
“When assuming office”, the relevant public officers “must, in accordance 
with law, swear” bear the following meaning: 
(1) Oath taking is the legal prerequisite and required procedure 
for public officers specified in the Article to assume office. No public 
office shall be assumed, no corresponding powers and functions shall be 
exercised, and no corresponding entitlements shall be enjoyed by anyone 
who fails to lawfully and validly take the oath or who declines to take the 
oath. 
(2) Oath taking must comply with the legal requirements in respect 
of its form and content. An oath taker must take the oath sincerely 
and solemnly, and must accurately, completely and solemnly read out 
the oath prescribed by law, the content of which includes “will uphold 
the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the 
People’s Republic of China, bear allegiance to the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China”. 
(3) An oath taker is disqualified forthwith from assuming the public 
office specified in the Article if he or she declines to take the oath. An 
oath taker who intentionally reads out words which do not accord with 
the wording of the oath prescribed by law, or takes the oath in a manner 
which is not sincere or not solemn, shall be treated as declining to take 
the oath. The oath so taken is invalid and the oath taker is disqualified 
forthwith from assuming the public office specified in the Article. 
(4) The oath must be taken before the person authorized by law to 
administer the oath. The person administering the oath has the duty 
to ensure that the oath is taken in a lawful manner. He or she shall 
determine that an oath taken in compliance with this Interpretation 
and the requirements under the laws of the Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region is valid, and that an oath which is not taken in 
218 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
  
compliance with this Interpretation and the requirements under the laws 
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is invalid. If the oath 
taken is determined as invalid, no arrangement shall be made for retaking 
the oath. 
3. The taking of the oath stipulated by Article 104 of the Basic Law 
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic 
of China is a legal pledge made by the public officers specified in the 
Article to the People’s Republic of China and its Hong Kong Special 
Administrative Region, and is legally binding. The oath taker must 
sincerely believe in and strictly abide by the relevant oath prescribed 
by law. An oath taker who makes a false oath, or, who, after taking 
the oath, engages in conduct in breach of the oath, shall bear legal 
responsibility in accordance with law. 
This Interpretation is hereby announced.

Instrument 30 
Explanations on the Draft Decision of the National People’s Congress 
on Improving the Electoral System of 
the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
(Adopted at the Fourth Session of the Thirteenth National People’s 
Congress on 5 March 2021) 
Wang Chen 
Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of 
The National People’s Congress 
Deputies, 
Entrusted by the Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress 
(NPC), I hereby make the following explanations about the Draft 
Decision of the National People’s Congress On Improving the Electoral 
System of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR). 
I. The imperative and importance of improving the electoral system of 
the Hong Kong SAR 
The return of Hong Kong to the motherland put the region once again 
under the overall governance system of the country. The Constitution 
of the People’s Republic of China and the Basic Law of the Hong 
Kong SAR of the People’s Republic of China jointly form the 
constitutional basis of the Hong Kong SAR. The electoral system of 
the Hong Kong SAR, which includes the methods for the selection of 
the Chief Executive and for the formation of the Legislative Council, 
is an important part of the political structure of the Hong Kong SAR. 
The electoral system should conform to the policy of “one country, 
two systems”, meet the realities in the Hong Kong SAR and serve to 
ensure “patriots administering Hong Kong”. It should be conducive to 
safeguarding China’s national sovereignty, security and development 
interests and help maintain the long-term prosperity and stability of 
Hong Kong. Since Hong Kong’s return, the State has all along fully and 
faithfully implemented the principles of “one country, two systems”, 
225 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
“Hong Kong people administering Hong Kong” and a high degree of 
autonomy, and has administered Hong Kong affairs according to law, 
upheld the constitutional order in the Hong Kong SAR as established 
by the Constitution and the Basic Law, supported the development 
of democracy in the Hong Kong SAR and guaranteed the exercise 
of democratic rights by Hong Kong residents in accordance with the 
law. However, it must be noted that in recent years, especially after the 
turbulence over the amendment bill in 2019, anti-China, destabilizing 
forces and radical localists in Hong Kong have openly called for “Hong 
Kong independence”. They used the electoral platforms of the Hong 
Kong SAR and the deliberation platforms of the Legislative Council and 
the District Councils or their position as public servants to blatantly carry 
out anti-China and destabilizing activities. They resorted to every possible 
means to paralyze the functioning of the Legislative Council and obstruct 
the law-based administration of the Hong Kong SAR government. They 
masterminded and perpetrated the so-called “primary election”, in an 
attempt to obtain a majority in the Legislative Council so that they could 
step further to grab the power to administer Hong Kong. Some foreign 
countries and external forces, by way of their own legislative bills or 
administrative means and through their consular agencies and NGOs in 
the Hong Kong SAR and other channels, blatantly meddled with Hong 
Kong affairs. They also grossly imposed so-called “sanctions” on the 
relevant Chinese personnel and flagrantly emboldened and covered those 
anti-China, destabilizing forces in Hong Kong. These activities seriously 
jeopardized the constitutional order and the order of rule of law in the 
Hong Kong SAR. They posed a grave challenge to the authority of the 
Constitution, the Basic Law and the Law of the People’s Republic of 
China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong SAR. Such 
activities put China’s national sovereignty, security and development 
interests into serious jeopardy and severely disrupted social stability of 
the Hong Kong SAR. They must be resolutely opposed, and forceful 
measures must be taken to prevent and defuse risks arising therefrom. 
The rioting and turbulence that occurred in the Hong Kong society 
reveals that the existing electoral system in the Hong Kong SAR has 
clear loopholes and deficiencies, which the anti-China, destabilizing 
elements jumped on to take into their hands the power to administer the 
Hong Kong SAR. To remedy the situation, necessary measures must be 
226 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
taken to improve the electoral system and remove existing institutional 
deficiencies and risks to ensure the administration of Hong Kong by 
Hong Kong people with patriots as the main body. This in turn will 
ensure effective and law-based administration in the Hong Kong SAR 
and keep the implementation of “one country, two systems” always on 
the right track. 
Back in June 1984, Mr. Deng Xiaoping pointed out that there must be 
“some requirements or qualifications with regard to the administration 
of Hong Kong affairs by the people of Hong Kong. It must be required 
that patriots form the main body of administrators”. According to him, 
“A patriot is one who respects the Chinese nation, sincerely supports the 
motherland’s resumption of exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong, 
and wishes not to impair Hong Kong’s prosperity and stability.” Hong 
Kong has been a Chinese territory since ancient times. The Hong Kong 
SAR is an inalienable part of the People’s Republic of China, a local 
administrative region with a high degree of autonomy that directly 
comes under the Central People’s Government. “Patriots administering 
Hong Kong” is a necessary requirement of the “one country, two 
systems” policy. All provisions in the Basic Law regarding Hong 
Kong’s Chief Executive and those working in the executive authorities, 
the legislature and the judiciary reflect the principle of “Hong Kong 
people administering Hong Kong” with patriots as the main body. It is 
stipulated that the Chief Executive, principal officials, members of the 
Executive Council and of the Legislative Council, judges of the courts 
at all levels and other members of the judiciary in the Hong Kong 
SAR must uphold the Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR and swear 
allegiance to the Hong Kong SAR of the People’s Republic of China. In 
a decision released in October 2019, the fourth plenary session of the 19th 
Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) called for 
upholding and improving the system and institutions of “one country, 
two systems”, improving the SAR’s institutions and mechanisms related 
to the implementation of the Constitution and the Basic Law, and 
upholding the “administration of Hong Kong by Hong Kong people” 
with patriots as the main body. On 27 January 2021, when listening 
to a 2020 work report from Chief Executive of the Hong Kong SAR, 
President Xi Jinping noted that Hong Kong’s major shift from chaos to 
stability has once again demonstrated the unfailing truth that to ensure 
227 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
the steady practice of “one country, two systems” in Hong Kong in the 
long run, the principle of “patriots administering Hong Kong” must be 
always upheld. This is a fundamental principle crucial to the sovereignty, 
security and development interests of our country and crucial to the 
sustained prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. Only when the principle 
of “patriots administering Hong Kong” is observed can the Central 
Authorities’ overall jurisdiction over the SAR be effectively implemented, 
the constitutional order as established by the Constitution and the Basic 
Law be effectively maintained, and the various deep-seated problems 
be effectively resolved. Only in this way can Hong Kong achieve 
durable stability and make its due contributions to realizing national 
rejuvenation. The electoral system of the Hong Kong SAR, including the 
methods for the selection of the Chief Executive and for the formation of 
the Legislative Council, must strictly follow and fully reflect the political 
principle and criterion of the “administration of Hong Kong by Hong 
Kong people” with patriots as the main body and provide institutional 
safeguards for this purpose. 
II. Overall requirements, important principles, basic approach, and the 
way to proceed for improving the electoral system of the Hong Kong 
SAR 
The overall requirements for improving the electoral system of the 
Hong Kong SAR are: following the guidance of Xi Jinping Thought on 
Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era; fully implementing 
the guiding principles of the CPC’s 19th National Congress and the 
second, third, fourth and fifth plenary sessions of its 19th Central 
Committee; upholding and improving the system and institutions of 
“one country, two systems”; fully implementing, reflecting and carrying 
out the principle of “patriots administering Hong Kong” with proper 
mechanisms and institutions; keeping the power to administer firmly 
in the hands of those who love the country and love Hong Kong; and 
ensuring Hong Kong’s long-term stability and prosperity. 
In implementing these overall requirements, it is imperative to 
observe the following important principles. First, fully and accurately 
implementing the principles of “one country, two systems”, “Hong 
Kong administer Hong Kong” and a high degree of autonomy. It is 
228 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
imperative to uphold and improve the system and institutions of “one 
country, two systems”, and ensure the administration of Hong Kong by 
Hong Kong people with patriots as the main body. It is imperative to 
integrate adherence to the principle of “One Country” with respect for 
the differences of “Two Systems”, and combine upholding the Central 
Authorities’ overall jurisdiction over the SAR with safeguarding a 
high degree of autonomy in the SAR, so as to provide well-established 
systemic guarantee for “patriots administering Hong Kong”. Second, 
firmly upholding sovereignty, security and development interests of the 
State. It is imperative to ensure that the State takes firm control over 
the improvement of the electoral system of the Hong Kong SAR, fully 
implement the Law on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong 
Kong SAR, maintain overall social stability of the Hong Kong SAR, and 
resolutely prevent, stop and punish interference in Hong Kong affairs 
by foreign countries and external forces and their use of Hong Kong to 
conduct acts of secession, subversion, infiltration and sabotage. Third, 
administering Hong Kong in accordance with the law. It is imperative 
to maintain the constitutional order of the Hong Kong SAR enshrined 
in the Constitution and the Basic Law, improve the relevant electoral 
system and related mechanisms on the track of the Constitution and 
the Basic Law, and organize relevant elections in strict compliance with 
the Basic Law, the Law on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong 
Kong SAR, relevant decisions of the NPC and its Standing Committee 
as well as local laws of Hong Kong, so as to improve the ability and 
competence of governance in accordance with the law. Fourth, acting 
in line with the actual circumstances of Hong Kong. It is imperative to 
develop a system of democratic elections that fits Hong Kong’s actual 
conditions and reflects the overall interests of the society. It is imperative 
to guarantee in accordance with the law the extensive and balanced 
political participation of the Hong Kong compatriots, and guarantee in 
accordance with the law the right to vote and the right to be elected which 
are lawfully enjoyed by Hong Kong permanent residents. It is imperative 
to unite all that can be united, and build extensive, positive energy in 
the Hong Kong society. Fifth, improving the governance efficacy of the 
Hong Kong SAR. It is imperative to improve the system under which the 
Chief Executive is responsible to the Central People’s Government, and 
maintain the executive-led governance structure and operational system 
of the Hong Kong SAR. It is imperative to support the Chief Executive, 
229 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the executive authorities, the legislature and the judiciary in exercising 
power and performing duty in accordance with the law, so as to ensure 
the smooth and efficient operation of the political and governance 
systems and mechanisms of the Hong Kong SAR. 
The overarching approach for improving the electoral system of the 
Hong Kong SAR is as follows: The overall design of the system will 
be centered around the reformation and greater empowerment of the 
Election Committee of the Hong Kong SAR. The size, composition 
and formation method of the Election Committee will be adjusted 
and improved. The Chief Executive will continue to be elected by the 
Election Committee. The Election Committee will be entrusted with 
the new function of electing a relatively large share of Legislative 
Council members and directly participating in the nomination of all 
candidates for the Legislative Council. Through the Election Committee, 
the balanced and orderly political participation will be expanded and 
broader representation ensured in the Hong Kong society. Relevant 
elements of the election will be adjusted as appropriate, and a mechanism 
of qualification review will be established throughout the entire process. 
This design is aimed to form a new democratic electoral system suited to 
Hong Kong’s realities and with Hong Kong characteristics. 
The existing electoral system in the Hong Kong SAR was established in 
accordance with relevant provisions of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong 
SAR, interpretations and decisions of the NPC Standing Committee, 
and relevant provisions of local laws in Hong Kong. Provisions of the 
Basic Law, including Articles 45 and 68, lay out the principles concerning 
the electoral system of the Hong Kong SAR, and Annex I and Annex 
II to the Basic Law as well as relevant amendments make specific and 
express stipulations. Based on comprehensive analysis and assessment, 
Central and State Authorities deem it necessary to revise and improve 
the electoral system of the Hong Kong SAR at the state level, mainly 
includes revising the method for the selection of the Chief Executive of 
the Hong Kong SAR and the method for the formation of the Legislative 
Council of the Hong Kong SAR. At the same time, in order to maintain 
continuity and stability of relevant systems of the Hong Kong SAR, the 
revisions to be made this time in improving the electoral system of the 
Hong Kong SAR may be limited to Annex I and Annex II to the Basic 
230 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
Law, without revising the main body of the Basic Law. After serious 
consideration of various factors and discussions with relevant parties, 
central and state authorities propose a two-step approach, namely, 
“decision plus amendment”. In the first step, the NPC, in accordance 
with the relevant provisions of the Constitution, the Basic Law, and 
the Law on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong SAR, 
makes the decision on improving the electoral system of the Hong Kong 
SAR, which lays out the basic principles for revising and improving the 
electoral system of the Hong Kong SAR as well as the core elements 
of such revision and improvement. Meanwhile, the NPC authorizes its 
Standing Committee to amend Annex I and Annex II to the Basic Law in 
accordance with the decision. In the second step, in accordance with the 
Constitution, the Basic Law, the Law on Safeguarding National Security 
in the Hong Kong SAR, and the NPC decision, the NPC Standing 
Committee amends Annex I: Method for the Selection of the Chief 
Executive of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and Annex 
II: Method for the Formation of the Legislative Council of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region and Its Voting Procedures of the 
Basic Law of the Hong Kong SAR. The amended Annex I and Annex 
II will contain specific and express provisions on the new democratic 
electoral system of the Hong Kong SAR. After the amendment of Annex 
I and Annex II at the state level is completed, the Hong Kong SAR will 
amend relevant local laws accordingly. 
At its 26th session on 27 and 28 February 2021, the Standing Committee 
of the 13th NPC heard and deliberated on the Report of the State 
Council on Revising and Improving the Electoral System of the Hong 
Kong Special Administrative Region and Relevant Recommendations. 
It endorsed the Report’s recommendations on revising and improving 
the electoral system of the Hong Kong SAR. On this basis, in accordance 
with relevant provisions of the Constitution, the Basic Law of the Hong 
Kong SAR, and the Law on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong 
Kong SAR as well as relevant decisions of the NPC and its Standing 
Committee, and in light of the actual conditions in the Hong Kong SAR, 
the Legislative Affairs Commission of the NPC Standing Committee drew 
up the Draft Decision of the National People’s Congress on Improving 
the Electoral System of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, 
which, after deliberation by the NPC Standing Committee, has been 
231 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
 
submitted to the Fourth Session of the 13th NPC for deliberation. 
III. Overview of the Draft Decision 
The Draft Decision of the National People’s Congress on Improving 
the Electoral System of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region 
consists of an introduction and the main body. The introduction briefly 
explains the purposes and legal basis of the Decision. The relevant 
decision to be taken by the NPC is based on Article 31 and sub-
paragraphs 2, 14 and 16 of Article 62 of the Constitution of the People’s 
Republic of China and relevant provisions of the Basic Law of the Hong 
Kong SAR of the People’s Republic of China and the Law of the People’s 
Republic of China on Safeguarding National Security in the Hong Kong 
SAR. It takes into full consideration the practical need for improving 
the relevant electoral system of the Hong Kong SAR and of the reality 
in the Hong Kong SAR. It will make a new constitutional arrangement 
for a set of institutions to improve the electoral system of the Hong Kong 
SAR and advance the democratic political system that fits Hong Kong’s 
actual conditions. Such an institutional arrangement is in line with the 
stipulations and principles of the Constitution and the Basic Law of the 
Hong Kong SAR, and holds solid political and legal ground. It will help 
ensure that patriots form the main body of administrators in Hong Kong, 
and guarantee the sound and sustained implementation of “one country, 
two systems” in Hong Kong. 
The main body of the Draft Decision lays out the basic principles for 
revising and improving the electoral system of the Hong Kong SAR as 
well as the core elements of such revision and improvement. At the same 
time, it authorizes the NPC Standing Committee to amend Annex I and 
Annex II to the Basic Law in accordance with this Decision. During 
deliberations on revising and improving the electoral system of the Hong 
Kong SAR, central and state authorities have thought through issues 
related to making this Decision and then amending Annex I and Annex II 
to the Basic Law, and have made arrangements accordingly. After the 
adoption of this Decision by the NPC, the NPC Standing Committee 
will work, pursuant to this Decision and in coordination with other 
competent authorities, to promptly launch the procedure of amending 
Annex I and Annex II to the Basic Law. Upon the promulgation and 
232 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
  
entry into force of the amended Annex I and Annex II to the Basic Law, 
the previous Annex I, Annex II and their amendments will be repealed 
simultaneously. 
The Draft Decision of the National People’s Congress on Improving the 
Electoral System of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and 
the above Explanations are now submitted for deliberation.

(Adopted at the Fourth Session of the Thirteenth National People’s Congress 
on 11 March 2021)

(NPC) deliberated the motion regarding the request for examination of 
the “Draft Decision of the National People’s Congress On Improving 
the Electoral System of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region”

selection of the Chief Executive and for the formation of the Legislative 
Council (LegCo), is an important part of the political structure of

systems”, meet the realities in the HKSAR and serve to ensure that 
Hong Kong is administered by people who love the country and Hong 
Kong; be conducive to safeguarding national sovereignty, security, 
and development interests of the country and maintain the long-term 
prosperity and stability of Hong Kong. To improve the electoral system 
of the HKSAR and develop a democratic system suited to the HKSAR’s 
realities, the NPC has made the following decision pursuant to Articles 31
