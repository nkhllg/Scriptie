Provided that no such order shall be made unless the Tribunal
is satisfied having regard to all the circumstances of the case,

identity of any such sub-tenant, the Tribunal may, on an
ex  parte  application  by  the  landlord,  make  an  order
calling upon any sub-tenant to give notice to the landlord
of his interest in the premises and may give directions
regarding the service of that order.
(b)
Where any sub-tenant fails, within the period specified in
the order mentioned in paragraph (a), to give notice to

may,  when  it  makes  an  order  for  possession  of  the

as no sufficient distress can be had to countervail the arrears of
rent, the court may, on the application of the lessor or landlord
or his agent and on information upon oath, issue its warrant
authorizing any bailiff to enter on the premises, breaking any
doors, windows, or gates, if necessary; and, if the premises are
found to be deserted with no sufficient distress therein, to
place the same in charge of a bailiff and to affix a notice
thereon,  in  a  conspicuous  place,  that, unless  cause  to  the
contrary  is  shown  before  the  court  within  10  days,  the

a warrant, make an order directing a bailiff to put the applicant

shall  the  party  distraining  be  deemed  a  trespasser  from  the

Determining the nature of a tenancy
(1)
Notwithstanding the purpose for which premises were let, in
determining the nature of a tenancy for the purposes of this
Part the following provisions shall apply‚Äî
(a)
in  any  agreement  in  writing  between  a  landlord  and

premises are being used for such purpose;

were originally let as a dwelling or not let as a dwelling,
premises  which  are  being  used  primarily for  another
purpose shall be deemed to have been let for such other
purpose;  but  where  such  primary  user  is  user  as  a

such user has been agreed to by the landlord, expressly
or by implication, or acquiesced in by him;

evidence as to whether premises were let as a dwelling or

where there is evidence that premises were let otherwise
than  as  a  dwelling,  or  that  they  were  being  used

premises  the  subject  of  such  sub-tenancy  shall
themselves be deemed to be used otherwise than as a
dwelling until the sub-tenant satisfies the Tribunal to the
contrary;
(e)
the use of premises as a boarding or lodging house is a
use other than as a dwelling.

In determining whether premises were let, or are being used,
as a dwelling, the following may be taken into account‚Äî
(a)
the covenants, terms and conditions in any Government
lease or tenancy; (Amended 29 of 1998 s. 105)
(b)
any occupation permit given by the Building Authority
under section 21 of the Buildings Ordinance (Cap. 123),
