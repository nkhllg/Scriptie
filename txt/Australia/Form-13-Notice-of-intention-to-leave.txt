As the tenant/s, you give this notice to the property owner/manager when wanting to vacate the premises by a certain date.
There may be several grounds (reasons) for giving the notice. If the property owner/manager disputes these reasons, they should try to resolve 
the matter with you first. If agreement cannot be reached, the RTA’s dispute resolution service may be able to help – visit rta.qld.gov.au or 
phone 1300 366 311.
If you are leaving because of an unremedied breach, this notice can only be given after the 7-day remedy period has expired.
If you are giving this notice because of an unremedied breach by the owner or manager, please note that this notice does not guarantee 
that you will be released from the tenancy agreement. You may apply for termination of your lease through the Queensland Civil and 
Administrative Tribunal (QCAT) under section 309 of the Residential Tenancies and Rooming Accommodation Act 2008.
When serving notices by post, you must allow time for the mail to arrive when working out notice periods.
Minimum notice periods 
Note: When you calculate dates for notices, where the notice period is in days, weeks or months, you must not count the day the notice is 
given. If the time period allowed under the legislation for a party to do anything ends on a weekend or public holiday, then the end of the 
time period will be on the next business day.
