under this Act.
154C
Scheme for recording strikes against tenant for breaches
(1) If a landlord under a social housing tenancy agreement is satisfied that a tenant has
breached the agreement but is not satisfied that the circumstances of the breach
taken alone justify termination of the agreement, the landlord may issue a strike
notice to the tenant and record a strike against the tenant.
(2) A strike notice—
(a) must be in writing, and
(b) must inform the tenant that a strike has been recorded against the tenant, and
(c) must set out details of the alleged breach of the agreement for which the strike
has been recorded, and
(d) must remind the tenant of any strikes that have been recorded (and not
withdrawn) against the tenant within the previous 12 months (including strikes
recorded for breach of a prior social housing tenancy agreement with the same or,
to the extent that relevant information is known by the landlord, a different
landlord), and
(e) must warn the tenant that, if a third strike is recorded against the tenant within 12
months, a termination notice may be given to the tenant, and
(f) must inform the tenant that, if the tenant disagrees with the statement of details
of the alleged breach of the agreement for which the strike has been recorded, or
any aspect of those details, the tenant should make submissions to the landlord
setting out the grounds of the disagreement, and
(g) must specify how the submissions may be made and the date before which they
must be made (being a date not less than 21 days after the date of the strike
notice), and
(h) must inform the tenant that, if the tenant does not make any such submissions,
the details of the alleged breach of the agreement set out in the strike notice will
be taken, in proceedings before the Tribunal, to have been conclusively proved
and the tenant will not be able to challenge the accuracy of those details.
(3) A landlord may withdraw a strike against a tenant at any time.
(4) If, after considering submissions made by a tenant as set out in a strike notice, the
landlord decides not to withdraw the strike, the landlord must give the tenant a notice
in writing—

Current version for 13 December 2024 to date (accessed 27 April 2025 at 22:26)

(a) informing the tenant of that decision and that the tenant may apply for review of
the strike notice, and
(b) specifying how the application may be made and the date before which it must be
made (being a date not less than 21 days after the date of the notice).
(5) If an application for review of a strike notice is made by a tenant, the landlord must
refer the matter to a review panel comprised of one or more persons who were not
substantially involved in the process of making the decision under review and who
are, in the opinion of the landlord, otherwise suitably qualified to deal with the issues
raised by the application.
(6) On a review, the review panel must consider any information submitted by the tenant
and may—
(a) confirm the strike against the tenant, or
(b) require the strike against the tenant to be withdrawn.
(7) A landlord is bound by a decision of a review panel requiring a strike against a tenant
to be withdrawn.
(8) A landlord must, on application by a tenant, provide the tenant with information about
any strikes recorded (and not withdrawn) against the tenant (unless that information
has already been provided to the tenant within the last 3 months and no further
strikes have been recorded against the tenant since the information was last
provided).
(9) If 2 strikes have been recorded against the tenant within the previous 12 months and
the landlord is satisfied that the tenant has breached the social housing tenancy
agreement and that a further strike notice could be issued to the tenant, the landlord
may—
(a) record a strike against the tenant without issuing a further strike notice, and
(b) give a termination notice under section 87 on the basis that the landlord is
satisfied that a series of breaches by the tenant of the agreement or any prior
social housing tenancy agreement with the same or a different landlord justifies
termination of the agreement with the tenant.
(10) The termination notice—
(a) must inform the tenant that a strike has been recorded against the tenant and set
out details of the alleged breach of the agreement for which the strike has been
recorded, and

harm within the meaning of the Crimes Act 1900, or
(b) an application for the order is made under section 91 and the Tribunal is satisfied
of the matters set out in section 91(1)(a), or
(c) an application for the order is made under section 91 and the Tribunal is satisfied
that the tenant, or any person who although not a tenant is occupying or jointly
occupying the social housing premises, has intentionally or recklessly caused or
permitted the social housing premises or any property adjoining or adjacent to the
premises (including any property that is available for use by the tenant in common
with others) to be used for the purposes of—
(i) storing a firearm for which a licence or permit is not held under the Firearms
Act 1996, or
(ii) a show cause offence within the meaning of the Bail Act 2013,
and the tenant or other person has been charged with an offence relating to those
circumstances (whether or not the person is or has been found guilty of the
offence).
(2) Subject to subsection (3), the Tribunal must make a termination order on the
application of a landlord if—
(a) an application for the order is made under section 90 and the Tribunal is satisfied
of the matters set out in section 90(1) (and subsection (1) of this section does not
apply), or

occupying the social housing premises, has intentionally or recklessly caused or

(iii) for the purposes of an offence against section 154G (Facilitating organised car
or boat rebirthing activities) of the Crimes Act 1900, or

that the tenant, or any person who although not a tenant is occupying or jointly
occupying the social housing premises, has intentionally or recklessly caused or
permitted the social housing premises or any property adjoining or adjacent to the
premises (including any property that is available for use by the tenant in common
with others) to be used for any other unlawful purpose and that the use is
sufficient to justify the termination.

or (2)(b) has been committed by a person on the social housing premises or any

available for use by the tenant in common with others), the Tribunal must assume
that—
(i) the premises or property has been used for an unlawful purpose, and
(ii) the use is sufficient to justify termination of the agreement.
(5) If the Tribunal does not make a termination order as a consequence of subsection (3),
the Tribunal must provide written reasons for the decision.
