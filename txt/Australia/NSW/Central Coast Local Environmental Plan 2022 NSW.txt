Zone objectives and Land Use Table
(1) The Land Use Table at the end of this Part specifies for each zone—
(a) the objectives for development, and
(b) development that may be carried out without development consent, and
Central Coast Local Environmental Plan 2022 [NSW]
Current version for 6 September 2024 to date (accessed 8 April 2025 at 19:30)
Page 12 of 193

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(c) development that may be carried out only with development consent, and
(d) development that is prohibited.
(2) The consent authority must have regard to the objectives for development in a zone
when determining a development application in respect of land within the zone.
(3) In the Land Use Table at the end of this Part—
(a) a reference to a type of building or other thing is a reference to development for
the purposes of that type of building or other thing, and
(b) a reference to a type of building or other thing does not include (despite any
definition in this Plan) a reference to a type of building or other thing referred to
separately in the Land Use Table in relation to the same zone.
(4) This clause is subject to the other provisions of this Plan.
Notes—
1
Schedule 1 sets out additional permitted uses for particular land.
2
Schedule 2 sets out exempt development (which is generally exempt from both Parts 4 and 5 of the Act).
Development in the land use table that may be carried out without consent is nevertheless subject to the
environmental assessment and approval requirements of Part 5 of the Act.
3
Schedule 3 sets out complying development (for which a complying development certificate may be issued as
an alternative to obtaining development consent).
4
Clause 2.6 requires consent for subdivision of land.
5
Part 5 contains other provisions which require consent for particular development.
2.4
Unzoned land
(1) Development may be carried out on unzoned land only with development consent.
(2) In deciding whether to grant development consent, the consent authority—
(a) must consider whether the development will impact on adjoining zoned land and,
if so, consider the objectives for development in the zones of the adjoining land,
and
(b) must be satisfied that the development is appropriate and is compatible with
permissible land uses in any such adjoining land.
2.5
Additional permitted uses for particular land
(1) Development on particular land that is described or referred to in Schedule 1 may be
carried out—
(a) with development consent, or
(b) if the Schedule so provides—without development consent,
in accordance with the conditions (if any) specified in that Schedule in relation to that

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
development.
(2) This clause has effect despite anything to the contrary in the Land Use Table or other
provision of this Plan.
2.6
Subdivision—consent requirements
(1) Land to which this Plan applies may be subdivided, but only with development
consent.
Notes—
1
If a subdivision is specified as exempt development in an applicable environmental planning
instrument, such as this Plan or State Environmental Planning Policy (Exempt and Complying Development
Codes) 2008, the Act enables it to be carried out without development consent.
2
Part 6 of State Environmental Planning Policy (Exempt and Complying Development Codes) 2008
provides that the strata subdivision of a building in certain circumstances is complying development.
(2) Development consent must not be granted for the subdivision of land on which a
secondary dwelling is situated if the subdivision would result in the principal dwelling
and the secondary dwelling being situated on separate lots, unless the resulting lots
are not less than the minimum size shown on the Lot Size Map in relation to that land.
Note—
The definition of secondary dwelling in the Dictionary requires the dwelling to be on the same lot of land
as the principal dwelling.
2.7
Demolition requires development consent
The demolition of a building or work may be carried out only with development consent.
Note—
If the demolition of a building or work is identified in an applicable environmental planning instrument, such as
this Plan or State Environmental Planning Policy (Exempt and Complying Development Codes) 2008, as exempt
development, the Act enables it to be carried out without development consent.
2.8
Temporary use of land
(1) The objective of this clause is to provide for the temporary use of land if the use does
not compromise future development of the land, or have detrimental economic, social,
amenity or environmental effects on the land.
(2) Despite any other provision of this Plan, development consent may be granted for
development on land in any zone for a temporary use for a maximum period of 28
days (whether or not consecutive days) in any period of 12 months.
(3) Development consent must not be granted unless the consent authority is satisfied
that—
(a) the temporary use will not prejudice the subsequent carrying out of development
on the land in accordance with this Plan and any other applicable environmental
planning instrument, and

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b) the temporary use will not adversely impact on any adjoining land or the amenity
of the neighbourhood, and
(c) the temporary use and location of any structures related to the use will not
adversely impact on environmental attributes or features of the land, or increase
the risk of natural hazards that may affect the land, and
(d) at the end of the temporary use period the land will, as far as is practicable, be
restored to the condition in which it was before the commencement of the use.
(4) Despite subclause (2), the temporary use of a dwelling as a sales office for a new
release area or a new housing estate may exceed the maximum number of days
specified in that subclause.
(5) Subclause (3)(d) does not apply to the temporary use of a dwelling as a sales office
mentioned in subclause (4).
2.9
Canal estate development prohibited
(1) Canal estate development is prohibited on land to which this Plan applies.
(2) In this Plan, canal estate development means development that involves—
(a) a constructed canal, or other waterway or waterbody, that—
(i) is inundated by surface water or groundwater movement, or
(ii) drains to a waterway or waterbody by surface water or groundwater
movement, and
(b) the erection of a dwelling, and
(c) one or both of the following—
(i) the use of fill material to raise the level of all or part of the land on which the
dwelling will be erected to comply with requirements for residential
development in the flood planning area,
(ii) excavation to create a waterway.
(3) Canal estate development does not include development for the purposes of drainage
or the supply or treatment of water if the development is—
(a) carried out by or with the authority of a person or body responsible for the
drainage, supply or treatment, and
(b) limited to the minimum reasonable size and capacity.
(4) In this clause—

Calculation of floor space ratio and site area
(1) Objectives The objectives of this clause are as follows—
(a) to define floor space ratio,
(b) to set out rules for the calculation of the site area of development for the purpose
of applying permitted floor space ratios, including rules to—
(i) prevent the inclusion in the site area of an area that has no significant
development being carried out on it, and
(ii) prevent the inclusion in the site area of an area that has already been included
as part of a site area to maximise floor space area in another building, and
(iii) require community land and public places to be dealt with separately.
(2) Definition of “floor space ratio” The floor space ratio of buildings on a site is the ratio
of the gross floor area of all buildings within the site to the site area.
(3) Site area In determining the site area of proposed development for the purpose of
applying a floor space ratio, the site area is taken to be—
(a) if the proposed development is to be carried out on only one lot, the area of that
lot, or
(b) if the proposed development is to be carried out on 2 or more lots, the area of any
lot on which the development is proposed to be carried out that has at least one
common boundary with another lot on which the development is being carried out.
In addition, subclauses (4)–(7) apply to the calculation of site area for the purposes of
applying a floor space ratio to proposed development.
(4) Exclusions from site area The following land must be excluded from the site area—
(a) land on which the proposed development is prohibited, whether under this Plan or
any other law,
(b) community land or a public place (except as provided by subclause (7)).
Central Coast Local Environmental Plan 2022 [NSW]
Current version for 6 September 2024 to date (accessed 8 April 2025 at 19:30)
Page 61 of 193

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(5) Strata subdivisions The area of a lot that is wholly or partly on top of another or others
in a strata subdivision is to be included in the calculation of the site area only to the
extent that it does not overlap with another lot already included in the site area
calculation.
(6) Only significant development to be included The site area for proposed development
must not include a lot additional to a lot or lots on which the development is being
carried out unless the proposed development includes significant development on that
additional lot.
(7) Certain public land to be separately considered For the purpose of applying a floor space
ratio to any proposed development on, above or below community land or a public
place, the site area must only include an area that is on, above or below that
community land or public place, and is occupied or physically affected by the
proposed development, and may not include any other area on which the proposed
development is to be carried out.
(8) Existing buildings The gross floor area of any existing or proposed buildings within the
vertical projection (above or below ground) of the boundaries of a site is to be
included in the calculation of the total floor space for the purposes of applying a floor
space ratio, whether or not the proposed development relates to all of the buildings.
(9) Covenants to prevent “double dipping” When development consent is granted to
development on a site comprised of 2 or more lots, a condition of the consent may
require a covenant to be registered that prevents the creation of floor area on a lot
(the restricted lot) if the consent authority is satisfied that an equivalent quantity of
floor area will be created on another lot only because the site included the restricted
lot.
(10) Covenants affect consolidated sites If—
(a) a covenant of the kind referred to in subclause (9) applies to any land (affected
land), and
(b) proposed development relates to the affected land and other land that together
comprise the site of the proposed development,
the maximum amount of floor area allowed on the other land by the floor space ratio
fixed for the site by this Plan is reduced by the quantity of floor space area the
covenant prevents being created on the affected land.
(11) Definition In this clause, public place has the same meaning as it has in the Local
Government Act 1993.

5.2
Classification and reclassification of public land
(1) The objective of this clause is to enable the Council to classify or reclassify public land
as “operational land” or “community land” in accordance with Part 2 of Chapter 6 of
the Local Government Act 1993.
Note—
Under the Local Government Act 1993, “public land” is generally land vested in or under the control of a
council (other than roads and certain Crown land). The classification or reclassification of public land may
also be made by a resolution of the Council under section 31, 32 or 33 of the Local Government Act 1993.
Section 30 of that Act enables this Plan to discharge trusts on which public reserves are held if the land is
reclassified under this Plan as operational land.
(2) The public land described in Part 1 or Part 2 of Schedule 4 is classified, or reclassified,
as operational land for the purposes of the Local Government Act 1993.
(3) The public land described in Part 3 of Schedule 4 is classified, or reclassified, as
community land for the purposes of the Local Government Act 1993.
(4) The public land described in Part 1 of Schedule 4—
(a) does not cease to be a public reserve to the extent (if any) that it is a public
reserve, and
(b) continues to be affected by any trusts, estates, interests, dedications, conditions,
restrictions or covenants that affected the land before its classification, or
reclassification, as operational land.
(5) The public land described in Part 2 of Schedule 4, to the extent (if any) that it is a
public reserve, ceases to be a public reserve when the description of the land is
inserted into that Part and is discharged from all trusts, estates, interests, dedications,
conditions, restrictions and covenants affecting the land or any part of the land,
except—
(a) those (if any) specified for the land in Column 3 of Part 2 of Schedule 4, and
(b) any reservations that except land out of the Crown grant relating to the land, and
(c) reservations of minerals (within the meaning of the Crown Land Management Act

subclause (5) applying to the public land concerned is required before the description of the land is inserted
in Part 2 of Schedule 4.
5.3
Development near zone boundaries
(1) The objective of this clause is to provide flexibility where the investigation of a site
and its surroundings reveals that a use allowed on the other side of a zone boundary
would enable a more logical and appropriate development of the site and be
compatible with the planning objectives and land uses for the adjoining zone.
(2) This clause applies to so much of any land that is within the relevant distance of a
boundary between any 2 zones. The relevant distance is 20m.
(3) This clause does not apply to—
(a) land in Zone RE1 Public Recreation, Zone C1 National Parks and Nature Reserves,
Zone C2 Environmental Conservation, Zone C3 Environmental Management or
Zone W1 Natural Waterways, or
(b) land within the coastal zone, or
(c) land proposed to be developed for the purpose of sex services or restricted
premises.
(4) Despite the provisions of this Plan relating to the purposes for which development
may be carried out, development consent may be granted to development of land to
which this clause applies for any purpose that may be carried out in the adjoining
zone, but only if the consent authority is satisfied that—
(a) the development is not inconsistent with the objectives for development in both
zones, and
(b) the carrying out of the development is desirable due to compatible land use
planning, infrastructure capacity and other planning principles relating to the
efficient and timely development of land.
(5) This clause does not prescribe a development standard that may be varied under this
Plan.
