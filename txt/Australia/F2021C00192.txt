Australian Accounting Standard AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement (as amended) is set 
out in paragraphs AusCF1 – Aus110.2 and Appendix A.  All the paragraphs have equal authority.  Paragraphs in bold 
type state the main principles.  AASB 139 is to be read in the context of other Australian Accounting Standards, 
including AASB 1048 Interpretation of Standards, which identifies the Australian Accounting Interpretations, and 
AASB 1057 Application of Australian Accounting Standards.  In the absence of explicit guidance, AASB 108 
Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors provides a basis for selecting and applying 
accounting policies.

COMPARISON 
Comparison with IAS 39 
AASB 139 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement as amended incorporates IAS 39 Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement as issued and amended by the International Accounting Standards Board 
(IASB).  Australian-specific paragraphs (which are not included in IAS 39) are identified with the prefix “Aus”.  
Paragraphs that apply only to not-for-profit entities begin by identifying their limited applicability. 
Tier 1 
For-profit entities complying with AASB 139 also comply with IAS 39. 
Not-for-profit entities’ compliance with IAS 39 will depend on whether any “Aus” paragraphs that specifically apply 
to not-for-profit entities provide additional guidance or contain applicable requirements that are inconsistent with 
IAS 39. 
AASB 1053 Application of Tiers of Australian Accounting Standards explains the two tiers of reporting requirements.

STANDARD

The following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings specified: 
Definitions relating to hedge accounting 
 
A firm commitment is a binding agreement for the exchange of a specified quantity of resources at a 
specified price on a specified future date or dates.  
 
A forecast transaction is an uncommitted but anticipated future transaction.  
 
A hedging instrument is a designated derivative or (for a hedge of the risk of changes in foreign 
currency exchange rates only) a designated non-derivative financial asset or non-derivative financial 
liability whose fair value or cash flows are expected to offset changes in the fair value or cash flows of 
a designated hedged item (paragraphs 72–77 and Appendix A paragraphs AG94–AG97 elaborate on 
the definition of a hedging instrument).  
 
A hedged item is an asset, liability, firm commitment, highly probable forecast transaction or net 
investment in a foreign operation that (a) exposes the entity to risk of changes in fair value or future 
cash flows and (b) is designated as being hedged (paragraphs 78–84 and Appendix A paragraphs 
AG98–AG101 elaborate on the definition of hedged items).  
 
Hedge effectiveness is the degree to which changes in the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item 
that are attributable to a hedged risk are offset by changes in the fair value or cash flows of the 
hedging instrument (see Appendix A paragraphs AG105–AG113A).  
10– 
70 
[Deleted] 
Hedging 
71 
If an entity applies AASB 9 and has not chosen as its accounting policy to continue to apply the hedge 
accounting requirements of this Standard (see paragraph 7.2.21 of AASB 9), it shall apply the hedge 
accounting requirements in Chapter 6 of AASB 9. However, for a fair value hedge of the interest rate 
exposure of a portion of a portfolio of financial assets or financial liabilities, an entity may, in 
accordance with paragraph 6.1.3 of AASB 9, apply the hedge accounting requirements in this 
Standard instead of those in AASB 9. In that case the entity must also apply the specific requirements 
for fair value hedge accounting for a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk (see paragraphs 81A, 89A 
and AG114–AG132).  
Hedging instruments 
Qualifying instruments 
72 
This Standard does not restrict the circumstances in which a derivative may be designated as a hedging 
instrument provided the conditions in paragraph 88 are met, except for some written options (see Appendix 
A paragraph AG94). However, a non-derivative financial asset or non-derivative financial liability may be 
designated as a hedging instrument only for a hedge of a foreign currency risk. 
73 
For hedge accounting purposes, only instruments that involve a party external to the reporting entity (ie 
external to the group or individual entity that is being reported on) can be designated as hedging 
instruments. Although individual entities within a consolidated group or divisions within an entity may 
enter into hedging transactions with other entities within the group or divisions within the entity, any such 
intragroup transactions are eliminated on consolidation. Therefore, such hedging transactions do not qualify 
for hedge accounting in the consolidated financial statements of the group. However, they may qualify for 
hedge accounting in the individual or separate financial statements of individual entities within the group 
provided that they are external to the individual entity that is being reported on. 
Designation of hedging instruments 
74 
There is normally a single fair value measure for a hedging instrument in its entirety, and the factors that 
cause changes in fair value are co-dependent. Thus, a hedging relationship is designated by an entity for a 
hedging instrument in its entirety. The only exceptions permitted are:  
(a) 
separating the intrinsic value and time value of an option contract and designating as the hedging 
instrument only the change in intrinsic value of an option and excluding change in its time value; 
and 
Authorised Version F2021C00192 registered 05/03/2021

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
AASB 139-compiled 
7 
STANDARD 
(b) 
separating the interest element and the spot price of a forward contract. 
These exceptions are permitted because the intrinsic value of the option and the premium on the forward 
can generally be measured separately. A dynamic hedging strategy that assesses both the intrinsic value and 
time value of an option contract can qualify for hedge accounting. 
75 
A proportion of the entire hedging instrument, such as 50 per cent of the notional amount, may be 
designated as the hedging instrument in a hedging relationship. However, a hedging relationship may not be 
designated for only a portion of the time period during which a hedging instrument remains outstanding.  
76 
A single hedging instrument may be designated as a hedge of more than one type of risk provided that (a) 
the risks hedged can be identified clearly; (b) the effectiveness of the hedge can be demonstrated; and (c) it 
is possible to ensure that there is specific designation of the hedging instrument and different risk positions. 
77 
Two or more derivatives, or proportions of them (or, in the case of a hedge of currency risk, two or more 
non-derivatives or proportions of them, or a combination of derivatives and non-derivatives or proportions 
of them), may be viewed in combination and jointly designated as the hedging instrument, including when 
the risk(s) arising from some derivatives offset(s) those arising from others. However, an interest rate collar 
or other derivative instrument that combines a written option and a purchased option does not qualify as a 
hedging instrument if it is, in effect, a net written option (for which a net premium is received). Similarly, 
two or more instruments (or proportions of them) may be designated as the hedging instrument only if none 
of them is a written option or a net written option. 
Hedged items 
Qualifying items 
78 
A hedged item can be a recognised asset or liability, an unrecognised firm commitment, a highly probable 
forecast transaction or a net investment in a foreign operation. The hedged item can be (a) a single asset, 
liability, firm commitment, highly probable forecast transaction or net investment in a foreign operation, (b) 
a group of assets, liabilities, firm commitments, highly probable forecast transactions or net investments in 
foreign operations with similar risk characteristics or (c) in a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk only, a 
portion of the portfolio of financial assets or financial liabilities that share the risk being hedged. 
79 
[Deleted] 
80 
For hedge accounting purposes, only assets, liabilities, firm commitments or highly probable forecast 
transactions that involve a party external to the entity can be designated as hedged items. It follows that 
hedge accounting can be applied to transactions between entities in the same group only in the individual or 
separate financial statements of those entities and not in the consolidated financial statements of the group, 
except for the consolidated financial statements of an investment entity, as defined in AASB 10, where 
transactions between an investment entity and its subsidiaries measured at fair value through profit or loss 
will not be eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. As an exception, the foreign currency risk of 
an intragroup monetary item (eg a payable/receivable between two subsidiaries) may qualify as a hedged 
item in the consolidated financial statements if it results in an exposure to foreign exchange rate gains or 
losses that are not fully eliminated on consolidation in accordance with AASB 121 The Effects of Changes 
in Foreign Exchange Rates. In accordance with AASB 121, foreign exchange rate gains and losses on 
intragroup monetary items are not fully eliminated on consolidation when the intragroup monetary item is 
transacted between two group entities that have different functional currencies. In addition, the foreign 
currency risk of a highly probable forecast intragroup transaction may qualify as a hedged item in 
consolidated financial statements provided that the transaction is denominated in a currency other than the 
functional currency of the entity entering into that transaction and the foreign currency risk will affect 
consolidated profit or loss. 
Designation of financial items as hedged items 
81 
If the hedged item is a financial asset or financial liability, it may be a hedged item with respect to the risks 
associated with only a portion of its cash flows or fair value (such as one or more selected contractual cash 
flows or portions of them or a percentage of the fair value) provided that effectiveness can be measured. For 
example, an identifiable and separately measurable portion of the interest rate exposure of an interest-
bearing asset or interest-bearing liability may be designated as the hedged risk (such as a risk-free interest 
rate or benchmark interest rate component of the total interest rate exposure of a hedged financial 
instrument). 
81A 
In a fair value hedge of the interest rate exposure of a portfolio of financial assets or financial liabilities (and 
only in such a hedge), the portion hedged may be designated in terms of an amount of a currency (eg an 
Authorised Version F2021C00192 registered 05/03/2021

STANDARD 
amount of dollars, euro, pounds or rand) rather than as individual assets (or liabilities). Although the 
portfolio may, for risk management purposes, include assets and liabilities, the amount designated is an 
amount of assets or an amount of liabilities. Designation of a net amount including assets and liabilities is 
not permitted. The entity may hedge a portion of the interest rate risk associated with this designated 
amount. For example, in the case of a hedge of a portfolio containing prepayable assets, the entity may 
hedge the change in fair value that is attributable to a change in the hedged interest rate on the basis of 
expected, rather than contractual, repricing dates. When the portion hedged is based on expected repricing 
dates, the effect that changes in the hedged interest rate have on those expected repricing dates shall be 
included when determining the change in the fair value of the hedged item. Consequently, if a portfolio that 
contains prepayable items is hedged with a non-prepayable derivative, ineffectiveness arises if the dates on 
which items in the hedged portfolio are expected to prepay are revised, or actual prepayment dates differ 
from those expected. 
Designation of non-financial items as hedged items 
82 
If the hedged item is a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, it shall be designated as a hedged 
item (a) for foreign currency risks, or (b) in its entirety for all risks, because of the difficulty of 
isolating and measuring the appropriate portion of the cash flows or fair value changes attributable 
to specific risks other than foreign currency risks. 
Designation of groups of items as hedged items 
83 
Similar assets or similar liabilities shall be aggregated and hedged as a group only if the individual assets or 
individual liabilities in the group share the risk exposure that is designated as being hedged. Furthermore, 
the change in fair value attributable to the hedged risk for each individual item in the group shall be 
expected to be approximately proportional to the overall change in fair value attributable to the hedged risk 
of the group of items. 
84 
Because an entity assesses hedge effectiveness by comparing the change in the fair value or cash flow of a 
hedging instrument (or group of similar hedging instruments) and a hedged item (or group of similar hedged 
items), comparing a hedging instrument with an overall net position (eg the net of all fixed rate assets and 
fixed rate liabilities with similar maturities), rather than with a specific hedged item, does not qualify for 
hedge accounting. 
Hedge accounting 
85 
Hedge accounting recognises the offsetting effects on profit or loss of changes in the fair values of the 
hedging instrument and the hedged item. 
86 
Hedging relationships are of three types:  
(a) 
fair value hedge: a hedge of the exposure to changes in fair value of a recognised asset or 
liability or an unrecognised firm commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, 
liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit 
or loss.  
(b) 
cash flow hedge: a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that (i) is attributable to 
a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability (such as all or some future 
interest payments on variable rate debt) or a highly probable forecast transaction and (ii) 
could affect profit or loss.  
(c) 
hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation as defined in AASB 121.  
87 
A hedge of the foreign currency risk of a firm commitment may be accounted for as a fair value hedge or as 
a cash flow hedge. 
88 
A hedging relationship qualifies for hedge accounting under paragraphs 89–102 if, and only if, all of 
the following conditions are met. 
(a) 
At the inception of the hedge there is formal designation and documentation of the hedging 
relationship and the entity’s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the 
hedge. That documentation shall include identification of the hedging instrument, the 
hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity will 
assess the hedging instrument’s effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the 
hedged item’s fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk. 
(b) 
The hedge is expected to be highly effective (see Appendix A paragraphs AG105–AG113A) 
in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk, 
Authorised Version F2021C00192 registered 05/03/2021

AASB 139-compiled 
9 
STANDARD 
consistently with the originally documented risk management strategy for that particular 
hedging relationship. 
(c) 
For cash flow hedges, a forecast transaction that is the subject of the hedge must be highly 
probable and must present an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately 
affect profit or loss. 
(d) 
The effectiveness of the hedge can be reliably measured, ie the fair value or cash flows of the 
hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk and the fair value of the hedging 
instrument can be reliably measured. 
(e) 
The hedge is assessed on an ongoing basis and determined actually to have been highly 
effective throughout the financial reporting periods for which the hedge was designated. 
Fair value hedges 
89 
If a fair value hedge meets the conditions in paragraph 88 during the period, it shall be accounted for 
as follows: 
(a) 
the gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value (for a derivative 
hedging instrument) or the foreign currency component of its carrying amount measured in 
accordance with AASB 121 (for a non-derivative hedging instrument) shall be recognised in 
profit or loss; and 
(b) 
the gain or loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk shall adjust the carrying 
amount of the hedged item and be recognised in profit or loss. This applies if the hedged 
item is otherwise measured at cost. Recognition of the gain or loss attributable to the hedged 
risk in profit or loss applies if the hedged item is a financial asset measured at fair value 
through other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 4.1.2A of AASB 9. 
89A 
For a fair value hedge of the interest rate exposure of a portion of a portfolio of financial assets or financial 
liabilities (and only in such a hedge), the requirement in paragraph 89(b) may be met by presenting the gain 
or loss attributable to the hedged item either:  
(a) 
in a single separate line item within assets, for those repricing time periods for which the hedged 
item is an asset; or 
(b) 
in a single separate line item within liabilities, for those repricing time periods for which the 
hedged item is a liability. 
The separate line items referred to in (a) and (b) above shall be presented next to financial assets or 
financial liabilities. Amounts included in these line items shall be removed from the statement of financial 
position when the assets or liabilities to which they relate are derecognised. 
90 
If only particular risks attributable to a hedged item are hedged, recognised changes in the fair value of the 
hedged item unrelated to the hedged risk are recognised as set out in paragraph 5.7.1 of AASB 9.  
91 
An entity shall discontinue prospectively the hedge accounting specified in paragraph 89 if:  
(a) 
the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised. For this purpose, the 
replacement or rollover of a hedging instrument into another hedging instrument is not an 
expiration or termination if such replacement or rollover is part of the entity’s documented 
hedging strategy. Additionally, for this purpose there is not an expiration or termination of 
the hedging instrument if: 
(i) 
as a consequence of laws or regulations or the introduction of laws or regulations, 
the parties to the hedging instrument agree that one or more clearing 
counterparties replace their original counterparty to become the new 
counterparty to each of the parties. For this purpose, a clearing counterparty is a 
central counterparty (sometimes called a ‘clearing organisation’ or ‘clearing 
agency’) or an entity or entities, for example, a clearing member of a clearing 
organisation or a client of a clearing member of a clearing organisation, that are 
acting as counterparty in order to effect clearing by a central counterparty. 
However, when the parties to the hedging instrument replace their original 
counterparties with different counterparties this paragraph shall apply only if 
each of those parties effects clearing with the same central counterparty. 
(ii) 
other changes, if any, to the hedging instrument are limited to those that are 
necessary to effect such a replacement of the counterparty. Such changes are 
limited to those that are consistent with the terms that would be expected if the 
hedging instrument were originally cleared with the clearing counterparty. These

changes include changes in the collateral requirements, rights to offset receivables 
and payables balances, and charges levied. 
(b) 
the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting in paragraph 88; or 
(c) 
the entity revokes the designation. 
92 
Any adjustment arising from paragraph 89(b) to the carrying amount of a hedged financial 
instrument for which the effective interest method is used (or, in the case of a portfolio hedge of 
interest rate risk, to the separate line item in the statement of financial position described in 
paragraph 89A) shall be amortised to profit or loss. Amortisation may begin as soon as an adjustment 
exists and shall begin no later than when the hedged item ceases to be adjusted for changes in its fair 
value attributable to the risk being hedged. The adjustment is based on a recalculated effective 
interest rate at the date amortisation begins. However, if, in the case of a fair value hedge of the 
interest rate exposure of a portfolio of financial assets or financial liabilities (and only in such a 
hedge), amortising using a recalculated effective interest rate is not practicable, the adjustment shall 
be amortised using a straight-line method. The adjustment shall be amortised fully by maturity of the 
financial instrument or, in the case of a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk, by expiry of the relevant 
repricing time period.  
93 
When an unrecognised firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change 
in the fair value of the firm commitment attributable to the hedged risk is recognised as an asset or liability 
with a corresponding gain or loss recognised in profit or loss (see paragraph 89(b)). The changes in the fair 
value of the hedging instrument are also recognised in profit or loss.  
94 
When an entity enters into a firm commitment to acquire an asset or assume a liability that is a hedged item 
in a fair value hedge, the initial carrying amount of the asset or liability that results from the entity meeting 
the firm commitment is adjusted to include the cumulative change in the fair value of the firm commitment 
attributable to the hedged risk that was recognised in the statement of financial position. 
Cash flow hedges 
95 
If a cash flow hedge meets the conditions in paragraph 88 during the period, it shall be accounted for 
as follows:  
(a) 
the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an 
effective hedge (see paragraph 88) shall be recognised in other comprehensive income; and 
(b) 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument shall be recognised in 
profit or loss. 
96 
More specifically, a cash flow hedge is accounted for as follows:  
(a) 
the separate component of equity associated with the hedged item is adjusted to the lesser of the 
following (in absolute amounts): 
(i) 
the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument from inception of the hedge; and 
(ii) 
the cumulative change in fair value (present value) of the expected future cash flows on 
the hedged item from inception of the hedge; 
(b) 
any remaining gain or loss on the hedging instrument or designated component of it (that is not an 
effective hedge) is recognised in profit or loss; and 
(c) 
if an entity’s documented risk management strategy for a particular hedging relationship excludes 
from the assessment of hedge effectiveness a specific component of the gain or loss or related 
cash flows on the hedging instrument (see paragraphs 74, 75 and 88(a)), that excluded component 
of gain or loss is recognised in accordance with paragraph 5.7.1 of AASB 9. 
97 
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a 
financial liability, the associated gains or losses that were recognised in other comprehensive income 
in accordance with paragraph 95 shall be reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification 
adjustment (see AASB 101) in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast cash 
flows affect profit or loss (such as in the periods that interest income or interest expense is 
recognised). However, if an entity expects that all or a portion of a loss recognised in other 
comprehensive income will not be recovered in one or more future periods, it shall reclassify into 
profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment the amount that is not expected to be recovered.  
98 
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-financial asset or 
a non-financial liability, or a forecast transaction for a non-financial asset or non-financial liability

It reclassifies the associated gains and losses that were recognised in other comprehensive

not expected to be recovered.  
(b) 
It removes the associated gains and losses that were recognised in other comprehensive 
income in accordance with paragraph 95, and includes them in the initial cost or other 
carrying amount of the asset or liability. 
99 
An entity shall adopt either (a) or (b) in paragraph 98 as its accounting policy and shall apply it 
consistently to all hedges to which paragraph 98 relates.  
100 
For cash flow hedges other than those covered by paragraphs 97 and 98, amounts that had been 
recognised in other comprehensive income shall be reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a 
reclassification adjustment (see AASB 101) in the same period or periods during which the hedged 
forecast cash flows affect profit or loss (for example, when a forecast sale occurs). 
101 
In any of the following circumstances an entity shall discontinue prospectively the hedge accounting 
specified in paragraphs 95–100:  
(a) 
The hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised. In this case, the 
cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in other 
comprehensive income from the period when the hedge was effective (see paragraph 95(a)) 
shall remain separately in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. When the transaction 
occurs, paragraph 97, 98 or 100 applies. For the purpose of this subparagraph, the 
replacement or rollover of a hedging instrument into another hedging instrument is not an 
expiration or termination if such replacement or rollover is part of the entity’s documented 
hedging strategy. Additionally, for the purpose of this subparagraph there is not an 
expiration or termination of the hedging instrument if: 
(i) 
as a consequence of laws or regulations or the introduction of laws or regulations, 
the parties to the hedging instrument agree that one or more clearing 
counterparties replace their original counterparty to become the new 
counterparty to each of the parties. For this purpose, a clearing counterparty is a 
central counterparty (sometimes called a ‘clearing organisation’ or ‘clearing 
agency’) or an entity or entities, for example, a clearing member of a clearing 
organisation or a client of a clearing member of a clearing organisation, that are 
acting as counterparty in order to effect clearing by a central counterparty. 
However, when the parties to the hedging instrument replace their original 
counterparties with different counterparties this paragraph shall apply only if 
each of those parties effects clearing with the same central counterparty. 
(ii) 
other changes, if any, to the hedging instrument are limited to those that are 
necessary to effect such a replacement of the counterparty. Such changes are 
limited to those that are consistent with the terms that would be expected if the 
hedging instrument were originally cleared with the clearing counterparty. These 
changes include changes in the collateral requirements, rights to offset receivables 
and payables balances, and charges levied. 
(b) 
The hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting in paragraph 88. In this case, 
the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in other 
comprehensive income from the period when the hedge was effective (see paragraph 95(a)) 
shall remain separately in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. When the transaction 
occurs, paragraph 97, 98 or 100 applies.  
(c) 
The forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, in which case any related 
cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in other 
comprehensive income from the period when the hedge was effective (see paragraph 95(a)) 
shall be reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment. A forecast 
transaction that is no longer highly probable (see paragraph 88(c)) may still be expected to 
occur.

(d) 
The entity revokes the designation. For hedges of a forecast transaction, the cumulative gain 
or loss on the hedging instrument that has been recognised in other comprehensive income 
from the period when the hedge was effective (see paragraph 95(a)) shall remain separately 
in equity until the forecast transaction occurs or is no longer expected to occur. When the 
transaction occurs, paragraph 97, 98 or 100 applies. If the transaction is no longer expected 
to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive 
income shall be reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment.  
Hedges of a net investment 
102 
Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation, including a hedge of a monetary item that is 
accounted for as part of the net investment (see AASB 121), shall be accounted for similarly to cash 
flow hedges:  
(a) 
the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an 
effective hedge (see paragraph 88) shall be recognised in other comprehensive income; and 
(b) 
the ineffective portion shall be recognised in profit or loss. 
The gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge that has been 
recognised in other comprehensive income shall be reclassified from equity to profit or loss as a 
reclassification adjustment (see AASB 101) in accordance with paragraphs 48–49 of AASB 121 on the 
disposal or partial disposal of the foreign operation. 
Temporary exceptions from applying specific hedge accounting requirements 
102A 
An entity shall apply paragraphs 102D–102N and 108G to all hedging relationships directly affected by 
interest rate benchmark reform. These paragraphs apply only to such hedging relationships. A hedging 
relationship is directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform only if the reform gives rise to 
uncertainties about: 
(a) 
the interest rate benchmark (contractually or non-contractually specified) designated as a hedged 
risk; and/or 
(b) 
the timing or the amount of interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item or of the 
hedging instrument. 
102B 
For the purpose of applying paragraphs 102D–102N, the term ‘interest rate benchmark reform’ refers to the 
market-wide reform of an interest rate benchmark, including the replacement of an interest rate benchmark 
with an alternative benchmark rate such as that resulting from the recommendations set out in the Financial 
Stability Board’s July 2014 report ‘Reforming Major Interest Rate Benchmarks’.1 
102C 
Paragraphs 102D–102N provide exceptions only to the requirements specified in these paragraphs. An 
entity shall continue to apply all other hedge accounting requirements to hedging relationships directly 
affected by interest rate benchmark reform. 
Highly probable requirement for cash flow hedges  
102D 
For the purpose of applying the requirement in paragraph 88(c) that a forecast transaction must be highly 
probable, an entity shall assume that the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows 
(contractually or non-contractually specified) are based is not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark 
reform. 
Reclassifying the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income 
102E 
For the purpose of applying the requirement in paragraph 101(c) in order to determine whether the forecast 
transaction is no longer expected to occur, an entity shall assume that the interest rate benchmark on which 
the hedged cash flows (contractually or non-contractually specified) are based is not altered as a result of 
interest rate benchmark reform.

Effectiveness assessment 
102F 
For the purpose of applying the requirements in paragraphs 88(b) and AG105(a), an entity shall assume that 
the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged cash flows and/or the hedged risk (contractually or non-
contractually specified) are based, or the interest rate benchmark on which the cash flows of the hedging 
instrument are based, is not altered as a result of interest rate benchmark reform. 
102G 
For the purpose of applying the requirement in paragraph 88(e), an entity is not required to discontinue a 
hedging relationship because the actual results of the hedge do not meet the requirements in paragraph 
AG105(b). For the avoidance of doubt, an entity shall apply the other conditions in paragraph 88, including 
the prospective assessment in paragraph 88(b), to assess whether the hedging relationship must be 
discontinued. 
Designating financial items as hedged items 
102H 
Unless paragraph 102I applies, for a hedge of a non-contractually specified benchmark portion of interest 
rate risk, an entity shall apply the requirement in paragraphs 81 and AG99F—that the designated portion 
shall be separately identifiable—only at the inception of the hedging relationship. 
102I 
When an entity, consistent with its hedge documentation, frequently resets (ie discontinues and restarts) a 
hedging relationship because both the hedging instrument and the hedged item frequently change (ie the 
entity uses a dynamic process in which both the hedged items and the hedging instruments used to manage 
that exposure do not remain the same for long), the entity shall apply the requirement in paragraphs 81 and 
AG99F—that the designated portion is separately identifiable—only when it initially designates a hedged 
item in that hedging relationship. A hedged item that has been assessed at the time of its initial designation 
in the hedging relationship, whether it was at the time of the hedge inception or subsequently, is not 
reassessed at any subsequent redesignation in the same hedging relationship. 
End of application 
102J 
An entity shall prospectively cease applying paragraph 102D to a hedged item at the earlier of: 
(a) 
when the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform is no longer present with 
respect to the timing and the amount of the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of the 
hedged item; and 
(b) 
when the hedging relationship that the hedged item is part of is discontinued. 
102K 
An entity shall prospectively cease applying paragraph 102E at the earlier of: 
(a) 
when the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform is no longer present with 
respect to the timing and the amount of the interest rate benchmark-based future cash flows of the 
hedged item; and 
(b) 
when the entire cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income with respect to 
that discontinued hedging relationship has been reclassified to profit or loss. 
102L 
An entity shall prospectively cease applying paragraph 102F: 
(a) 
to a hedged item, when the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform is no longer 
present with respect to the hedged risk or the timing and the amount of the interest rate 
benchmark-based cash flows of the hedged item; and 
(b) 
to a hedging instrument, when the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform is no 
longer present with respect to the timing and the amount of the interest rate benchmark-based 
cash flows of the hedging instrument. 
If the hedging relationship that the hedged item and the hedging instrument are part of is discontinued 
earlier than the date specified in paragraph 102L(a) or the date specified in paragraph 102L(b), the entity 
shall prospectively cease applying paragraph 102F to that hedging relationship at the date of 
discontinuation. 
102M 
An entity shall prospectively cease applying paragraph 102G to a hedging relationship at the earlier of: 
(a) 
when the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform is no longer present with 
respect to the hedged risk and the timing and the amount of the interest rate benchmark-based 
cash flows of the hedged item and of the hedging instrument; and 
(b) 
when the hedging relationship to which the exception is applied is discontinued.

STANDARD 
102N 
When designating a group of items as the hedged item, or a combination of financial instruments as the 
hedging instrument, an entity shall prospectively cease applying paragraphs 102D–102G to an individual 
item or financial instrument in accordance with paragraphs 102J, 102K, 102L, or 102M, as relevant, when 
the uncertainty arising from interest rate benchmark reform is no longer present with respect to the hedged 
risk and/or the timing and the amount of the interest rate benchmark-based cash flows of that item or 
financial instrument. 
102O 
An entity shall prospectively cease applying paragraphs 102H and 102I at the earlier of: 
(a) 
when changes required by interest rate benchmark reform are made to the non-contractually 
specified risk portion applying paragraph 102P; or 
(b) 
when the hedging relationship in which the non-contractually specified risk portion is designated 
is discontinued. 
Additional temporary exceptions arising from interest rate benchmark reform 
Hedge accounting 
102P 
As and when the requirements in paragraphs 102D–102I cease to apply to a hedging relationship (see 
paragraphs 102J–102O), an entity shall amend the formal designation of that hedging relationship as 
previously documented to reflect the changes required by interest rate benchmark reform, ie the changes are 
consistent with the requirements in paragraphs 5.4.6–5.4.8 of AASB 9. In this context, the hedge 
designation shall be amended only to make one or more of these changes: 
(a) 
designating an alternative benchmark rate (contractually or non-contractually specified) as a 
hedged risk; 
(b) 
amending the description of the hedged item, including the description of the designated portion 
of the cash flows or fair value being hedged; 
(c) 
amending the description of the hedging instrument; or 
(d) 
amending the description of how the entity will assess hedge effectiveness. 
102Q 
An entity also shall apply the requirement in paragraph 102P(c) if these three conditions are met: 
(a) 
the entity makes a change required by interest rate benchmark reform using an approach other 
than changing the basis for determining the contractual cash flows of the hedging instrument (as 
described in paragraph 5.4.6 of AASB 9); 
(b) 
the original hedging instrument is not derecognised; and 
(c) 
the chosen approach is economically equivalent to changing the basis for determining the 
contractual cash flows of the original hedging instrument (as described in paragraphs 5.4.7 and 
5.4.8 of AASB 9). 
102R 
The requirements in paragraphs 102D–102I may cease to apply at different times. Therefore, applying 
paragraph 102P, an entity may be required to amend the formal designation of its hedging relationships at 
different times, or may be required to amend the formal designation of a hedging relationship more than 
once. When, and only when, such a change is made to the hedge designation, an entity shall apply 
paragraphs 102V–102Z2 as applicable. An entity also shall apply paragraph 89 (for a fair value hedge) or 
paragraph 96 (for a cash flow hedge) to account for any changes in the fair value of the hedged item or the 
hedging instrument. 
102S 
An entity shall amend a hedging relationship as required in paragraph 102P by the end of the reporting 
period during which a change required by interest rate benchmark reform is made to the hedged risk, 
hedged item or hedging instrument. For the avoidance of doubt, such an amendment to the formal 
designation of a hedging relationship constitutes neither the discontinuation of the hedging relationship nor 
the designation of a new hedging relationship. 
102T 
If changes are made in addition to those changes required by interest rate benchmark reform to the financial 
asset or financial liability designated in a hedging relationship (as described in paragraphs 5.4.6–5.4.8 of 
AASB 9) or to the designation of the hedging relationship (as required by paragraph 102P), an entity shall 
first apply the applicable requirements in this Standard to determine if those additional changes result in the 
discontinuation of hedge accounting. If the additional changes do not result in the discontinuation of hedge 
accounting, an entity shall amend the formal designation of the hedging relationship as specified in 
paragraph 102P.

STANDARD 
102U 
Paragraphs 102V–102Z3 provide exceptions to the requirements specified in those paragraphs only. An 
entity shall apply all other hedge accounting requirements in this Standard, including the qualifying criteria 
in paragraph 88, to hedging relationships that were directly affected by interest rate benchmark reform. 
Accounting for qualifying hedging relationships 
Retrospective effectiveness assessment 
102V 
For the purpose of assessing the retrospective effectiveness of a hedging relationship on a cumulative basis 
applying paragraph 88(e) and only for this purpose, an entity may elect to reset to zero the cumulative fair 
value changes of the hedged item and hedging instrument when ceasing to apply paragraph 102G as 
required by paragraph 102M. This election is made separately for each hedging relationship (ie on an 
individual hedging relationship basis). 
Cash flow hedges 
102W 
For the purpose of applying paragraph 97, at the point when an entity amends the description of a hedged 
item as required in paragraph 102P(b), the cumulative gain or loss in other comprehensive income shall be 
deemed to be based on the alternative benchmark rate on which the hedged future cash flows are 
determined. 
102X 
For a discontinued hedging relationship, when the interest rate benchmark on which the hedged future cash 
flows had been based is changed as required by interest rate benchmark reform, for the purpose of applying 
paragraph 101(c) in order to determine whether the hedged future cash flows are expected to occur, the 
amount accumulated in other comprehensive income for that hedging relationship shall be deemed to be 
based on the alternative benchmark rate on which the hedged future cash flows will be based. 
Groups of items 
102Y 
When an entity applies paragraph 102P to groups of items designated as hedged items in a fair value or cash 
flow hedge, the entity shall allocate the hedged items to subgroups based on the benchmark rate being 
hedged and designate the benchmark rate as the hedged risk for each subgroup. For example, in a hedging 
relationship in which a group of items is hedged for changes in an interest rate benchmark subject to interest 
rate benchmark reform, the hedged cash flows or fair value of some items in the group could be changed to 
reference an alternative benchmark rate before other items in the group are changed. In this example, in 
applying paragraph 102P, the entity would designate the alternative benchmark rate as the hedged risk for 
that relevant subgroup of hedged items. The entity would continue to designate the existing interest rate 
benchmark as the hedged risk for the other subgroup of hedged items until the hedged cash flows or fair 
value of those items are changed to reference the alternative benchmark rate or the items expire and are 
replaced with hedged items that reference the alternative benchmark rate. 
102Z 
An entity shall assess separately whether each subgroup meets the requirements in paragraphs 78 and 83 to 
be an eligible hedged item. If any subgroup fails to meet the requirements in paragraphs 78 and 83, the 
entity shall discontinue hedge accounting prospectively for the hedging relationship in its entirety. An entity 
also shall apply the requirements in paragraphs 89 or 96 to account for ineffectiveness related to the 
hedging relationship in its entirety. 
Designating financial items as hedged items 
102Z1 
An alternative benchmark rate designated as a non-contractually specified risk portion that is not separately 
identifiable (see paragraphs 81 and AG99F) at the date it is designated shall be deemed to have met that 
requirement at that date, if, and only if, the entity reasonably expects the alternative benchmark rate will be 
separately identifiable within 24 months. The 24-month period applies to each alternative benchmark rate 
separately and starts from the date the entity designates the alternative benchmark rate as a non-
contractually specified risk portion for the first time (ie the 24-month period applies on a rate-by-rate basis). 
102Z2 
If subsequently an entity reasonably expects that the alternative benchmark rate will not be separately 
identifiable within 24 months from the date the entity designated it as a non-contractually specified risk 
portion for the first time, the entity shall cease applying the requirement in paragraph 102Z1 to that 
alternative benchmark rate and discontinue hedge accounting prospectively from the date of that 
reassessment for all hedging relationships in which the alternative benchmark rate was designated as a non-
contractually specified risk portion.

108I 
An entity shall designate a new hedging relationship (for example, as described in paragraph 102Z3) only 
prospectively (ie an entity is prohibited from designating a new hedge accounting relationship in prior 
periods). However, an entity shall reinstate a discontinued hedging relationship if, and only if, these 
conditions are met: 
(a) 
the entity had discontinued that hedging relationship solely due to changes required by interest 
rate benchmark reform and the entity would not have been required to discontinue that hedging 
relationship if these amendments had been applied at that time; and 
(b) 
at the beginning of the reporting period in which an entity first applies these amendments (date of 
initial application of these amendments), that discontinued hedging relationship meets the 
qualifying criteria for hedge accounting (after taking into account these amendments). 
108J 
If, in applying paragraph 108I, an entity reinstates a discontinued hedging relationship, the entity shall read 
references in paragraphs 102Z1 and 102Z2 to the date the alternative benchmark rate is designated as a non-
contractually specified risk portion for the first time as referring to the date of initial application of these 
amendments (ie the 24-month period for that alternative benchmark rate designated as a non-contractually 
specified risk portion begins from the date of initial application of these amendments). 
108K 
An entity is not required to restate prior periods to reflect the application of these amendments. The entity 
may restate prior periods if, and only if, it is possible without the use of hindsight. If an entity does not 
restate prior periods, the entity shall recognise any difference between the previous carrying amount and the 
carrying amount at the beginning of the annual reporting period that includes the date of initial application 
of these amendments in the opening retained earnings (or other component of equity, as appropriate) of the 
annual reporting period that includes the date of initial application of these amendments.

Hedging (paragraphs 71–102) 
Hedging instruments (paragraphs 72–77) 
Qualifying instruments (paragraphs 72 and 73) 
AG94 
The potential loss on an option that an entity writes could be significantly greater than the potential gain in 
value of a related hedged item. In other words, a written option is not effective in reducing the profit or loss 
exposure of a hedged item. Therefore, a written option does not qualify as a hedging instrument unless it is 
designated as an offset to a purchased option, including one that is embedded in another financial 
instrument (for example, a written call option used to hedge a callable liability). In contrast, a purchased 
option has potential gains equal to or greater than losses and therefore has the potential to reduce profit or 
loss exposure from changes in fair values or cash flows. Accordingly, it can qualify as a hedging 
instrument. 
AG95 
A financial asset measured at amortised cost may be designated as a hedging instrument in a hedge of 
foreign currency risk. 
AG96 
[Deleted] 
AG97 
An entity’s own equity instruments are not financial assets or financial liabilities of the entity and therefore 
cannot be designated as hedging instruments. 
Hedged items (paragraphs 78–84) 
Qualifying items (paragraphs 78–80) 
AG98 
A firm commitment to acquire a business in a business combination cannot be a hedged item, except for 
foreign exchange risk, because the other risks being hedged cannot be specifically identified and measured. 
These other risks are general business risks. 
AG99 
An equity method investment cannot be a hedged item in a fair value hedge because the equity method 
recognises in profit or loss the investor’s share of the associate’s profit or loss, rather than changes in the 
investment’s fair value. For a similar reason, an investment in a consolidated subsidiary cannot be a hedged 
item in a fair value hedge because consolidation recognises in profit or loss the subsidiary’s profit or loss, 
rather than changes in the investment’s fair value. A hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is 
different because it is a hedge of the foreign currency exposure, not a fair value hedge of the change in the 
value of the investment. 
AG99A Paragraph 80 states that in consolidated financial statements the foreign currency risk of a highly probable 
forecast intragroup transaction may qualify as a hedged item in a cash flow hedge, provided the transaction 
is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity entering into that transaction 
and the foreign currency risk will affect consolidated profit or loss. For this purpose an entity can be a 
parent, subsidiary, associate, joint venture or branch. If the foreign currency risk of a forecast intragroup 
transaction does not affect consolidated profit or loss, the intragroup transaction cannot qualify as a hedged 
item. This is usually the case for royalty payments, interest payments or management charges between 
members of the same group unless there is a related external transaction. However, when the foreign 
currency risk of a forecast intragroup transaction will affect consolidated profit or loss, the intragroup 
transaction can qualify as a hedged item. An example is forecast sales or purchases of inventories between 
members of the same group if there is an onward sale of the inventory to a party external to the group. 
Similarly, a forecast intragroup sale of plant and equipment from the group entity that manufactured it to a 
group entity that will use the plant and equipment in its operations may affect consolidated profit or loss. 
This could occur, for example, because the plant and equipment will be depreciated by the purchasing entity

AASB 139-compiled 
20 
APPENDIX A 
and the amount initially recognised for the plant and equipment may change if the forecast intragroup 
transaction is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the purchasing entity. 
AG99B If a hedge of a forecast intragroup transaction qualifies for hedge accounting, any gain or loss that is 
recognised in other comprehensive income in accordance with paragraph 95(a) shall be reclassified from 
equity to profit or loss as a reclassification adjustment in the same period or periods during which the 
foreign currency risk of the hedged transaction affects consolidated profit or loss. 
AG99BA An entity can designate all changes in the cash flows or fair value of a hedged item in a hedging 
relationship. An entity can also designate only changes in the cash flows or fair value of a hedged item 
above or below a specified price or other variable (a one-sided risk). The intrinsic value of a purchased 
option hedging instrument (assuming that it has the same principal terms as the designated risk), but not its 
time value, reflects a one-sided risk in a hedged item. For example, an entity can designate the variability of 
future cash flow outcomes resulting from a price increase of a forecast commodity purchase. In such a 
situation, only cash flow losses that result from an increase in the price above the specified level are 
designated. The hedged risk does not include the time value of a purchased option because the time value is 
not a component of the forecast transaction that affects profit or loss (paragraph 86(b)).  
Designation of financial items as hedged items (paragraphs 81 and 81A) 
AG99C If a portion of the cash flows of a financial asset or financial liability is designated as the hedged item, that 
designated portion must be less than the total cash flows of the asset or liability. For example, in the case of 
a liability whose effective interest rate is below LIBOR, an entity cannot designate (a) a portion of the 
liability equal to the principal amount plus interest at LIBOR and (b) a negative residual portion. However, 
the entity may designate all of the cash flows of the entire financial asset or financial liability as the hedged 
item and hedge them for only one particular risk (eg only for changes that are attributable to changes in 
LIBOR). For example, in the case of a financial liability whose effective interest rate is 100 basis points 
below LIBOR, an entity can designate as the hedged item the entire liability (ie principal plus interest at 
LIBOR minus 100 basis points) and hedge the change in the fair value or cash flows of that entire liability 
that is attributable to changes in LIBOR. The entity may also choose a hedge ratio of other than one to one 
in order to improve the effectiveness of the hedge as described in paragraph AG100. 
AG99D In addition, if a fixed rate financial instrument is hedged some time after its origination and interest rates 
have changed in the meantime, the entity can designate a portion equal to a benchmark rate that is higher 
than the contractual rate paid on the item. The entity can do so provided that the benchmark rate is less than 
the effective interest rate calculated on the assumption that the entity had purchased the instrument on the 
day it first designates the hedged item. For example, assume an entity originates a fixed rate financial asset 
of CU100 that has an effective interest rate of 6 per cent at a time when LIBOR is 4 per cent. It begins to 
hedge that asset some time later when LIBOR has increased to 8 per cent and the fair value of the asset has 
decreased to CU90. The entity calculates that if it had purchased the asset on the date it first designates it as 
the hedged item for its then fair value of CU90, the effective yield would have been 9.5 per cent. Because 
LIBOR is less than this effective yield, the entity can designate a LIBOR portion of 8 per cent that consists 
partly of the contractual interest cash flows and partly of the difference between the current fair value (ie 
CU90) and the amount repayable on maturity (ie CU100). 
AG99E 
Paragraph 81 permits an entity to designate something other than the entire fair value change or cash flow 
variability of a financial instrument. For example: 
(a) 
all of the cash flows of a financial instrument may be designated for cash flow or fair value 
changes attributable to some (but not all) risks; or 
(b) 
some (but not all) of the cash flows of a financial instrument may be designated for cash flow or 
fair value changes attributable to all or only some risks (ie a ‘portion’ of the cash flows of the 
financial instrument may be designated for changes attributable to all or only some risks). 
AG99F 
To be eligible for hedge accounting, the designated risks and portions must be separately identifiable 
components of the financial instrument, and changes in the cash flows or fair value of the entire financial 
instrument arising from changes in the designated risks and portions must be reliably measurable. For 
example: 
(a) 
for a fixed rate financial instrument hedged for changes in fair value attributable to changes in a 
risk-free or benchmark interest rate, the risk-free or benchmark rate is normally regarded as both 
a separately identifiable component of the financial instrument and reliably measurable. 
(b) 
inflation is not separately identifiable and reliably measurable and cannot be designated as a risk 
or a portion of a financial instrument unless the requirements in (c) are met. 
(c) 
a contractually specified inflation portion of the cash flows of a recognised inflation-linked bond 
(assuming there is no requirement to account for an embedded derivative separately) is separately 
Authorised Version F2021C00192 registered 05/03/2021

AASB 139-compiled 
21 
APPENDIX A 
identifiable and reliably measurable as long as other cash flows of the instrument are not affected 
by the inflation portion. 
Designation of non-financial items as hedged items (paragraph 82) 
AG100 
Changes in the price of an ingredient or component of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability 
generally do not have a predictable, separately measurable effect on the price of the item that is comparable 
to the effect of, say, a change in market interest rates on the price of a bond. Thus, a non-financial asset or 
non-financial liability is a hedged item only in its entirety or for foreign exchange risk. If there is a 
difference between the terms of the hedging instrument and the hedged item (such as for a hedge of the 
forecast purchase of Brazilian coffee using a forward contract to purchase Colombian coffee on otherwise 
similar terms), the hedging relationship nonetheless can qualify as a hedge relationship provided all the 
conditions in paragraph 88 are met, including that the hedge is expected to be highly effective. For this 
purpose, the amount of the hedging instrument may be greater or less than that of the hedged item if this 
improves the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. For example, a regression analysis could be 
performed to establish a statistical relationship between the hedged item (eg a transaction in Brazilian 
coffee) and the hedging instrument (eg a transaction in Colombian coffee). If there is a valid statistical 
relationship between the two variables (ie between the unit prices of Brazilian coffee and Colombian 
coffee), the slope of the regression line can be used to establish the hedge ratio that will maximise expected 
effectiveness. For example, if the slope of the regression line is 1.02, a hedge ratio based on 0.98 quantities 
of hedged items to 1.00 quantities of the hedging instrument maximises expected effectiveness. However, 
the hedging relationship may result in ineffectiveness that is recognised in profit or loss during the term of 
the hedging relationship. 
Designation of groups of items as hedged items (paragraphs 83 and 84) 
AG101 
A hedge of an overall net position (eg the net of all fixed rate assets and fixed rate liabilities with similar 
maturities), rather than of a specific hedged item, does not qualify for hedge accounting. However, almost 
the same effect on profit or loss of hedge accounting for this type of hedging relationship can be achieved 
by designating as the hedged item part of the underlying items. For example, if a bank has CU100 of assets 
and CU90 of liabilities with risks and terms of a similar nature and hedges the net CU10 exposure, it can 
designate as the hedged item CU10 of those assets. This designation can be used if such assets and 
liabilities are fixed rate instruments, in which case it is a fair value hedge, or if they are variable rate 
instruments, in which case it is a cash flow hedge. Similarly, if an entity has a firm commitment to make a 
purchase in a foreign currency of CU100 and a firm commitment to make a sale in the foreign currency of 
CU90, it can hedge the net amount of CU10 by acquiring a derivative and designating it as a hedging 
instrument associated with CU10 of the firm purchase commitment of CU100. 
Hedge accounting (paragraphs 85–102) 
AG102 
An example of a fair value hedge is a hedge of exposure to changes in the fair value of a fixed rate debt 
instrument as a result of changes in interest rates. Such a hedge could be entered into by the issuer or by the 
holder. 
AG103 
An example of a cash flow hedge is the use of a swap to change floating rate debt to fixed rate debt (ie a 
hedge of a future transaction where the future cash flows being hedged are the future interest payments). 
AG104 
A hedge of a firm commitment (eg a hedge of the change in fuel price relating to an unrecognised 
contractual commitment by an electric utility to purchase fuel at a fixed price) is a hedge of an exposure to a 
change in fair value. Accordingly, such a hedge is a fair value hedge. However, under paragraph 87 a hedge 
of the foreign currency risk of a firm commitment could alternatively be accounted for as a cash flow 
hedge. 
Assessing hedge effectiveness 
AG105 
A hedge is regarded as highly effective only if both of the following conditions are met:  
(a) 
At the inception of the hedge and in subsequent periods, the hedge is expected to be highly 
effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value or cash flows attributable to the hedged risk 
during the period for which the hedge is designated. Such an expectation can be demonstrated in 
various ways, including a comparison of past changes in the fair value or cash flows of the 
hedged item that are attributable to the hedged risk with past changes in the fair value or cash 
flows of the hedging instrument, or by demonstrating a high statistical correlation between the 
fair value or cash flows of the hedged item and those of the hedging instrument. The entity may

AASB 139-compiled 
22 
APPENDIX A 
choose a hedge ratio of other than one to one in order to improve the effectiveness of the hedge as 
described in paragraph AG100. 
(b) 
The actual results of the hedge are within a range of 80–125 per cent. For example, if actual 
results are such that the loss on the hedging instrument is CU120 and the gain on the cash 
instrument is CU100, offset can be measured by 120/100, which is 120 per cent, or by 100/120, 
which is 83 per cent. In this example, assuming the hedge meets the condition in (a), the entity 
would conclude that the hedge has been highly effective. 
AG106 
Effectiveness is assessed, at a minimum, at the time an entity prepares its annual or interim financial 
statements. 
AG107 
This Standard does not specify a single method for assessing hedge effectiveness. The method an entity 
adopts for assessing hedge effectiveness depends on its risk management strategy. For example, if the 
entity’s risk management strategy is to adjust the amount of the hedging instrument periodically to reflect 
changes in the hedged position, the entity needs to demonstrate that the hedge is expected to be highly 
effective only for the period until the amount of the hedging instrument is next adjusted. In some cases, an 
entity adopts different methods for different types of hedges. An entity’s documentation of its hedging 
strategy includes its procedures for assessing effectiveness. Those procedures state whether the assessment 
includes all of the gain or loss on a hedging instrument or whether the instrument’s time value is excluded. 
AG107A If an entity hedges less than 100 per cent of the exposure on an item, such as 85 per cent, it shall designate 
the hedged item as being 85 per cent of the exposure and shall measure ineffectiveness based on the change 
in that designated 85 per cent exposure. However, when hedging the designated 85 per cent exposure, the 
entity may use a hedge ratio of other than one to one if that improves the expected effectiveness of the 
hedge, as explained in paragraph AG100. 
AG108 
If the principal terms of the hedging instrument and of the hedged asset, liability, firm commitment or 
highly probable forecast transaction are the same, the changes in fair value and cash flows attributable to the 
risk being hedged may be likely to offset each other fully, both when the hedge is entered into and 
afterwards. For example, an interest rate swap is likely to be an effective hedge if the notional and principal 
amounts, term, repricing dates, dates of interest and principal receipts and payments, and basis for 
measuring interest rates are the same for the hedging instrument and the hedged item. In addition, a hedge 
of a highly probable forecast purchase of a commodity with a forward contract is likely to be highly 
effective if: 
(a) 
the forward contract is for the purchase of the same quantity of the same commodity at the same 
time and location as the hedged forecast purchase; 
(b) 
the fair value of the forward contract at inception is zero; and 
(c) 
either the change in the discount or premium on the forward contract is excluded from the 
assessment of effectiveness and recognised in profit or loss or the change in expected cash flows 
on the highly probable forecast transaction is based on the forward price for the commodity. 
AG109 
Sometimes the hedging instrument offsets only part of the hedged risk. For example, a hedge would not be 
fully effective if the hedging instrument and hedged item are denominated in different currencies that do not 
move in tandem. Also, a hedge of interest rate risk using a derivative would not be fully effective if part of 
the change in the fair value of the derivative is attributable to the counterparty’s credit risk. 
AG110 
To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedge must relate to a specific identified and designated risk, and not 
merely to the entity’s general business risks, and must ultimately affect the entity’s profit or loss. A hedge 
of the risk of obsolescence of a physical asset or the risk of expropriation of property by a government is not 
eligible for hedge accounting; effectiveness cannot be measured because those risks are not measurable 
reliably. 
AG110A Paragraph 74(a) permits an entity to separate the intrinsic value and time value of an option contract and 
designate as the hedging instrument only the change in the intrinsic value of the option contract. Such a 
designation may result in a hedging relationship that is perfectly effective in achieving offsetting changes in 
cash flows attributable to a hedged one-sided risk of a forecast transaction, if the principal terms of the 
forecast transaction and hedging instrument are the same. 
AG110B If an entity designates a purchased option in its entirety as the hedging instrument of a one-sided risk arising 
from a forecast transaction, the hedging relationship will not be perfectly effective. This is because the 
premium paid for the option includes time value and, as stated in paragraph AG99BA, a designated one-
sided risk does not include the time value of an option. Therefore, in this situation, there will be no offset 
between the cash flows relating to the time value of the option premium paid and the designated hedged 
risk.

AASB 139-compiled

APPENDIX A 
AG111 
In the case of interest rate risk, hedge effectiveness may be assessed by preparing a maturity schedule for 
financial assets and financial liabilities that shows the net interest rate exposure for each time period, 
provided that the net exposure is associated with a specific asset or liability (or a specific group of assets or 
liabilities or a specific portion of them) giving rise to the net exposure, and hedge effectiveness is assessed 
against that asset or liability. 
AG112 
In assessing the effectiveness of a hedge, an entity generally considers the time value of money. The fixed 
interest rate on a hedged item need not exactly match the fixed interest rate on a swap designated as a fair 
value hedge. Nor does the variable interest rate on an interest-bearing asset or liability need to be the same 
as the variable interest rate on a swap designated as a cash flow hedge. A swap’s fair value derives from its 
net settlements. The fixed and variable rates on a swap can be changed without affecting the net settlement 
if both are changed by the same amount. 
AG113 
If an entity does not meet hedge effectiveness criteria, the entity discontinues hedge accounting from the 
last date on which compliance with hedge effectiveness was demonstrated. However, if the entity identifies 
the event or change in circumstances that caused the hedging relationship to fail the effectiveness criteria, 
and demonstrates that the hedge was effective before the event or change in circumstances occurred, the 
entity discontinues hedge accounting from the date of the event or change in circumstances. 
AG113A For the avoidance of doubt, the effects of replacing the original counterparty with a clearing counterparty 
and making the associated changes as described in paragraphs 91(a)(ii) and 101(a)(ii) shall be reflected in 
the measurement of the hedging instrument and therefore in the assessment of hedge effectiveness and the 
measurement of hedge effectiveness. 
Fair value hedge accounting for a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk 
AG114 
For a fair value hedge of interest rate risk associated with a portfolio of financial assets or financial 
liabilities, an entity would meet the requirements of this Standard if it complies with the procedures set out 
in (a)–(i) and paragraphs AG115–AG132 below. 
(a) 
As part of its risk management process the entity identifies a portfolio of items whose interest rate 
risk it wishes to hedge. The portfolio may comprise only assets, only liabilities or both assets and 
liabilities. The entity may identify two or more portfolios, in which case it applies the guidance 
below to each portfolio separately. 
(b) 
The entity analyses the portfolio into repricing time periods based on expected, rather than 
contractual, repricing dates. The analysis into repricing time periods may be performed in various 
ways including scheduling cash flows into the periods in which they are expected to occur, or 
scheduling notional principal amounts into all periods until repricing is expected to occur. 
(c) 
On the basis of this analysis, the entity decides the amount it wishes to hedge. The entity 
designates as the hedged item an amount of assets or liabilities (but not a net amount) from the 
identified portfolio equal to the amount it wishes to designate as being hedged. This amount also 
determines the percentage measure that is used for testing effectiveness in accordance with 
paragraph AG126(b). 
(d) 
The entity designates the interest rate risk it is hedging. This risk could be a portion of the interest 
rate risk in each of the items in the hedged position, such as a benchmark interest rate (eg 
LIBOR). 
(e) 
The entity designates one or more hedging instruments for each repricing time period. 
(f) 
Using the designations made in (c)–(e) above, the entity assesses at inception and in subsequent 
periods, whether the hedge is expected to be highly effective during the period for which the 
hedge is designated. 
(g) 
Periodically, the entity measures the change in the fair value of the hedged item (as designated in 
(c)) that is attributable to the hedged risk (as designated in (d)), on the basis of the expected 
repricing dates determined in (b). Provided that the hedge is determined actually to have been 
highly effective when assessed using the entity’s documented method of assessing effectiveness, 
the entity recognises the change in fair value of the hedged item as a gain or loss in profit or loss 
and in one of two line items in the statement of financial position as described in paragraph 89A. 
The change in fair value need not be allocated to individual assets or liabilities. 
(h) 
The entity measures the change in fair value of the hedging instrument(s) (as designated in (e)) 
and recognises it as a gain or loss in profit or loss. The fair value of the hedging instrument(s) is 
recognised as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position.

AASB 139-compiled 
24 
APPENDIX A 
(i) 
Any ineffectiveness2 will be recognised in profit or loss as the difference between the change in 
fair value referred to in (g) and that referred to in (h). 
AG115 
This approach is described in more detail below. The approach shall be applied only to a fair value hedge of 
the interest rate risk associated with a portfolio of financial assets or financial liabilities. 
AG116 
The portfolio identified in paragraph AG114(a) could contain assets and liabilities. Alternatively, it could be 
a portfolio containing only assets, or only liabilities. The portfolio is used to determine the amount of the 
assets or liabilities the entity wishes to hedge. However, the portfolio is not itself designated as the hedged 
item. 
AG117 
In applying paragraph AG114(b), the entity determines the expected repricing date of an item as the earlier 
of the dates when that item is expected to mature or to reprice to market rates. The expected repricing dates 
are estimated at the inception of the hedge and throughout the term of the hedge, based on historical 
experience and other available information, including information and expectations regarding prepayment 
rates, interest rates and the interaction between them. Entities that have no entity-specific experience or 
insufficient experience use peer group experience for comparable financial instruments. These estimates are 
reviewed periodically and updated in the light of experience. In the case of a fixed rate item that is 
prepayable, the expected repricing date is the date on which the item is expected to prepay unless it reprices 
to market rates on an earlier date. For a group of similar items, the analysis into time periods based on 
expected repricing dates may take the form of allocating a percentage of the group, rather than individual 
items, to each time period. An entity may apply other methodologies for such allocation purposes. For 
example, it may use a prepayment rate multiplier for allocating amortising loans to time periods based on 
expected repricing dates. However, the methodology for such an allocation shall be in accordance with the 
entity’s risk management procedures and objectives. 
AG118 
As an example of the designation set out in paragraph AG114(c), if in a particular repricing time period an 
entity estimates that it has fixed rate assets of CU100 and fixed rate liabilities of CU80 and decides to hedge 
all of the net position of CU20, it designates as the hedged item assets in the amount of CU20 (a portion of 
the assets).3 The designation is expressed as an ‘amount of a currency’ (eg an amount of dollars, euro, 
pounds or rand) rather than as individual assets. It follows that all of the assets (or liabilities) from which 
the hedged amount is drawn—ie all of the CU100 of assets in the above example—must be: 
(a) 
items whose fair value changes in response to changes in the interest rate being hedged; and 
(b) 
items that could have qualified for fair value hedge accounting if they had been designated as 
hedged individually. In particular, because AASB 13 specifies that the fair value of a financial 
liability with a demand feature (such as demand deposits and some types of time deposits) is not 
less than the amount payable on demand, discounted from the first date that the amount could be 
required to be paid, such an item cannot qualify for fair value hedge accounting for any time 
period beyond the shortest period in which the holder can demand payment. In the above 
example, the hedged position is an amount of assets. Hence, such liabilities are not a part of the 
designated hedged item, but are used by the entity to determine the amount of the asset that is 
designated as being hedged. If the position the entity wished to hedge was an amount of 
liabilities, the amount representing the designated hedged item must be drawn from fixed rate 
liabilities other than liabilities that the entity can be required to repay in an earlier time period, 
and the percentage measure used for assessing hedge effectiveness in accordance with paragraph 
AG126(b) would be calculated as a percentage of these other liabilities. For example, assume that 
an entity estimates that in a particular repricing time period it has fixed rate liabilities of CU100, 
comprising CU40 of demand deposits and CU60 of liabilities with no demand feature, and CU70 
of fixed rate assets. If the entity decides to hedge all of the net position of CU30, it designates as 
the hedged item liabilities of CU30 or 50 per cent of the liabilities4 with no demand feature. 
AG119 
The entity also complies with the other designation and documentation requirements set out in paragraph 
88(a). For a portfolio hedge of interest rate risk, this designation and documentation specifies the entity’s 
policy for all of the variables that are used to identify the amount that is hedged and how effectiveness is 
measured, including the following:  
(a) 
which assets and liabilities are to be included in the portfolio hedge and the basis to be used for 
removing them from the portfolio. 
(b) 
how the entity estimates repricing dates, including what interest rate assumptions underlie 
estimates of prepayment rates and the basis for changing those estimates. The same method is 
                                                             
2 
The same materiality considerations apply in this context as apply throughout Australian Accounting Standards. 
3 
The Standard permits an entity to designate any amount of the available qualifying assets or liabilities, ie in this example any amount of 
assets between CU0 and CU100.

the entity will test effectiveness for each repricing time period individually, for all time periods in 
aggregate, or by using some combination of the two. 
The policies specified in designating and documenting the hedging relationship shall be in accordance with 
the entity’s risk management procedures and objectives. Changes in policies shall not be made arbitrarily. 
They shall be justified on the basis of changes in market conditions and other factors and be founded on and 
consistent with the entity’s risk management procedures and objectives. 
AG120 
The hedging instrument referred to in paragraph AG114(e) may be a single derivative or a portfolio of 
derivatives all of which contain exposure to the hedged interest rate risk designated in paragraph AG114(d) 
(eg a portfolio of interest rate swaps all of which contain exposure to LIBOR). Such a portfolio of 
derivatives may contain offsetting risk positions. However, it may not include written options or net written 
options, because the Standard5 does not permit such options to be designated as hedging instruments (except 
when a written option is designated as an offset to a purchased option). If the hedging instrument hedges the 
amount designated in paragraph AG114(c) for more than one repricing time period, it is allocated to all of 
the time periods that it hedges. However, the whole of the hedging instrument must be allocated to those 
repricing time periods because the Standard6 does not permit a hedging relationship to be designated for 
only a portion of the time period during which a hedging instrument remains outstanding. 
AG121 
When the entity measures the change in the fair value of a prepayable item in accordance with paragraph 
AG114(g), a change in interest rates affects the fair value of the prepayable item in two ways: it affects the 
fair value of the contractual cash flows and the fair value of the prepayment option that is contained in a 
prepayable item. Paragraph 81 of the Standard permits an entity to designate a portion of a financial asset or 
financial liability, sharing a common risk exposure, as the hedged item, provided effectiveness can be 
measured. For prepayable items, paragraph 81A permits this to be achieved by designating the hedged item 
in terms of the change in the fair value that is attributable to changes in the designated interest rate on the 
basis of expected, rather than contractual, repricing dates. However, the effect that changes in the hedged 
interest rate have on those expected repricing dates shall be included when determining the change in the 
fair value of the hedged item. Consequently, if the expected repricing dates are revised (eg to reflect a 
change in expected prepayments), or if actual repricing dates differ from those expected, ineffectiveness 
will arise as described in paragraph AG126. Conversely, changes in expected repricing dates that (a) clearly 
arise from factors other than changes in the hedged interest rate, (b) are uncorrelated with changes in the 
hedged interest rate and (c) can be reliably separated from changes that are attributable to the hedged 
interest rate (eg changes in prepayment rates clearly arising from a change in demographic factors or tax 
regulations rather than changes in interest rate) are excluded when determining the change in the fair value 
of the hedged item, because they are not attributable to the hedged risk. If there is uncertainty about the 
factor that gave rise to the change in expected repricing dates or the entity is not able to separate reliably the 
changes that arise from the hedged interest rate from those that arise from other factors, the change is 
assumed to arise from changes in the hedged interest rate. 
AG122 
The Standard does not specify the techniques used to determine the amount referred to in paragraph 
AG114(g), namely the change in the fair value of the hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk. If 
statistical or other estimation techniques are used for such measurement, management must expect the result 
to approximate closely that which would have been obtained from measurement of all the individual assets 
or liabilities that constitute the hedged item. It is not appropriate to assume that changes in the fair value of 
the hedged item equal changes in the value of the hedging instrument. 
AG123 
Paragraph 89A requires that if the hedged item for a particular repricing time period is an asset, the change 
in its value is presented in a separate line item within assets. Conversely, if the hedged item for a particular 
repricing time period is a liability, the change in its value is presented in a separate line item within 
liabilities. These are the separate line items referred to in paragraph AG114(g). Specific allocation to 
individual assets (or liabilities) is not required.

APPENDIX A 
AG124 
Paragraph AG114(i) notes that ineffectiveness arises to the extent that the change in the fair value of the 
hedged item that is attributable to the hedged risk differs from the change in the fair value of the hedging 
derivative. Such a difference may arise for a number of reasons, including:  
(a) 
actual repricing dates being different from those expected, or expected repricing dates being 
revised; 
(b) 
items in the hedged portfolio becoming impaired or being derecognised; 
(c) 
the payment dates of the hedging instrument and the hedged item being different; and 
(d) 
other causes (eg when a few of the hedged items bear interest at a rate below the benchmark rate 
for which they are designated as being hedged, and the resulting ineffectiveness is not so great 
that the portfolio as a whole fails to qualify for hedge accounting). 
Such ineffectiveness7 shall be identified and recognised in profit or loss. 
AG125 
Generally, the effectiveness of the hedge will be improved:  
(a) 
if the entity schedules items with different prepayment characteristics in a way that takes account 
of the differences in prepayment behaviour. 
(b) 
when the number of items in the portfolio is larger. When only a few items are contained in the 
portfolio, relatively high ineffectiveness is likely if one of the items prepays earlier or later than 
expected. Conversely, when the portfolio contains many items, the prepayment behaviour can be 
predicted more accurately. 
(c) 
when the repricing time periods used are narrower (eg 1-month as opposed to 3-month repricing 
time periods). Narrower repricing time periods reduce the effect of any mismatch between the 
repricing and payment dates (within the repricing time period) of the hedged item and those of the 
hedging instrument. 
(d) 
the greater the frequency with which the amount of the hedging instrument is adjusted to reflect 
changes in the hedged item (eg because of changes in prepayment expectations). 
AG126 
An entity tests effectiveness periodically. If estimates of repricing dates change between one date on which 
an entity assesses effectiveness and the next, it shall calculate the amount of effectiveness either:  
(a) 
as the difference between the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument (see paragraph 
AG114(h)) and the change in the value of the entire hedged item that is attributable to changes in 
the hedged interest rate (including the effect that changes in the hedged interest rate have on the 
fair value of any embedded prepayment option); or 
(b) 
using the following approximation. The entity: 
(i) 
calculates the percentage of the assets (or liabilities) in each repricing time period that 
was hedged, on the basis of the estimated repricing dates at the last date it tested 
effectiveness. 
(ii) 
applies this percentage to its revised estimate of the amount in that repricing time 
period to calculate the amount of the hedged item based on its revised estimate. 
(iii) 
calculates the change in the fair value of its revised estimate of the hedged item that is 
attributable to the hedged risk and presents it as set out in paragraph AG114(g). 
(iv) 
recognises ineffectiveness equal to the difference between the amount determined in 
(iii) and the change in the fair value of the hedging instrument (see paragraph 
AG114(h)). 
AG127 
When measuring effectiveness, the entity distinguishes revisions to the estimated repricing dates of existing 
assets (or liabilities) from the origination of new assets (or liabilities), with only the former giving rise to 
ineffectiveness. All revisions to estimated repricing dates (other than those excluded in accordance with 
paragraph AG121), including any reallocation of existing items between time periods, are included when 
revising the estimated amount in a time period in accordance with paragraph AG126(b)(ii) and hence when 
measuring effectiveness. Once ineffectiveness has been recognised as set out above, the entity establishes a 
new estimate of the total assets (or liabilities) in each repricing time period, including new assets (or 
liabilities) that have been originated since it last tested effectiveness, and designates a new amount as the 
hedged item and a new percentage as the hedged percentage. The procedures set out in paragraph AG126(b) 
are then repeated at the next date it tests effectiveness.

The same materiality considerations apply in this context as apply throughout Australian Accounting Standards.

APPENDIX A 
AG128 
Items that were originally scheduled into a repricing time period may be derecognised because of earlier 
than expected prepayment or write-offs caused by impairment or sale. When this occurs, the amount of 
change in fair value included in the separate line item referred to in paragraph AG114(g) that relates to the 
derecognised item shall be removed from the statement of financial position, and included in the gain or 
loss that arises on derecognition of the item. For this purpose, it is necessary to know the repricing time 
period(s) into which the derecognised item was scheduled, because this determines the repricing time 
period(s) from which to remove it and hence the amount to remove from the separate line item referred to in 
paragraph AG114(g). When an item is derecognised, if it can be determined in which time period it was 
included, it is removed from that time period. If not, it is removed from the earliest time period if the 
derecognition resulted from higher than expected prepayments, or allocated to all time periods containing 
the derecognised item on a systematic and rational basis if the item was sold or became impaired. 
AG129 
In addition, any amount relating to a particular time period that has not been derecognised when the time 
period expires is recognised in profit or loss at that time (see paragraph 89A). For example, assume an 
entity schedules items into three repricing time periods. At the previous redesignation, the change in fair 
value reported in the single line item in the statement of financial position was an asset of CU25. That 
amount represents amounts attributable to periods 1, 2 and 3 of CU7, CU8 and CU10, respectively. At the 
next redesignation, the assets attributable to period 1 have been either realised or rescheduled into other 
periods. Therefore, CU7 is derecognised from the statement of financial position and recognised in profit or 
loss. CU8 and CU10 are now attributable to periods 1 and 2, respectively. These remaining periods are then 
adjusted, as necessary, for changes in fair value as described in paragraph AG114(g). 
AG130 
As an illustration of the requirements of the previous two paragraphs, assume that an entity scheduled assets 
by allocating a percentage of the portfolio into each repricing time period. Assume also that it scheduled 
CU100 into each of the first two time periods. When the first repricing time period expires, CU110 of assets 
are derecognised because of expected and unexpected repayments. In this case, all of the amount contained 
in the separate line item referred to in paragraph AG114(g) that relates to the first time period is removed 
from the statement of financial position, plus 10 per cent of the amount that relates to the second time 
period. 
AG131 
If the hedged amount for a repricing time period is reduced without the related assets (or liabilities) being 
derecognised, the amount included in the separate line item referred to in paragraph AG114(g) that relates 
to the reduction shall be amortised in accordance with paragraph 92. 
AG132 
An entity may wish to apply the approach set out in paragraphs AG114–AG131 to a portfolio hedge that 
had previously been accounted for as a cash flow hedge in accordance with AASB 139. Such an entity 
would revoke the previous designation of a cash flow hedge in accordance with paragraph 101(d), and 
apply the requirements set out in that paragraph. It would also redesignate the hedge as a fair value hedge 
and apply the approach set out in paragraphs AG114–AG131 prospectively to subsequent accounting 
periods. 
Transition (paragraphs 103–108C) 
AG133 
An entity may have designated a forecast intragroup transaction as a hedged item at the start of an annual 
period beginning on or after 1 January 2005 (or, for the purpose of restating comparative information, the 
start of an earlier comparative period) in a hedge that would qualify for hedge accounting in accordance 
with this Standard (as amended by the last sentence of paragraph 80). Such an entity may use that 
designation to apply hedge accounting in consolidated financial statements from the start of the annual 
period beginning on or after 1 January 2005 (or the start of the earlier comparative period). Such an entity 
shall also apply paragraphs AG99A and AG99B from the start of the annual period beginning on or after 
1 January 2005. However, in accordance with paragraph 108B, it need not apply paragraph AG99B to 
comparative information for earlier periods.

EXAMPLE 
Illustrative example 
This example accompanies, but is not part of, AASB 139. 
Facts 
IE1 
On 1 January 20X1, Entity A identifies a portfolio comprising assets and liabilities whose interest rate risk 
it wishes to hedge. The liabilities include demandable deposit liabilities that the depositor may withdraw at 
any time without notice. For risk management purposes, the entity views all of the items in the portfolio as 
fixed rate items.  
IE2 
For risk management purposes, Entity A analyses the assets and liabilities in the portfolio into repricing 
time periods based on expected repricing dates. The entity uses monthly time periods and schedules items 
for the next five years (ie it has 60 separate monthly time periods).8 The assets in the portfolio are 
prepayable assets that Entity A allocates into time periods based on the expected prepayment dates, by 
allocating a percentage of all of the assets, rather than individual items, into each time period. The portfolio 
also includes demandable liabilities that the entity expects, on a portfolio basis, to repay between one month 
and five years and, for risk management purposes, are scheduled into time periods on this basis. On the 
basis of this analysis, Entity A decides what amount it wishes to hedge in each time period. 
IE3 
This example deals only with the repricing time period expiring in three months’ time, ie the time period 
maturing on 31 March 20X1 (a similar procedure would be applied for each of the other 59 time periods). 
Entity A has scheduled assets of CU100 million9 and liabilities of CU80 million into this time period. All of 
the liabilities are repayable on demand.  
IE4 
Entity A decides, for risk management purposes, to hedge the net position of CU20 million and accordingly 
enters into an interest rate swap10 on 1 January 20X1 to pay a fixed rate and receive LIBOR, with a notional 
principal amount of CU20 million and a fixed life of three months.  
IE5 
This example makes the following simplifying assumptions:  
(a) 
the coupon on the fixed leg of the swap is equal to the fixed coupon on the asset; 
(b) 
the coupon on the fixed leg of the swap becomes payable on the same dates as the interest 
payments on the asset; and 
(c) 
the interest on the variable leg of the swap is the overnight LIBOR rate. As a result, the entire fair 
value change of the swap arises from the fixed leg only, because the variable leg is not exposed to 
changes in fair value due to changes in interest rates. 
In cases when these simplifying assumptions do not hold, greater ineffectiveness will arise. (The 
ineffectiveness arising from (a) could be eliminated by designating as the hedged item a portion of the cash 
flows on the asset that are equivalent to the fixed leg of the swap.) 
IE6 
It is also assumed that Entity A tests effectiveness on a monthly basis. 
IE7 
The fair value of an equivalent non-prepayable asset of CU20 million, ignoring changes in value that are not 
attributable to interest rate movements, at various times during the period of the hedge is as follows: 
 
 
1 Jan 
20X1

8 
In this example principal cash flows have been scheduled into time periods but the related interest cash flows have been included when 
calculating the change in the fair value of the hedged item. Other methods of scheduling assets and liabilities are also possible. Also, in 
this example, monthly repricing time periods have been used. An entity may choose narrower or wider time periods. 
9 
In this example monetary amounts are denominated in ‘currency units (CU)’. 
10 The example uses a swap as the hedging instrument. An entity may use forward rate agreements or other derivatives as hedging 
instruments.

Accounting treatment 
IE9 
On 1 January 20X1, Entity A designates as the hedged item an amount of CU20 million of assets in the 
three-month time period. It designates as the hedged risk the change in the value of the hedged item (ie the 
CU20 million of assets) that is attributable to changes in LIBOR. It also complies with the other designation 
requirements set out in paragraphs 88(d) and AG119 of the Standard.  
IE10 
Entity A designates as the hedging instrument the interest rate swap described in paragraph IE4.  
 
End of month 1 (31 January 20X1) 
IE11 
On 31 January 20X1 (at the end of month 1) when Entity A tests effectiveness, LIBOR has decreased. 
Based on historical prepayment experience, Entity A estimates that, as a consequence, prepayments will 
occur faster than previously estimated. As a result it re-estimates the amount of assets scheduled into this 
time period (excluding new assets originated during the month) as CU96 million.  
IE12 
The fair value of the designated interest rate swap with a notional principal of CU20 million is 
(CU47,408)11 (the swap is a liability).  
IE13 
Entity A computes the change in the fair value of the hedged item, taking into account the change in 
estimated prepayments, as follows.  
(a) 
First, it calculates the percentage of the initial estimate of the assets in the time period that was 
hedged. This is 20 per cent (CU20 million ÷ CU100 million). 
(b) 
Second, it applies this percentage (20 per cent) to its revised estimate of the amount in that time 
period (CU96 million) to calculate the amount that is the hedged item based on its revised 
estimate. This is CU19.2 million. 
(c) 
Third, it calculates the change in the fair value of this revised estimate of the hedged item 
(CU19.2 million) that is attributable to changes in LIBOR. This is CU45,511 (CU47,40812 × 
(CU19.2 million ÷ CU20 million)).

(a) 
This example does not show how amounts of interest income and interest expense are calculated. 
 
IE15 
The net result on profit or loss (excluding interest income and interest expense) is to recognise a loss of 
(CU1,897). This represents ineffectiveness in the hedging relationship that arises from the change in 
estimated prepayment dates. 
 
Beginning of month 2 
IE16 
On 1 February 20X1 Entity A sells a proportion of the assets in the various time periods. Entity A calculates 
that it has sold 81/3 per cent of the entire portfolio of assets. Because the assets were allocated into time 
periods by allocating a percentage of the assets (rather than individual assets) into each time period, Entity 
A determines that it cannot ascertain into which specific time periods the sold assets were scheduled. Hence 
it uses a systematic and rational basis of allocation. Based on the fact that it sold a representative selection 
of the assets in the portfolio, Entity A allocates the sale proportionately over all time periods. 
IE17 
On this basis, Entity A computes that it has sold 81/3 per cent of the assets allocated to the three-month time 
period, ie CU8 million (81/3 per cent of CU96 million). The proceeds received are CU8,018,400, equal to 
the fair value of the assets.13 On derecognition of the assets, Entity A also removes from the separate line 
item in the statement of financial position an amount that represents the change in the fair value of the 
hedged assets that it has now sold. This is 81/3 per cent of the total line item balance of CU45,511, ie 
CU3,793. 
IE18 
Entity A makes the following accounting entries to recognise the sale of the asset and the removal of part of 
the balance in the separate line item in the statement of financial position:

To recognise the sale of the asset at fair value and to recognise a gain on sale. 
 
Because the change in the amount of the assets is not attributable to a change in the hedged interest rate no 
ineffectiveness arises. 
IE19 
Entity A now has CU88 million of assets and CU80 million of liabilities in this time period. Hence the net 
amount Entity A wants to hedge is now CU8 million and, accordingly, it designates CU8 million as the 
hedged amount. 
IE20 
Entity A decides to adjust the hedging instrument by designating only a proportion of the original swap as 
the hedging instrument. Accordingly, it designates as the hedging instrument CU8 million or 40 per cent of 
the notional amount of the original swap with a remaining life of two months and a fair value of 
CU18,963.14  It also complies with the other designation requirements in paragraphs 88(a) and AG119 of 
the Standard. The CU12 million of the notional amount of the swap that is no longer designated as the 
hedging instrument is either classified as held for trading with changes in fair value recognised in profit or 
loss, or is designated as the hedging instrument in a different hedge.15 
IE21 
As at 1 February 20X1 and after accounting for the sale of assets, the separate line item in the statement of 
financial position is CU41,718 (CU45,511 – CU3,793), which represents the cumulative change in fair 
value of CU17.6 million16 of assets. However, as at 1 February 20X1, Entity A is hedging only CU8 million 
                                                             
13 The amount realised on sale of the asset is the fair value of a prepayable asset, which is less than the fair value of the equivalent non-
prepayable asset shown in paragraph IE7. 
14 CU47,408 × 40 per cent 
15 The entity could instead enter into an offsetting swap with a notional principal of CU12 million to adjust its position and designate as 
the hedging instrument all CU20 million of the existing swap and all CU12 million of the new offsetting swap.

EXAMPLE 
of assets that have a cumulative change in fair value of CU18,963.17 The remaining separate line item in the 
statement of financial position of CU22,75518 relates to an amount of assets that Entity A still holds but is 
no longer hedging. Accordingly Entity A amortises this amount over the remaining life of the time period, 
ie it amortises CU22,755 over two months.  
IE22 
Entity A determines that it is not practicable to use a method of amortisation based on a recalculated 
effective yield and hence uses a straight-line method.  
 
End of month 2 (28 February 20X1) 
IE23 
On 28 February 20X1 when Entity A next tests effectiveness, LIBOR is unchanged. Entity A does not 
revise its prepayment expectations. The fair value of the designated interest rate swap with a notional 
principal of CU8 million is (CU9,518)19 (the swap is a liability). Also, Entity A calculates the fair value of 
the CU8 million of the hedged assets as at 28 February 20X1 as CU8,009,518.20
