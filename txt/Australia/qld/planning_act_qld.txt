A planning instrument is an instrument that sets out policies
for planning or development assessment, and is either—
(a)
a State planning instrument; or
(b)
a local planning instrument.
(2)
A State planning instrument is a planning instrument made
by the Minister to protect or give effect to State interests, and
is either—
(a)
a State planning policy (including a temporary State
planning policy); or
(b)
a regional plan.
(3)
A local planning instrument is a planning instrument made
by a local government, and is either—

(c)
a planning scheme policy.
(4)
To the extent of any inconsistency—
(a)
a State planning policy applies instead of a regional plan
or local planning instrument; and
(b)
a regional plan applies instead of a local planning
instrument; and
(c)
a planning scheme applies instead of a planning scheme
policy; and
(d)
a TLPI applies instead of a planning scheme or planning
scheme policy.
Note—
A TLPI may also suspend, or otherwise affect, the operation of a
planning scheme or planning scheme policy—see section 23(3).
(5)
A local planning instrument must not include a provision
about building work, to the extent the building work is
regulated under the building assessment provisions, unless
allowed under the Building Act.
(6)
To the extent a local planning instrument does not comply
with subsection (5), the local planning instrument is of no
effect.
9
When planning instruments and designations have effect

day when the local government, at a public meeting, resolved
to give the TLPI or amendment, and the request for an earlier
effective day, to the Minister for approval.
(5)
Also, if under this chapter a planning instrument may be
repealed by a later planning instrument, the repeal starts to

This section applies if a local government—
(a)
makes, amends, extends or repeals a designation; or
(b)
receives a notice about the Minister making, amending,
extending or repealing a designation.
(2)
The local government must include a note about the making,
amendment, extension or repeal in—
(a)
the local government’s planning scheme; and

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[s 42A]
Planning Act 2016
Chapter 2 Planning

(b)
any planning scheme that the local government makes
before the designation stops having effect.
(3)
The note must—
(a)
identify the premises that were designated; and
(b)
describe the type of infrastructure for which the
premises were designated; and
(c)
state the day when the designation, amendment,
extension or repeal started to have effect.
(4)
The local government must include the note in the planning
scheme in a way that ensures the other provisions of the
scheme that apply to the designated premises remain effective.
(5)
To remove any doubt, it is declared that—
(a)
the note is not an amendment of a planning scheme; and
(b)
a designation is taken to be part of a planning scheme;
and
(c)
a designation is not the only way that a planning scheme
may identify infrastructure; and
(d)
a designation does not affect the provisions of a
planning scheme that apply to designated premises, even
after the designation stops having effect.
42A
Amending and repealing designations under old Act
To remove any doubt, it is declared that the Minister may,
under this part, amend or repeal a designation of land under
the old Act made by another Minister.

(2)
However, section 10(6) applies as if a reference in
section 10(6)(a)(i) to the day when the instrument was made
were a reference to the day the guidelines or designation
process rules, or the guidelines or rules as amended, took
effect.
(3)
Also, the Minister must comply with section 10(6), as applied
under 
subsection (2), 
immediately 
after 
a 
regulation
prescribes the guidelines or designation process rules or the
amended guidelines or rules.
(4)
In addition, if an amendment of the guidelines or designation
process rules is a minor amendment, section 10 does not apply
to the amendment.
(5)
If the Minister makes a minor amendment of the guidelines or
designation process rules, immediately after a regulation
prescribes the amended guidelines or rules, the Minister
must—
(a)
publish a public notice that states—
(i)
the day when the amendment took effect; and
(ii)
where a copy of the amended guidelines or rules
may be inspected or purchased; and
(b)
give a copy of the public notice, and the amended
guidelines or rules, to each affected local government.
(6)
The guidelines or designation process rules, or the amended
guidelines or rules, start to have effect when prescribed by
regulation.
(7)
In this section—
minor amendment, of the guidelines under section 36(3) or
the designation process rules under section 37, has the
meaning given by section 11(3) as if the guidelines or rules
were a State planning instrument.

Types of development and 
assessment
Division 1
Instruments and categories
43
Categorising instruments
(1)
A categorising instrument is a regulation or local
categorising instrument that does any or all of the following—
(a)
categorises development as prohibited, assessable or
accepted development;
(b)
specifies the categories of assessment required for
different types of assessable development;
(c)
sets out the matters (the assessment benchmarks) that
an assessment manager must assess assessable
development against.
(2)
An assessment benchmark does not include—
(a)
a matter of a person’s opinion; or
(b)
a person’s circumstances, financial or otherwise; or
(c)
for code assessment—a strategic outcome under
section 16(1)(a); or
(d)
a matter prescribed by regulation.
Examples of assessment benchmarks—
a code, a standard, or an expression of the intent for a zone or precinct
(3)
A local categorising instrument is—
(a)
a planning scheme; or
(b)
a TLPI; or
(c)
a variation approval, to the extent the variation approval
does any of the things mentioned in subsection (1).

Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel
(4)
A regulation made under subsection (1) applies instead of a
local categorising instrument, to the extent of any
inconsistency.
(5)
A local categorising instrument—
(a)
may state that development is prohibited development
only if a regulation allows the local categorising
instrument to do so; and
(b)
may not state that development is assessable
development if a regulation prohibits the local
categorising instrument from doing so; and
(c)
may not, in its effect, be inconsistent with the effect of a
specified assessment benchmark, or a specified part of
an assessment benchmark, identified in a regulation
made for this paragraph; and
Note—
Assessment benchmarks are given effect through the rules for assessing
and deciding development applications under section 45, 59 or 60.
(d)
may not include an assessment benchmark about the
effect or impact of development on the stated cultural
heritage significance of a Queensland heritage place.
(5A)
To remove any doubt, it is declared that subsection (5)(d)
applies even if the Queensland heritage place is also a local
heritage place.
(6)
To the extent a local categorising instrument does not comply
with subsection (5), the instrument has no effect.
(7)
A variation approval may do something mentioned in
subsection (1) only in relation to—
(a)
development that is the subject of the variation approval;
or
(b)
development 
that 
is 
the 
natural 
and 
ordinary
consequence of the development that is the subject of
the variation approval.

Categories of development
(1)
There are 3 categories of development, namely prohibited,
assessable or accepted development.
(2)
Prohibited development is development for which a
development application may not be made.

Assessable development is development for which a
development approval is required.
(4)
Accepted development is development for which a
development approval is not required.
(5)
A categorising instrument may categorise development.
(6)
However—
(a)
if no categorising instrument categorises particular
development—the 
development 
is 
accepted
development; and
(b)
development in relation to infrastructure under a
designation is—
(i)
to the extent the development is building work
under 
the 
Building 
Act—the 
category 
of
development stated for the building work under a
regulation; or
(ii)
otherwise—accepted development.
45
Categories of assessment
(1)
There are 2 categories of assessment for assessable
development, namely code and impact assessment.

(with or without changes) in a statutory instrument.
(7)
The assessment manager must assess the development
application against or having regard to the statutory
instrument, or other document, as in effect when the
development application was properly made.
(8)
However, the assessment manager may give the weight the
assessment manager considers is appropriate, in the
circumstances, to—
(a)
if the statutory instrument or other document is
amended or replaced after the development application
is properly made but before it is decided by the
assessment manager—the amended or replacement
instrument or document; or
(b)
another statutory instrument—
(i)
that comes into effect after the development
application is properly made but before it is
decided by the assessment manager; and
(ii)
that the assessment manager would have been
required to assess, or could have assessed, the
development application against, or having regard
to, if the instrument had been in effect when the
application was properly made.

(1)
A development approval is not required for assessable
development on premises if there is an exemption certificate
for the development.
(2)
The following persons may give an exemption certificate—

Development applications during stated period
(1)
If the material change of use of premises would, but for

material change of use of premises under this chapter as
if the declaration had not been made; and
(b)
this Act applies in relation to the application as if the

(b)
under 
section 72, 
the 
development 
under

having effect in relation to the premises, the material
change of use is carried out on the premises.
(5)
If the material change of use involved the start of a new use or

for the material change of use is not permitted to
start under section 72.
(2)
If the material change of use involved the start of a new use or
the re-establishment of a use on the premises—
(a)
the carrying out of the material change of use under the
declaration does not have the effect that the use is a
lawful use of the premises after the stated period ends;
and
(b)

Part 2
Development applications
Division 1
Introduction
47
What part is about
This part explains how a person makes a development
application to an assessment manager for a development
approval to carry out assessable development.
48
Who is the assessment manager
(1)
The assessment manager for a development application is the
person prescribed by regulation as the assessment manager for
the application.
(2)
Subject to part 6, division 3, the assessment manager for a
properly made application is responsible for—
(a)
administering and deciding the application; and
(b)
assessing all or part of the application.
(2A)
Without limiting subsection (1), a regulation may prescribe
that a person is the assessment manager for a development
application that is for part of a particular type of development.
Example—
For building work that must be assessed against the building assessment
provisions and is assessable development under a local government’s
planning scheme, a regulation may prescribe that—
(a) a private certifier is the assessment manager for a development
application for the part of the building work that must be assessed
against the building assessment provisions; and
(b) the local government is the assessment manager for a development
application for the part of the building work that is assessable
development under the planning scheme.
(2B)
Subsection (3) applies to a development application that—
(a)
is for development that requires code assessment only;
and

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[s 48]
Planning Act 2016
Chapter 3 Development assessment
Current as at 27 April 2025

(b)
does not include a variation request.
(3)
If—
(a)
a regulation prescribes a local government or the chief
executive (each the entity) to be the assessment manager
for the development application; and
(b)
the entity keeps a list of persons who are appropriately
qualified to be an assessment manager in relation to the
development the subject of the application; and
(c)
the entity has made or amended its code of conduct
under the Public Sector Ethics Act 1994 to apply the
code of conduct, including provisions about conflicts of
interest, to persons on the entity’s list; and
(d)
the entity has entered into an agreement with each
person on the entity’s list about the person’s functions as
an assessment manager that—
(i)
requires the person to comply with the code of
conduct; and
(ii)
provides for the entity to remove the person from
the entity’s list if the person fails to comply with
the code of conduct; and
(e)
a person on the entity’s list enters into an agreement
with another person to accept the development
application;
the person on the entity’s list is the assessment manager for
the development application instead of the prescribed
assessment manager for the application.
(4)
As soon as practicable after the person accepts the
application, the person must give a copy of the application to
the prescribed assessment manager.
(5)
If a person on an entity’s list of persons kept under
subsection (3) is removed from the list because the person has
not complied with an agreement under that subsection—
(a)
the entity immediately becomes the assessment
manager, instead of the person, for any development

application for which the person was the assessment
manager; and
(b)
no extra fee is payable for the application; and
(c)
the development assessment process for the application
continues from whichever of the following points in the
process is the earlier—
(i)
the point the application had reached immediately
before the person was replaced as the assessment
manager;
(ii)
10 business days before the day on which the
assessment manager is required, under the
development assessment rules, to decide the
application.
(6)
If a regulation does not prescribe who is the assessment
manager for a particular development application, the
Minister may—
(a)
decide who is the assessment manager; or
(b)
require the application to be split into 2 or more
applications.
(7)
If the Minister decides who is the assessment manager, the
Minister may—
(a)
decide that a person who could also have been the
assessment manager is instead to be a referral agency for
the application; and
(b)
impose limits on the referral agency’s powers (to the
power to only give advice, for example).
(8)
The Minister must give notice of the Minister’s decisions
under this section to—
(a)
the applicant; and
(b)
a person that the Minister decides is the assessment
manager; and
(c)
a person that the Minister decides is a referral agency.

development.
(3)
A development permit is the part of a decision notice for a
development application that authorises the carrying out of the
assessable development to the extent stated in the decision
notice.
(4)
Subject to section 66(2), a preliminary approval that is still in
effect applies instead of a later development permit for the
development, to the extent of any inconsistency, unless—
(a)
the development application for the development permit
states the way the development permit is to be
inconsistent with the preliminary approval; or
(b)
after the application for the development permit is made,
the applicant and, if the applicant is not the owner of the

If, under the Environmental Protection Act, section 115, a
development application is taken to be an application for an
environmental authority, the development application must
comply with section 125(1)(c) to (3) of that Act as if—
(a)
a reference to the application were a reference to a
development application; and
(b)
a reference to the applicant were a reference to an
applicant for a development application.
(4)
An assessment manager—
(a)
must accept an application that the assessment manager
is satisfied complies with subsections (1) to (3); and
(b)
must not accept an application unless the assessment
manager is satisfied the application complies with
subsections (2) and (3); and
(c)
may accept an application that does not comply with
subsection (1)(a) or (b)(i); and
(d)
may accept an application that does not comply with
subsection (1)(b)(ii) to the extent the required fee has

(5)
An application that complies with subsections (1) to (3), or
that the assessment manager accepts under subsection (4)(c)
or (d), is a properly made application.
52
Changing or withdrawing development applications
(1)
An applicant may change or withdraw a development
application, before the application is decided, by a notice
given to the assessment manager and, for a withdrawn
application, any referral agency.
(2)
However—
(a)
if the change is, or includes, a change of applicant, the
notice may be given by the person who proposes to
become the applicant if the notice is accompanied by the
consent of the current applicant; and
(b)
section 51(2) applies for making the change as though
the change were an application if—
(i)
the applicant no longer owns the premises or the
change is to include premises that the applicant
does not own; and
(ii)
were the application to be remade with the change,
section 51(2) would apply to the application; and
(c)
the change may not include prohibited development.
(3)
If the change is a minor change, the change does not affect the
development assessment process.
53
Publicly notifying certain development applications
(1)
An applicant must give notice of a development application
if—
(a)
any part of the application requires impact assessment;
or
(b)
the application includes a variation request.
(2)
The notice must be given in the way or ways stated in the
development assessment rules.

(3)
However, the assessment manager may assess and decide a
development application even if some of the requirements of
the development assessment rules about the notice have not
been complied with, if the assessment manager considers any
noncompliance has not—
(a)
adversely affected the public’s awareness of the
existence and nature of the application; or
(b)
restricted the public’s opportunity to make properly
made submissions about the application.
(4)
The notice must state that—
(a)
a person may make a submission about the application
to the assessment manager; and
(b)
any submission must be made by a stated day that is at
least—
(i)
for an application that includes a variation
request—30 business days after the notice is given;
or
(ii)
for an application of a type prescribed by
regulation—the period, of more than 15 business
days after the notice is given, prescribed for the
application; or
(iii) for any other application—15 business days after
the notice is given.
(5)
However, if the development assessment rules require the
notice to be given in more than 1 way, the period mentioned in
subsection (4)(b) starts on the day after the day when the last
notice is given.
(6)
Any person, other than the applicant or a referral agency, may
make a submission about the application.
Notes—
1
In order for a submitter to have appeal rights under schedule 1, the
submitter’s submission must be a properly made submission.
2
An advice agency, in its referral agency’s response, may tell the
assessment manager to treat the response as a properly made

submission. See schedule 2, definition eligible advice agency,
paragraph (a).
(7)
Submissions made about the application remain effective even
if the notice is given again under the development assessment
rules.
(8)
If, within 1 year after a development application (the original
application) lapses or is withdrawn, another development
application that is not substantially different from the original
application (the later application) is made, any properly made
submission for the original application is taken to be a
properly made submission for the later application.
(9)
This section applies even if a referral agency has directed
refusal of all or part of the development application.
(10)
The assessment manager may, at the applicant’s request, give
the notice for the applicant, for a fee of no more than the
reasonable costs of doing so.
(11)
However, subsection (1)(b) does not apply if—
(a)
a variation approval has been given for the premises;
and
(b)
the variation request does not seek to change the
category of development or category of assessment for
the development stated in the earlier variation approval
or, if the request does, the request seeks to change only 1
or more of the following—
(i)
accepted development to assessable development;
(ii)
assessable development requiring code assessment
to 
accepted 
development, 
if 
the 
accepted
development is substantially consistent with the
assessment benchmarks for the development under
the earlier variation approval;
(iii) assessable development requiring code assessment
to assessable development requiring impact
assessment; and
(c)
for a variation request that proposes assessment
benchmarks—the proposed assessment benchmarks are

a year and 5 January of the next year.
Part 3
Assessing and deciding 
development applications
Division 1
Referral agency’s assessment
54
Copy of application to referral agency
(1)
An applicant for a development application must, within the
period required under the development assessment rules, give
a copy of the application and, subject to section 109(b), the
required fee, to each referral agency.
(2)
A referral agency, for a development application, is—
(a)
the person prescribed by regulation as a referral agency
for applications of that type; or
(b)
if that person’s functions have been devolved or
delegated to another person—the other person; or
(c)
if the Minister has decided that a person is a referral
agency under section 48(7)—that person.
Note—
For additional referral agencies for change applications, other than
change applications for a minor change to a development approval, see
also section 82A.
(3)
However, if a person is the assessment manager for a
development application, and would be a referral agency for
the application because of subsection (2)—
(a)
the person is not a referral agency for the application,
but the person’s functions and powers as assessment

manager include those the person would have had as a
referral agency; and
(b)
the person’s fee for the development application
includes the fee under subsection (1).
(4)
Despite subsection (1), the applicant need not give a copy of
the application to a referral agency if—
(a)
the applicant gave the assessment manager the referral
agency’s response stated in section 57(3) with the
application; and
(b)
the referral agency’s response states that—
(i)
the referral agency does not require the applicant to
give a copy to the agency; or
(ii)
the referral agency does not require the applicant to
give a copy to the agency if stated conditions,
including a time limit within which the application
must be made, are satisfied; and
(c)
any conditions stated in paragraph (b)(ii) are satisfied.
(5)
The assessment manager may, if asked by the applicant, give a
copy of the application to a referral agency for the applicant,
for a fee of no more than the reasonable costs of doing so.
55
Referral agency’s assessment
(1)
A referral agency decided by the Minister under section 48(7)
must assess a development application as required under
section 45, as if the agency were the assessment manager.
(2)
For any other referral agency, a regulation may prescribe the
matters the referral agency—
(a)
may, must, or must only assess a development
application against; and
(b)
may, must, or must only have regard to for the
assessment.
Note—
See also sections 82A and 275ZJ.

Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel
(3)
Subsections (4) and (5) apply if a referral agency is, under
subsection (2), assessing a development application against or
having regard to—
(a)
a statutory instrument; or
(b)
another document applied, adopted or incorporated
(with or without changes) in a statutory instrument.
(4)
The referral agency must assess the development application
against or having regard to the statutory instrument, or other
document, as in effect when the development application was
properly made.
(5)
However, the referral agency may give the weight the referral
agency considers is appropriate, in the circumstances, to—
(a)
if the statutory instrument or other document is
amended or replaced after the development application
is properly made— the amended or replacement
instrument or document; or
(b)
another statutory instrument—
(i)
that comes into effect after the development
application is properly made; and
(ii)
that the referral agency would have been required
to assess, or could have assessed, the development
application against, or having regard to, if the
instrument had been in effect when the application
was properly made.
56
Referral agency’s response
(1)
After assessing the development application, the referral
agency must decide—
(a)
to tell the assessment manager that the agency has no
requirements for the application; or
(b)
to direct the assessment manager to do any or all of the
following—

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[s 56]
Planning Act 2016

(i)
to give any development approval subject to stated
development conditions;
(ii)
to give any development approval for only a stated
part of the application;
(iii) to give any development approval only as a
preliminary approval;
(iv) to impose a stated currency period for a
development approval given; or
(c)
to direct the assessment manager to refuse the
application for stated reasons.
(2)
However, to the extent the application is a variation request,
the referral agency must, instead of a decision under
subsection (1), decide—
(a)
to tell the assessment manager that the agency has no
requirements for the variation request; or
(b)
to direct the assessment manager to do any or all of the
following—
(i)
to approve only some of the variations sought;
(ii)
subject to section 61(3)—to approve different
variations from those sought; or
(c)
to direct the assessment manager to refuse the variation
request.
(3)
The referral agency may give advice about the application to
the assessment manager.
(4)
The referral agency must give a notice (a referral agency’s
response) about the referral agency’s decision to—
(a)
the applicant; and
(b)
the assessment manager.
(5)
A regulation may limit the powers of a referral agency (to the
power to only give advice, for example).
(6)
If—
(a)
the referral agency is—

(i)
the chief executive; or
(ii)
an entity prescribed by regulation; and
(b)
to the extent the referral agency’s assessment involves
development other than development prescribed by
regulation;
the referral agency must publish a notice about the referral
agency’s decision on the referral agency’s website.
(7)
The notice must state—
(a)
a description of the development to which the referral
agency’s assessment relates; and
(b)
a description of the matters under section 55(2) that the
referral agency assessed the development against, and
had regard to; and
(c)
the reasons for the referral agency’s decision; and
(d)
any matter prescribed by regulation.
57
Response before application
(1)
Sections 55 and 56 apply to the extent a response is given
before a proposed development application is made, by a
person who would, if the application were made, be a referral
agency.
(2)
However, a reference in section 55 to when the application
was properly made is a reference to the day the proposed
applicant first gave the person documents in relation to the
proposed development application.
(3)
If the application—
(a)
is the same or is not substantially different from the
proposed application; and
(b)
is made within the time, if any, stated in the response;
the response is, or is part of, the person’s referral agency’s
response for the application.

(4)
The proposed applicant must, if asked, and subject to
section 109(b), pay the person the required fee for the referral,
even if there is no application.
(5)
A fee under section 54(1) for the part of the application
relating to a response under this section does not have to be
paid again for the application.
58
Effect of no response
(1)
If a referral agency does not comply with section 56(4) before
the end of the period stated in the development assessment
rules for complying with that section (the stated period), the
agency is taken to have given a response that the agency has
no requirements for, or advice about, the application.
(2)
However, subsection (1) is subject to—
(a)
any other provision of the development assessment
rules, to the extent the other provision affects when the
stated period would otherwise end; and
Examples of what other provisions may provide for—
•
extending the period for giving a referral agency’s response
•
giving a late referral agency’s response
•
changing a referral agency’s response before the application
is decided
•
reviving a development application after a contravention of
the development assessment rules
(b)
section 99; and
(c)
another effect of not giving a referral agency’s response
prescribed under a regulation for a matter.
Division 2
Assessment manager’s decision

What this division is about
(1)
This division is about deciding properly made applications,
including variation requests.

(2)
An assessment manager must follow the development
assessment process for the application even if a referral
agency’s response directs the assessment manager to refuse
the application.
(3)
Subject to section 62, the assessment manager’s decision must
be based on the assessment of the development carried out by
the assessment manager.
60
Deciding development applications
(1)
This section applies to a properly made application, other than
a part of a development application that is a variation request.
(2)
To the extent the application involves development that
requires code assessment, and subject to section 62, the
assessment manager, after carrying out the assessment—
(a)
must decide to approve the application to the extent the
development complies with all of the assessment
benchmarks for the development; and
(b)
may decide to approve the application even if the
development does not comply with some of the
assessment benchmarks; and
Examples—
1
An assessment manager may approve an application for
development that does not comply with some of the
benchmarks if the decision resolves a conflict between the
benchmarks.
2
An assessment manager may approve an application for
development that does not comply with some of the
benchmarks if the decision resolves a conflict between the
benchmarks and a referral agency’s response.
(c)
may impose development conditions on an approval;
and
(d)
may, to the extent the development does not comply
with some or all the assessment benchmarks, decide to
refuse the application only if compliance can not be
achieved by imposing development conditions.

Example of a development condition—
a development condition that affects the way the development is
carried out, or the management of uses or works that are the
natural and ordinary consequence of the development, but does
not have the effect of changing the type of development applied
for
(3)
To the extent the application involves development that
requires impact assessment, and subject to section 62, the
assessment manager, after carrying out the assessment, must
decide—
(a)
to approve all or part of the application; or
(b)
to approve all or part of the application, but impose
development conditions on the approval; or
(c)
to refuse the application.
(4)
The assessment manager must approve any part of the
application for which, were that part of the application the
subject of a separate development application, there would be
a different assessment manager—
(a)
other than to the extent a referral agency for the
development application directs the refusal of the part
under section 56(1)(c); and
(b)
subject to any requirements of the referral agency under
56(1)(b).
(5)
The assessment manager may give a preliminary approval for
all or part of the development application, even though the
development application sought a development permit.
(6)
If an assessment manager approves only part of a
development application, the rest is taken to be refused.
61
Assessing and deciding variation requests
(1)
This section applies to a part of a properly made application
that is a variation request.
(2)
When assessing the variation request, the assessment manager
must consider—

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[s 62]
Planning Act 2016
Chapter 3 Development assessment
Current as at 27 April 2025
Page 91
Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel
(a)
the result of the assessment of that part of the
development application that is not the variation request;
and
(b)
the consistency of the variations sought with the rest of
the local planning instrument that is sought to be varied;
and
(c)
the effect the variations would have on submission
rights for later development applications, particularly
considering the amount and detail of information
included in, attached to, or given with the application
and available to submitters; and
(d)
any other matter prescribed by regulation.
(3)
The assessment manager must decide—
(a)
to approve—
(i)
all or some of the variations sought; or
(ii)
different variations from those sought; or
(b)
to refuse the variations sought.
Note—
The part of a variation approval that approves variations is a local
categorising instrument. Section 43(7) states limits on the variation
approval as a categorising instrument.
62
Complying with referral agency’s responses
Other than to the extent a referral agency’s response provides
advice, an assessment manager’s decision must—
(a)
comply with all referral agency’s responses; and
(b)
if a referral agency’s response requires conditions to be
imposed on a development approval—include the
conditions exactly as stated in the response.
63
Notice of decision

(a)
if an appeal about the approval is started, and subject to
the outcome of the appeal—the approval starts to have
effect when the appeal ends; or
(b)
if no appeal about the approval is started, but there was a
submitter for the development application who had not
given the assessment manager a notice withdrawing the
submitter’s submission before the application was
decided—the approval starts to have effect on the day
after the first of the following happens—
(i)
the last submitter gives the assessment manager
notice that the submitter will not be appealing the
decision;
(ii)
the last appeal period for the development approval
ends.
(3)
If a submitter for the development application gives the

(a)
the appeal ends; or
(b)
the tribunal or court hearing the appeal allows all or part
of the development to start, because the tribunal or court
considers the outcome of the appeal would not be
affected.
73

(a)
attaches to the premises, even if—
(i)
a later development (including reconfiguring a lot)
is approved for the premises; or

Minister may refer the change application to the assessment
manager.

Development approval conditions 
about trunk infrastructure
Subdivision 1
Conditions for necessary trunk 
infrastructure
127
Application and operation of subdivision
(1)
This subdivision applies if—
(a)
trunk infrastructure—
(i)
has not been provided; or
(ii)
has been provided but is not adequate; and
(b)
the trunk infrastructure is or will be located on—
(i)
premises (the subject premises) that are the subject
of a development application, whether or not the
infrastructure is necessary to service the subject
premises; or
(ii)
other premises, but is necessary to service the
subject premises.
(2)
Section 128 provides for the local government to be able to
impose particular development conditions (each a necessary
infrastructure condition) on the development approval.
Note—
For imposing or amending development conditions in relation to an
approval of a change application, see sections 81A(2)(a) and 82(3)(b).
128
Necessary infrastructure conditions
(1)
If the LGIP identifies adequate trunk infrastructure to service
the subject premises, the local government may impose a
development condition requiring either or both of the
following to be provided at a stated time—
(a)
the identified infrastructure;

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[s 129]
Planning Act 2016
Chapter 4 Infrastructure
Page 180
 Current as at 27 April 2025
Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel
(b)
different trunk infrastructure delivering the same desired
standard of service.
(2)
If the LGIP does not identify adequate trunk infrastructure to
service the subject premises, the local government may
impose a development condition requiring development
infrastructure necessary to service the premises to be provided
at a stated time.
(3)
However, a local government may impose a condition under
subsection (2) only if the development infrastructure services
development consistent with the assumptions in the LGIP
about type, scale, location or timing of development.
(4)
A necessary infrastructure condition is taken to comply with
section 65(1) if—
(a)
generally, the infrastructure required is the most
efficient and cost-effective solution for servicing other
premises in the general area of the subject premises; and
(b)
for a necessary infrastructure condition that requires the
provision of the infrastructure located on the subject
premises—
(i)
the provision is not an unreasonable imposition on
the development; or
(ii)
the provision is not an unreasonable imposition on
the use of the subject premises as a consequence of
the development.
(5)
To remove any doubt, it is declared that a necessary
infrastructure condition may be imposed for infrastructure
even if the infrastructure will service premises other than the
subject premises.
129
Offset or refund requirements
(1)
This section applies if—
(a)
trunk infrastructure that is the subject of a necessary
infrastructure condition services, or is planned to
service, premises other than the subject premises; and

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[s 130]
Planning Act 2016
Chapter 4 Infrastructure
Current as at 27 April 2025
Page 181
Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel
(b)
an adopted charge applies to the development.
(2)
If the cost of the infrastructure required to be provided under
the condition is equal to or less than the amount worked out
by applying the adopted charge to the development, the cost
must be offset against that amount.
Note—
For how the cost is worked out, see sections 116 and 137.
Example—
A necessary infrastructure condition of a development approval
requires transport infrastructure to be provided. The cost of the
transport infrastructure is $500,000. Adopted charges apply to the
development at a total amount of $600,000. The cost of the
infrastructure under the necessary infrastructure condition ($500,000)
must be offset against the total amount worked out by applying the
adopted charge to the development ($600,000), rather than offsetting it
only against the part of the charge relating to transport infrastructure.
(3)
If the cost of the infrastructure required to be provided under
the condition is more than the amount worked out by applying
the adopted charge to the development—
(a)
no amount is payable for the development approval; and
(b)
the local government must refund to the applicant the
difference between the establishment cost of the trunk
infrastructure and the amount worked out by applying
the adopted charge to the development.
Subdivision 2
Conditions for extra trunk 
infrastructure costs
130
Imposing development conditions
(1)
A local government may impose a development condition (an
extra payment condition) requiring the payment of extra
trunk infrastructure costs if—
(a)
the development—

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[s 131]
Planning Act 2016
Chapter 4 Infrastructure
Page 182
 Current as at 27 April 2025
Authorised by the Parliamentary Counsel
(i)
will generate infrastructure demand of more than
that required to service the type or scale of future
development that the LGIP assumes; or
(ii)
will require new trunk infrastructure earlier than
when identified in the LGIP; or
(iii) is for premises completely or partly outside the
PIA; and
(b)
the 
development 
would 
impose 
extra 
trunk
infrastructure costs on the local government after taking
into account either or both of the following—
(i)
levied charges for the development;
(ii)
trunk infrastructure provided, or to be provided, by
the applicant under this part.
(2)
However, an extra payment condition must not be imposed for
a State infrastructure provider.
(3)
An extra payment condition is taken to comply with
section 65(1) to the extent the infrastructure is necessary, but
not yet available, to service the development.
(4)
Subsection (3) applies even if the infrastructure is also
intended to service other development.
(5)
The power to impose an extra payment condition is subject to
sections 131 to 136.
131
Content of extra payment condition
(1)
An extra payment condition must state—
(a)
the reason why the condition was imposed; and
(b)
the amount of the payment to be made under the
condition; and
(c)
details of the trunk infrastructure for which the payment
is required; and
(d)
the time (the payment time) when the amount becomes
payable; and

(e)
the applicant may, instead of making the payment, elect
to provide all or part of the trunk infrastructure; and
(f)
if the applicant so elects—
(i)
any 
requirements 
for 
providing 
the 
trunk
infrastructure; and
(ii)
when the trunk infrastructure must be provided.
(2)
Unless the applicant and the local government otherwise
agree, the payment time is—
(a)
if the trunk infrastructure is necessary to service the
premises—by the day the development, or works
associated with the development, starts; or
(b)
otherwise—
(i)
if the extra payment condition applies for
reconfiguring a lot—when the local government
approves a plan for the reconfiguration that, under
the Land Title Act, is required to be given to the
local government for approval; or
(ii)
if the extra payment condition applies for building
work—when the final inspection certificate for the
building work, or the certificate of occupancy for
the building, is given under the Building Act; or
(iii) if the extra payment condition applies for a
material change of use—when the change happens.
132
Restriction if development completely in PIA
(1)
This section applies to an extra payment condition that a local
government imposes for development completely inside the
PIA.
(2)
The extra payment condition may require a payment only as
follows—
(a)
for trunk infrastructure to be provided earlier than
planned in the LGIP—the extra establishment cost that

earlier than planned;
(b)
for infrastructure associated with a different type or
scale of development from that assumed in the
LGIP—the establishment cost of any extra trunk
infrastructure made necessary by the development.
133
Extra payment conditions for development outside PIA
An extra payment condition that a local government imposes
for development completely or partly outside the PIA may
require the payment of—
(a)
the establishment cost of trunk infrastructure that is—
(i)
made necessary by the development; and
(ii)
if the local government’s planning scheme
indicates the premises are part of an area intended
for future development for purposes other than
rural or rural residential purposes—necessary to
service the rest of the area; and
(b)
either or both of the following establishment costs of
any temporary trunk infrastructure—
(i)
costs required to ensure the safe or efficient
operation of infrastructure needed to service the
development;
(ii)
costs made necessary by the development; and
(c)
any decommissioning, removal and rehabilitation costs
of the temporary infrastructure; and
(d)
the maintenance and operating costs for up to 5 years of
the infrastructure and temporary infrastructure as stated
in paragraphs (a) and (b).

Refund if development in PIA
(1)
This section applies to an extra payment condition that a local
government imposes for development completely inside the
PIA.
(2)
The local government must refund the payer the proportion of
the establishment cost of the infrastructure that—
(a)
may be apportioned reasonably to other users of the
infrastructure; and
(b)
has been, is, or is to be, the subject of a levied charge by
the local government.
135
Refund if development approval stops

payment the local government has not spent, or contracted to
spend, on designing and constructing the infrastructure.
(3)
The timing of the refund is subject to terms agreed between
the payer and local government.
136
Extra payment condition does not affect other powers
To remove any doubt, it is declared that the imposition of an
extra payment condition does not prevent a local government
from—
(a)
adopting charges for trunk infrastructure and levying
charges; or
(b)
imposing a condition for non-trunk infrastructure; or

land would help to achieve the outcomes stated in a
local planning instrument; or
(b)
after a development approval starts to have effect, the
local government is satisfied—
(i)
the development would create a need to construct
infrastructure on land or to carry drainage over
land; and

For subsection (1)(b), it does not matter that the person with
the benefit of the approval may derive a measurable benefit
from the action.

If the Governor in Council, by order in council, approves the
taking or purchasing, the local government is taken to be a
constructing authority under the Acquisition Act and may take
or purchase the land under that Act, including by taking an
easement.
Note—
For the ways of taking land, see the Acquisition Act, part 2. For
compensation for land taken under that Act, see part 4 of that Act.
