115B
Meaning of community titles scheme
(1)
A community titles scheme is—
(a)
a single community management statement recorded by
the registrar identifying land (the scheme land); and
(b)
the scheme land.
(2)
Land may be identified as scheme land if it consists of—
(a)
2 or more lots; and
(b)
other land (the common property for the community
titles scheme) that is not included in a lot mentioned in
paragraph (a).
(3)
Land can not be common property for more than 1 community
titles scheme.
(4)
For each community titles scheme, there must be—
(a)
at least 2 lots; and
(b)
common property; and
(c)
a single body corporate; and
(d)
a single community management statement.
(5)
A community titles scheme is a basic scheme if all the lots
mentioned in subsection (2)(a) are lots under this Act.
(6)
However, under this part, a lot may be, for its inclusion in a
community titles scheme other than a basic scheme, another
community titles scheme.
Note—
BCCM Act, schedule 1 (Illustrations) contains examples of possible
structures of community titles schemes.
115C
Meaning of layered arrangement of community titles 
schemes
(1)
A layered arrangement of community titles schemes is a
grouping of community titles schemes—

(a)
in which there is 1 community titles scheme (the
principal scheme) that—
Note—
See BCCM Act, schedule 1, parts 2 and 3 for examples of
layered arrangements of community titles schemes.
(i)
is not a lot included in another community titles
scheme; and
(ii)
is made up of—
(A)
the scheme land for all other community
titles schemes in the grouping; and
(B)
its own common property; and
(C)
each lot, if any, that is not a community titles
scheme, but that is included in the scheme;
and
(b)
in which there is at least 1 basic scheme; and
(c)
in which there may or may not be 1 or more community
titles schemes located between the principal scheme and
each basic scheme.
(2)
Each community titles scheme, other than the principal
scheme, in a layered arrangement of community titles
schemes—
(a)
is a subsidiary scheme for the principal scheme; and
(b)
unless it is a lot included in the principal scheme, may
also be a subsidiary scheme for another community
titles scheme forming part of the layered arrangement.
(3)
A subsidiary scheme, for a community titles scheme (scheme
A), is a community titles scheme the scheme land for which
forms part of the scheme land for scheme A.
(4)
In this Act, the expression included in, if used in the context
of the inclusion of a lot in a community titles scheme—
(a)
establishes the relationship the lot has to the scheme;

(b)
in general terms, is used to establish that the lot is
directly a part of the scheme, rather than only indirectly
a part of the scheme.
(5)
The diagram and notes in the BCCM Act, schedule 1, part 3
illustrate more comprehensively how the expression ‘included
in’ is used.
115D
Provisions about lots that are community titles schemes
If a community titles scheme (scheme A) includes a lot that is
another community titles scheme (scheme B)—
(a)
a reference in this Act to the owner of the lot is a
reference to the body corporate for scheme B; but
(b)
a reference in this Act to a lot included in scheme A
does not include a reference to scheme B if the provision
is about—
(i)
the subdivision of a lot; or
(ii)
the indefeasible title for a lot; or
(iii) a lease or mortgage of a lot; or
(iv) the occupier or registered proprietor of a lot.

Scheme land
115H
Single area for scheme land
(1)
Scheme land for a community titles scheme must be made up
of a single, continuous area of land.
(2)
Scheme land is taken to be made up of a single, continuous
area of land even if—
(a)
a lot is subdivided under section 53A; or
(b)
if paragraph (a) does not apply—there is nevertheless a
road or watercourse within the external boundaries of
the scheme land.
(3)
However, a community titles scheme may be established with
scheme land not made up of a single, continuous area of land
if all lots that become the scheme land are—
(a)
created under a single plan of subdivision; or
(b)
in the opinion of the registrar formed on reasonable
grounds, located within an area that is sufficiently
limited to ensure the scheme can be administered under
the BCCM Act efficiently and effectively as a single
scheme.
(4)
Nevertheless, if subsection (3) applies, and the scheme is later
changed to include additional lots or common property, each
of the additional lots or common property must form a single,
continuous area of land with a part of the scheme land in
existence for the scheme immediately before the inclusion of
the additional lots or common property.

under a contract for the sale of the lot.
123
Notifying caveat
The registrar must give written notice of the lodgement of a
caveat to each person mentioned in section 121(2)(c)(i) and
(ii).
124
Effect of lodging caveat
(1)
A caveat prevents registration of an instrument affecting the
lot over which the caveat is lodged from the date and time
endorsed by the registrar on the caveat as the caveat’s date and
time of lodgement.
(1A)
Subsection (1) has effect for a caveat until the caveat lapses or

(a)
an instrument specified in the caveat as an instrument to
which the caveat does not apply;
(b)
an instrument if the caveator consents to its registration;
(c)
an instrument executed by a mortgagee whose interest
was registered before lodgement of the caveat if—

the caveator claims an interest in the lot as security
for the payment of money or money’s worth;

an instrument of transfer of mortgage executed by a
mortgagee whose interest was registered before

Example—
A caveat lodged by a person who has the benefit of an order
mentioned in section 122(1)(e) restrains the registered owner of
a lot from transferring or mortgaging the lot. The lodgement of
the caveat does not prevent registration of an instrument of lease
for the lot.
(f)
another interest that, if registered, will not affect the
interest claimed by the caveator.
(3)
The exceptions mentioned in subsection (2)(c) and (d) do not
apply to a caveat lodged by the registrar.
(4)
The exception in subsection (2)(d) does not apply to a caveat
lodged by the registered owner.
(5)
Lodgement of a caveat does not create in the caveator a
registrable interest in the lot affected by the caveat.
125
Withdrawing a caveat
A caveator may withdraw a caveat by lodging a request to
withdraw it.
126
Lapsing of caveat
(1)

section 122(1)(d) or (e) is deposited when the caveat is
lodged; or

(e)
it is lodged other than under this division.
(1A)
However, this section applies to a caveat lodged by the
registered owner of a lot if— 
(a)
the lot is subject to a mortgage; and

mortgage; or
(ii)
the mortgagee’s power of sale.
(2)
The caveatee of a caveat to which this section applies—
(a)

paragraph (a)—must, within 14 days after the notice is
served, deposit an instrument notifying the registrar of
the service of the notice.
(4)
If a caveator does not want a caveat to which this section
applies to lapse, the caveator must—
(a)
start a proceeding in a court of competent jurisdiction to
establish the interest claimed under the caveat—
(i)
if the caveatee has served a notice under
subsection (2)(a) on the caveator and has complied
with subsection (2)(b)—within 14 days after the

or otherwise satisfied; or
(c)
the nature of the interest claimed does not entitle the
caveator to prevent registration of an instrument that has

order mentioned in section 122(1)(e)—the proceeding
in which the order was made has been discontinued or

section 124(2)(c) applies to allow the registration of the
instrument.
(4)
Also, the registrar may cancel a caveat lodged by a person
who has the benefit of an order mentioned in section 122(1)(e)
if—

in relation to an interest.
(2)
A further caveat with the same caveator can never be lodged
in relation to the interest on the same, or substantially the
same, grounds as the grounds stated in the original caveat
