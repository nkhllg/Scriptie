(d)
the lessee is a seller under the contract of sale.

Purpose of division
(1)
This division provides for the classifying of tenancies of
moveable dwelling premises as either short or long tenancies.
(2)
For some matters, the way this Act applies to a residential
tenancy of moveable dwelling premises depends on whether
the tenancy is a short or long tenancy.

tenancy (moveable dwelling), but does not apply to a short tenancy
(moveable dwelling).
2

different times depending on whether the tenancy is a long tenancy
(moveable dwelling) or short tenancy (moveable dwelling).
47

If the lessor and tenant intend that the tenant’s occupation of
the premises is not to continue for more than 42 days (the base
period), they may make a written statement to that effect (the
short tenancy statement).

the tenancy for another period stated in the statement (the
extended period) in the same way it applies during the base
period.
(2)
A short tenancy (extension) statement may only be made in
the base period.
(3)
Only 1 short tenancy (extension) statement may be made
about the tenancy.
(4)
The extended period may not be more than 42 days.
49
Setting aside short tenancy (extension) statements
(1)
If the parties made a short tenancy (extension) statement, the
tenant may apply to a tribunal for an order setting aside the
statement because the lessor exerted undue influence on the
tenant to make the statement.
(2)
The tribunal may make the order if it is satisfied the tenant has
established the ground of the application.
50
Short tenancies
For any period for which a short tenancy statement or short
tenancy (extension) statement applies to the tenancy, the
tenancy is a short tenancy (moveable dwelling).
51
Long tenancies
If the tenancy is not a short tenancy (moveable dwelling), it is
a long tenancy (moveable dwelling).

184E Grounds for refusing pets being kept at premises
(1)
The following are the only grounds for a lessor to refuse a

animals being kept at the premises;
(b)
the premises are unsuitable for keeping the pet because
of a lack of appropriate fencing, open space or another
thing necessary to humanely accommodate the pet;
(c)
keeping the pet is likely to cause damage to the premises
or inclusions that could not practicably be repaired for a
cost that is less than the amount of the rental bond for
the premises;
(d)
keeping the pet would pose an unacceptable risk to the
health and safety of a person, including, for example,
because the pet is venomous;
(e)
keeping the pet would contravene a law;
(f)
keeping the pet would contravene a body corporate
by-law or park rule applying to the premises;
(g)
the tenant has not agreed to the reasonable conditions
proposed by the lessor for approval to keep the pet;
(h)
the animal stated in the request is not a pet;
(i)
if

condition of a licence applying to the premises;

premises;

if the pet is capable of carrying parasites that could
infest the premises—a condition requiring the premises
