applies to the building work only if the chief executive
considers the general safety and structural standards of the
relevant building or structure would not be at risk.

Part 6
Regulation of building 
assessment work and the 
issuing of building 
development approvals by 
private certifiers
82
Application of pt 6
This part applies if, under section 48, a private certifier (class
A) is assessing a building development application or
deciding and issuing the decision notice.
83
General restrictions on granting building development 
approval
(1)
The private certifier must not grant the building development
approval applied for—
(a)
until, under the Planning Act and the Economic
Development Act 2012, all necessary development
permits and PDA development permits are effective for
development, other than building work, that may affect
any or all of the following—
(i)
the form or location of the building work;
(ii)
the use of the building or other structure;
(iii) the assessment of the building development
application; and
Example—
A proposal involving building work also involves a material
change of use, reconfiguring a lot and operational work under
the Planning Act. The material change of use, reconfiguring a lot
and operational work are categorised as assessable development
under the Planning Act. The private certifier is engaged to carry
out building assessment work and decide the building
development application. The private certifier must not grant the

building development approval applied for until, under the
Planning Act, all necessary development permits are effective
for—
•
the material change of use, which will affect the use of the
building or other structure
•
reconfiguring the lot, which will affect the location of the
building work on the reconfigured lot
•
the operational work, other than operational work that does
not affect the form or location of the building work or
assessment of the building development application,
including, for example, landscaping work.
(b)
if the building development application is for a
development permit that, under the Planning Act,
section 73A, does not authorise the carrying out of a
part of the building work unless a relevant preliminary
approval is in effect for the part—
(i)
until the relevant preliminary approval is in effect
for the part; or
(ii)
until a development permit given by an entity other
than a private certifier is in effect for the part; and
Example—
A building development application is made for a development
permit for building work that must be assessed against the
building assessment provisions and a code in the local
government’s planning scheme. The code is not a building
assessment provision and none of the referral agencies for the
application are required, under the Planning Act, to assess the
application against, or having regard to, the code. A private
certifier is engaged to assess and decide the building
development application. The private certifier must not grant the
development permit until either of the following is in effect for
the part of the building work that must be assessed against the
code—
(a) a preliminary approval given by the local government under
the repealed Sustainable Planning Act 2009; or
(b) a development permit given by the local government.
(ba) if the building development application is for a
development permit for building work and a part of the
building work is PDA-related development that is PDA

the referral agency has given its referral agency’s
response to the private certifier or, if the referral
agency does not give a response before the end of
the referral agency’s response period for the
application, until after the response period has
ended; and
(ii)
if the referral agency is the local government—any
security it has required for the carrying out of the
building work has been given; and
(e)
if proposed works relating to the development include
installing or altering on premises an on-site sewage
facility under the Plumbing and Drainage Act
2018—until a permit under that Act has been given for
the installation or alteration.
Maximum penalty—165 penalty units.
(2)
Subsection (3) applies if the private certifier receives the
application before a following application or request is
decided—

Example

classification 
or 
use 
change 
for
paragraph (a)(ii)—
