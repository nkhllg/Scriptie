the subdivision of the title to a larger portion of land into separate titles for

the insurer must take reasonable steps to ensure that the contract is not a 
prescribed contract in respect of loss caused to a business that would, at that 
time, be a small business.

The insurer is likely to rely on information provided by the insured to assess whether 
the business is a small business. The provision of false or misleading information is a 
serious matter. 
Note 2: 
For the meaning of small business, see section 35. 
 
(3) Subsection (2) does not apply to: 
 
(a) the making of an agreement to renew, extend or vary the contract; or

You have this duty until we agree to insure you.

or she should have, this may be treated as a failure by you to tell us something that you must 
tell us. 
If you do not tell us something 
In exercising the following rights, we may consider whether different types of cover can 
constitute separate contracts of life insurance. If they do, we may apply the following rights 
separately to each type of cover. 
If you do not tell us anything you are required to, and we would not have insured you if you 
had told us, we may avoid the contract within 3 years of entering into it. 
If we choose not to avoid the contract, we may, at any time, reduce the amount you have been 
insured for. This would be worked out using a formula that takes into account the premium 
that would have been payable if you had told us everything you should have. However, if the 
contract has a surrender value, or provides cover on death, we may only exercise this right 
within 3 years of entering into the contract. 
If we choose not to avoid the contract or reduce the amount you have been insured for, we 
may, at any time vary the contract in a way that places us in the same position we would have 
been in if you had told us everything you should have. However, this right does not apply if 
the contract has a surrender value or provides cover on death. 
If your failure to tell us is fraudulent, we may refuse to pay a claim and treat the contract as if 
it never existed.
