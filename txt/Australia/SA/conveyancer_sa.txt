In deciding whether to require the claimant to take action to recover the loss, and in 
deciding what action the claimant should be required to take to recover the loss, the

claimant's financial circumstances, the claimant's mental or physical health or capacity 
and any other factors that the Commissioner considers relevant.

the conveyancer by whom the fiduciary default was committed, or to whom 
the fiduciary default relates, was required to be registered or licensed under

(a) 
an admission or confession may be accepted as evidence of a fiduciary 
default despite the absence of the person by whom the admission or 
confession was made; and 
 
(b) 
questions of fact are to be decided on the balance of probabilities. 
39—Claimant's entitlement to compensation and interest 
 
(1) 
Subject to any reduction because of insufficiency of the indemnity fund, a claimant is 
entitled to payment of the amount of compensation determined under this Division. 
 
(2) 
A claimant's entitlement to compensation will (to the extent to which it has not been 
satisfied or discharged) be increased by interest at the rate fixed by regulation from the 
first anniversary of the lodgment of the claim with the Commissioner until the 
entitlement is satisfied or discharged, but interest must not be calculated on any 
component of the claimant's entitlement that is attributable to interest that has already

Published under the Legislation Revision and Publication Act 2002 
40—Rights of Commissioner 
 
(1) 
Where the Commissioner makes a payment (whether in respect of compensation or 
interest) to a claimant, the Commissioner is, to the extent of the payment, subrogated 
to the rights of the claimant against a person liable at law or in equity for the fiduciary 
default in respect of which the payment was made. 
 
(2) 
However, this section does not confer on the Commissioner any right to recover 
money from a person whose liability in respect of a fiduciary default does not arise 
from a wrongful or negligent act or omission on that person's part. 
41—Insurance in respect of claims against indemnity fund 
 
(1) 
The Commissioner may insure the indemnity fund to such extent as the Commissioner 
thinks fit against claims under this Division. 
 
(2) 
The cost of the insurance will be paid from the indemnity fund. 
42—Insufficiency of indemnity fund 
 
(1) 
Where the indemnity fund is insufficient to pay all outstanding amounts to which 
claimants are entitled, the Commissioner must make proportionate reductions in the 
amounts paid out in respect of those entitlements. 
 
(2) 
Where, at the time at which a claimant's entitlement to compensation is determined, 
other persons have made claims that have not yet been determined, the Commissioner 
may defer payment of the claimant's entitlement for any period (not exceeding 
12 months) in order to allow time for the entitlements of those other claimants to be 
determined. 
 
(3) 
The Commissioner may set aside a part of the indemnity fund as the Commissioner 
from time to time considers necessary to protect the interests of persons who— 
 
(a) 
have made claims against the fund that have not been determined; or 
 
(b) 
are likely to make claims against the fund in the future, 
and, when determining whether payments to claimants should be reduced, the 
Commissioner must not take into account a part of the fund set aside by the 
Commissioner. 
 
(4) 
If, after a claimant's entitlement to compensation has been determined, the claimant 
recovers an amount (that was not allowed for in that determination) in respect of the 
pecuniary loss suffered by the claimant, the claimant's entitlement to compensation is 
reduced by the amount recovered. 
 
(5) 
Entitlements in respect of which payments are made under this section are discharged 
despite the fact that they may not have been satisfied in full. 
 
(6) 
The Commissioner may, with the approval of the Minister, make payments to a 
person— 
 
(a) 
whose entitlement to compensation has been discharged; or 
 
(b) 
whose entitlement to compensation is insufficient because an amount that the 
person was expected to recover in respect of the pecuniary loss has not been 
recovered; or 
 
(c) 
whose claim is barred,
