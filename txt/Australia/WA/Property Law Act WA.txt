contained in the lease, shall be apportioned, and shall remain 
annexed to the severed parts of the reversionary estate as 
severed, and shall be in force with respect to the term whereon 
each several part is reversionary, or the term in the part of the 
land as to which the term has not been surrendered, or has not

that it extends to part only of the land demised, the lessee may 
within one month determine the lease in regard to the rest of the 
land by giving to the owner of the reversionary estate therein a 
counter notice expiring at the same time as the original notice.

under-lease derived out of the lease so surrendered. 
 
(2) 
A new lease may be granted and accepted, in place of a lease so 
surrendered, without a surrender of an under-lease as provided 
in subsection (1), and the new lease operates as if all 
under-leases derived out of the surrendered lease had been 
surrendered before the surrender of that lease was affected. 
 
(3) 
The lessee under the new lease and any person deriving title 
under him is entitled to the same rights and remedies in respect

(subject to the payment of any rent reserved by and to the 
observance of the covenants, agreements and conditions 
contained in the under-lease) as if the lease out of which the 
under-lease was derived had not been surrendered.

The lessor granting the new lease and any person deriving title 
under him is entitled to the same remedies by entry in and upon 
the land comprised in any such under-lease for rent reserved by 
or for breach of any covenant, agreement or conditions 
contained in the new lease (so far only as the rents reserved by 
or the covenants, agreements or conditions contained in the new 
lease do not exceed or impose greater burdens than those 
reserved by or contained in the original lease out of which the 
under-lease is derived) as he would have had —

Division 2 — Options in leases 
 
[Heading inserted: No. 35 of 1973 s. 3.] 
83A. 
Interpretation 
 
 
In this Division — 
 
(a) 
a reference to an option contained in a lease is a 
reference to a right on the part of the lessee to require 
the lessor — 
 
(i) 
to sell, or offer to sell, to the lessee the reversion 
expectant on the lease; or 
 
(ii) 
to grant, or offer to grant, to the lessee a renewal 
or extension of the lease, or a further lease, of the 
demised premises or a part thereof, 
 
 
whether the right is conferred by the lease or by an 
agreement collateral to the lease; and 
 
(b) 
a reference to a breach by a lessee of his obligations 
under a lease containing an option is a reference to a 
breach of those obligations by act or omission in so far 
as the act or omission would constitute a breach of those 
obligations if there were no option contained in the 
lease. 
 
[Section 83A inserted: No. 35 of 1973 s. 3.] 
83B. 
Construction and application of Division 
 
(1) 
In respect of leases of land under the Transfer of Land Act 1893, 
this Division shall be read and construed subject to section 68 of 
that Act. 
 
(2) 
This Division applies to and in respect of leases granted only 
after the coming into operation of the Property Law Act 
Amendment Act 1973 and options contained therein.

Breach of certain obligations not to preclude lessee from 
exercising option in certain circumstances 
 
(1) 
In this Division prescribed notice means a notice in writing 
that — 
 
(a) 
specifies an act or omission; and 
 
(b) 
states that, subject to any order of the Court under 
section 83D, a lessor giving the notice proposes to treat 
that act or omission as having precluded a lessee on 
whom the notice is served from exercising an option 
contained in the lease. 
 
(2) 
Where an act or omission that constituted a breach by a lessee of 
his obligations under a lease containing an option would, but for 
this section, have had the effect of precluding the lessee from 
exercising the option, the act or omission shall be deemed not to 
have had that effect where the lessee purports to exercise the 
option unless, during the period of 14 days next succeeding the 
purported exercise of the option, the lessor serves on the lessee 
prescribed notice of the act or omission and — 
 
(a) 
an order for relief against the effect of the breach in 
relation to the purported exercise of the option is not 
sought from the Court before the expiration of the period 
of one month next succeeding service of the notice; or 
 
(b) 
where such relief is so sought — 
 
(i) 
the proceedings in which the relief is sought are 
disposed of, in so far as they relate to that relief, 
otherwise than by granting relief; or 
 
(ii) 
where relief is granted upon terms to be complied 
with by the lessee before compliance by the 
lessor with the order granting relief, the lessee

Execution by attorney in his own name 
 
(1) 
The donee of a power of attorney may execute or do any 
assurance, instrument, or thing in and with his own name and 
signature and his own seal (where sealing is required) by the 
authority of the donor of the power. 
 
(2) 
Every assurance, instrument and thing so executed and done 
shall be as effectual in law to all intents as if it had been 
executed or done by the donee of the power in the name and 
with the signature and seal of the donor thereof. 
 
(3) 
This section applies to powers of attorney created by 
instruments executed either before or after the coming into 
operation of this Act. 
85. 
Continuance until notice of death or revocation received 
 
(1) 
Subject to any stipulation to the contrary contained in the 
instrument creating a power of attorney, the power, so far as 
concerns any act or thing done or suffered thereunder in good 
faith, operates and continues in force until notice of the death of 
the donor of the power or until notice of other revocation thereof 
has been received by the donee of the power. 
 
(2) 
Every act or thing within the scope of the power done or 
suffered in good faith by the donee of the power after the death 
of the donor of the power or other revocation referred to in 
subsection (1), and before notice thereof has been received by 
him, is effectual in all respects as if that death or other 
revocation had not happened or been made. 
 
(3) 
A statutory declaration by the donee of a power under the power 
of attorney to the effect that he has not received any notice or 
information of the revocation of the power of attorney by death 
or otherwise is, if made immediately before or if made after any 
such act as is mentioned in subsection (2), conclusive proof of 
the non-revocation at the time when the act was done or suffered

in favour of all persons dealing with the donee of the power in 
good faith and for valuable consideration without notice of the 
death of the donor of the power or other revocation of the power 
of attorney. 
 
(4) 
Where the donee of the power is a corporation aggregate the 
statutory declaration is sufficient if — 
 
(a) 
it is made by any director, manager, or secretary of the 
corporation or by any officer thereof discharging the 
functions usually appertaining to any of those offices or 
by any officer of the corporation appointed for that 
purpose either generally or in the particular instance by 
the board of directors, council or other governing body 
by resolution or otherwise; and 
 
(b) 
it is to the effect that to the best of the declarant’s 
knowledge and belief neither the donee of the power nor 
any servant or agent of the donee of the power has 
received any such notice or information as is mentioned 
in subsection (3). 
 
(5) 
Where the statutory declaration referred to in subsection (4) 
contains a statement that the declarant is a director, manager, or 
secretary of the corporation or is an officer of the corporation 
discharging the functions usually appertaining to any of those 
offices or is an officer of the corporation appointed for the 
purpose of making the declaration, that statement is conclusive

of the Corporations Act 2001 of the Commonwealth.

Part X — Powers of appointment 
93. 
Disclaimer etc. of powers 
 
 
A person to whom any power, whether coupled with an interest 
or not, is given may by deed disclaim, release or contract not to 
exercise the power, and after the disclaimer, release or contract 
is not capable of exercising or joining in the exercise of the 
power. 
94. 
Effect of disclaimer etc. 
 
 
On such disclaimer, release or contract as is referred to in 
section 93 being effected, the power may be exercised by the 
other person or persons or the survivor or survivors of the other 
persons to whom the power is given unless the contrary is 
expressed in the instrument creating the power. 
95. 
Protection of purchasers claiming under certain void 
appointments 
 
(1) 
An instrument purporting to exercise a power of appointment 
over property, that, in default of and subject to any appointment, 
is held in trust for a class or number of persons of whom the 
appointee is one, is not, except as provided in subsection (2), 
void on the ground of fraud on the power as against a purchaser 
in good faith. 
 
(2) 
If the interest appointed exceeds, in amount or value, the interest 
in that property to which immediately before the execution of 
the instrument the appointee was presumptively entitled under 
the trust in default of appointment, having regard to any 
advances made in his favour and to any hotchpot provision, the 
protection afforded by this section to a purchaser does not 
extend to such excess. 
 
(3) 
In this section a purchaser in good faith means a person 
dealing with an appointee of the age of not less than 25 years for 
valuable consideration in money or money’s worth, and without 
notice of the fraud, or of any circumstances from which, if

reasonable inquiries had been made, the fraud might have been 
discovered. 
 
(4) 
Persons deriving title under any purchaser entitled to the benefit 
of this section are entitled to the like benefit. 
 
(5) 
This section applies only to dealings effected after the coming 
into operation of this Act. 
96. 
Validation of appointments where objects are excluded or 
take illusory shares 
 
(1) 
An appointment made in exercise of a power to appoint any 
property among 2 or more objects is not invalid on the ground 
that — 
 
(a) 
an unsubstantial, illusory or nominal share only is 
appointed to or left unappointed to devolve upon any 
one or more of the objects of the power; or 
 
(b) 
any object of the power is thereby altogether 
excluded — 
 
 
but the appointment is valid notwithstanding that any one or 
more of the objects is not thereby, or in default of appointment, 
to take any share in the property. 
 
(2) 
This section does not affect any provision in the instrument 
creating the power that declares the amount of any share from 
which any object of the power is not to be excluded. 
 
(3) 
This section applies to any appointment made before or after the 
coming into operation of this Act. 
97. 
Execution of powers not testamentary 
 
(1) 
A deed executed in the manner in which a deed is required to be 
executed by this Act, so far as respects the execution and 
attestation thereof, is a valid execution of a power of 
appointment by deed or by any instrument in writing, not 
testamentary, notwithstanding that it is expressly required that a 
deed or instrument in writing, made in exercise of the power, is

to be executed or attested with some additional or other form of 
execution or attestation or solemnity. 
 
(2) 
This section does not operate to defeat any direction in the 
instrument creating the power that — 
 
(a) 
the consent of any particular person is to be necessary to 
a valid execution; 
 
(b) 
in order to give validity to any appointment, any act is to 
be performed having no relation to the mode of 
executing and attesting the instrument. 
 
(3) 
This section does not prevent the donee of a power from 
executing it in accordance with the power by writing, or 
otherwise than by an instrument executed and attested as a deed, 
and if a power is so executed this section does not apply. 
 
(4) 
This section shall apply to appointments by deed made after the 
coming into operation of this Act.

101. 
The perpetuity period 
 
 
In determining whether any limitation is invalid as infringing 
the rule against perpetuities, the perpetuity period is, for the 
purposes of that rule, such period of years not exceeding 80 as 
may be specified in the instrument creating that limitation or, if 
no such period of years is specified, the period that is applicable 
under the rule at law. 
102. 
Capacity to procreate or bear a child 
 
(1) 
This section applies whenever, in determining whether any 
limitation is invalid as infringing the rule against perpetuities, or 
in determining the right of any persons to put an end to a trust or 
accumulation, or generally in the management or administration 
of any trust, estate or fund, or for any purposes relating to the 
disposition, transmission or devolution of property, it becomes 
relevant to enquire whether any person is or at a relevant date 
was or will be capable of procreating or bearing a child or 
whether any person would on or after a relevant date adopt a 
child. 
 
(2) 
Where this section applies, there is a presumption, rebuttable by 
sufficient evidence to the contrary tendered at the time at which 
the matter falls for decision (but not subsequently), that — 
 
(a) 
a woman who has attained the age of 55 years is 
incapable of bearing a child; 
 
(aa) 
a woman will not, after she has attained the age of 
55 years, adopt a child; and 
 
(b) 
a male or female who has not attained the age of 
12 years is incapable of procreating or bearing a child. 
 
(3) 
Where this section applies, medical evidence that a male or 
female of any age is or at a relevant date was or will be 
incapable of procreating or bearing a child is admissible in 
proceedings in order to establish that incapacity, and the Court 
may accept any such evidence of a high degree of improbability 
of procreating or child-bearing as it thinks proper as establishing 
the incapacity.

(4) 
Any decision of the Court, in which any such presumption as is 
mentioned in subsection (2) is applied or in which any such 
evidence as is mentioned in subsection (3) is accepted remains 
effective notwithstanding the subsequent birth of a child or, in 
the case of the presumption mentioned in paragraph (aa) of that 
subsection (2), the subsequent adoption of a child; but if a 
limitation, that is not itself invalid as infringing the rule against 
perpetuities, confers upon that child or his spouse or de facto 
partner, or upon his issue or the spouse or de facto partner of 
any of his issue, a right to any property, that right (including any 
right to follow or trace the property) is not affected by the 
decision of the Court.

Wait and see rule 
 
(1) 
A limitation shall not be declared or treated as invalid, as 
infringing the rule against perpetuities, unless and until it is 
certain that the interest that it creates cannot vest within the 
perpetuity period or, if the limitation creates or confers a general 
power of appointment over or in connection with property, that 
the power cannot become exercisable within the perpetuity 
period, but if the power becomes exercisable, within that period, 
it is valid. 
 
(2) 
Where a limitation creates a power exercisable over or in 
connection with any property, whether that power be a special 
power of appointment, or a power of advancement or of 
distribution under a discretionary trust, or any other power (not 
being a general power of appointment or a power that is 
exempted from the application of the rule against perpetuities by 
section 29 of the Trustees Act 1962), that limitation is valid, so 
far as the rule against perpetuities is concerned — 
 
(a) 
if the power is exercisable only during the perpetuity 
period; or

(b) 
if and to the extent that the power is exercised during the 
perpetuity period. 
 
(3) 
Nothing in this section makes any person a life in being for the 
purpose of ascertaining the perpetuity period unless that person 
would have been reckoned a life in being for that purpose if this 
section had not been enacted. 
104. 
Power of Court to make declaration as to validity of 
limitations 
 
(1) 
A trustee of any property, or any person interested under, or on 
the invalidity of a limitation of property, may at any time apply 
to the Court for a declaration as to the validity, in respect of the 
rule against perpetuities, of a limitation of that property. 
 
(2) 
The Court may, on an application under subsection (1), make a 
declaration, on the basis of facts existing and events that have 
occurred at the time the declaration is made, as to the validity or 
otherwise of the limitation in respect of which the application is 
made; but the Court shall not make a declaration in respect of 
any limitation the validity of which cannot be determined at the 
time at which the Court is asked to make the declaration. 
105. 
Invalid age contingencies 
 
(1) 
Where in an instrument the absolute vesting either of capital or 
income of property, or the ascertainment of a beneficiary or 
class of beneficiaries, is made to depend on the attainment by 
any person of an age exceeding 21 years, and the gift to that 
beneficiary or class or any member thereof, or any gift over, 
remainder, executory limitation or trust arising on the total or 
partial failure of the original gift, would, but for this section, be 
rendered invalid as infringing the rule against perpetuities, the 
instrument takes effect for the purposes of that gift, gift over, 
remainder, executory limitation or trust as if the absolute vesting 
or ascertainment had been made to depend on the person 
attaining the age of 21 years, and that age shall be substituted 
for the age stated in the instrument.

This section applies to any instrument other than a will executed 
after 24 October 1942 and to any testamentary appointment 
(whether made in exercise of a general or special power), devise 
or bequest contained in the will of a person dying after that date, 
whether the will was made before or after that date; but, in the 
case of an instrument executed, and the will of a person dying, 
after 6 December 1962, this section applies only to the extent 
provided in section 107. 
 
(3) 
This section applies without prejudice to any provision whereby 
the absolute vesting either of capital or income of property, or 
the ascertainment of a beneficiary or class of beneficiaries, is 
also made to depend on the marriage of any person, or on any 
person entering into a de facto relationship, or any other event 
which may occur before the age stated in the instrument is 
attained.

Class gifts 
 
(1) 
A limitation to a class of persons is not invalid as infringing the 
rule against perpetuities by reason of the failure of the limitation 
as to some only of the members of the class, but the limitation 
shall, in that case, be construed and take effect as a limitation 
only to those members of the class who attain a vested interest 
within the perpetuity period. 
 
(2) 
This section applies only to the extent provided in section 107.

Order of applying rules 
 
(1) 
The provisions of section 105 shall not be applied — 
 
(a) 
unless and until it is certain that a limitation as worded is 
invalid as infringing the rule against perpetuities; and 
 
(b) 
unless either —

in conjunction with the provisions of section 106, 
would render the limitation valid. 
 
(2) 
The provisions of section 106 shall not be applied unless and 
until — 
 
(a) 
it is certain that a limitation as worded is invalid as 
infringing the rule against perpetuities; and 
 
(b) 
any invalid age contingency in that limitation has been 
reduced in accordance with the provisions of section 105 
as applied by subsection (1). 
108. 
Unborn spouses or de facto partners 
 
(1) 
The widow or widower of a person who is a life in being for the 
purpose of the rule against perpetuities shall be deemed a life in 
being for the purpose of — 
 
(a) 
a limitation in favour of that widow or widower; and 
 
(b) 
a limitation in favour of a person who attains, or of a 
class the members of which attain, according to the 
limitation, a vested interest on or after the death of the 
survivor of that person and his spouse. 
 
(2) 
The de facto partner of a person who is a life in being for the 
purpose of the rule against perpetuities shall be deemed a life in 
being for the purpose of — 
 
(a) 
a limitation in favour of that de facto partner; and 
 
(b) 
a limitation in favour of a person who attains, or of a 
class the members of which attain, according to the 
limitation, a vested interest on or after the death of the 
survivor of that person and the person’s de facto partner. 
 
[Section 108 amended: No. 28 of 2003 s. 163.]

Dependent limitations

perpetuities, is not invalidated solely by reason of its being

preceded by one or more invalid limitations, whether or not it 
expressly or by implication, takes effect after, or subject to, or is 
dependent upon, those invalid limitations or any of them. 
 
(2) 
Where a limitation is invalid as infringing the rule against 
perpetuities, any subsequent valid limitation is thereby 
accelerated. 
110. 
Options 
 
(1) 
The rule against perpetuities does not apply to — 
 
(a) 
an option granted to a lessee in respect of the property 
demised, being an option exercisable only during the 
currency of the lease or within one year after the 
expiration thereof and enabling the lessee or the lessee 
for the time being to purchase the freehold or other 
superior interest in the demised property; or 
 
(b) 
an option to acquire an interest in land, not being an 
option to which paragraph (a) refers. 
 
(2) 
An option to which subsection (1)(b) refers, and which 
according to its terms is, or may be, exercisable at a date more 
than 21 years from the date of its grant, becomes void, on the 
expiry of 21 years from the date of its grant, as between the 
original parties to that grant and all persons claiming through 
them. 
 
(3) 
Nothing in this section affects an option for renewal contained 
in a lease or a pre-emptive right to acquire an individual unit or 
individual units of accommodation in a building containing 
several units. 
111. 
Application of the rule to possibilities of reverter, rights of 
entry and resulting trusts 
 
(1) 
The rule against perpetuities as amended by this Part applies — 
 
(a) 
to a possibility of reverter in land consequent upon a fee 
simple determinable; and so that, if the fee simple does

not determine within the perpetuity period, it thereafter 
continues as a fee simple absolute; 
 
(b) 
to a right of entry for condition broken the exercise of 
which may determine a fee simple subject to a condition 
subsequent; and so that, if the right of entry is not 
exercised within the perpetuity period, the fee simple 
thereafter continues as a fee simple absolute; and 
 
(c) 
to an interest in property by way of resulting trust 
analogous to a possibility to a reverter in land; and so 
that, if the initial trust does not determine within the 
perpetuity period, the interest it creates thereafter 
continues as an absolute interest. 
 
(2) 
The provisions of subsection (1) apply as therein provided, 
whether the determinable or conditional estate or interest is 
charitable or not, except that the rule against perpetuities does 
not apply to a gift over from one charity to another. 
112. 
Powers of appointment 
 
 
For all purposes connected with the rule against perpetuities, a 
power of appointment under which there is a sole donee who is 
at all times free, without the concurrence of any other person, to 
appoint the whole of the property to himself is a general power, 
and every other power of appointment is a special power; but, 
notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, an 
appointment made by will under a power that would, but for the 
fact that it was made exercisable only by will, have been a 
general power is to be treated as having been made under a 
general power for all purposes connected with the rule against 
perpetuities. 
113. 
Accumulations of income 
 
(1) 
Where property is settled or disposed of in such manner that the 
income thereof may or shall be accumulated wholly or in part, 
the power or direction to accumulate that income is valid if the

disposition of the accumulated income is, or may be, valid and 
not otherwise. 
 
(2) 
Nothing in this section affects the right of any person or persons 
to terminate an accumulation that is for his or their benefit or 
any jurisdiction or power of the Court to maintain or advance 
out of accumulations or any powers of a trustee under Part V of 
the Trustees Act 1962. 
 
(3) 
For the avoidance of doubt, it is hereby declared that this section 
has effect only as provided by section 99.

Rule in Whitby v. Mitchell abolished 
 
 
The rule of law prohibiting the limitation after a life interest to 
an unborn person, of an interest in land to the unborn child or 
other issue of an unborn person is hereby abolished, but without 
prejudice to any other rule relating to perpetuities. 
115. 
Superannuation funds etc. 
 
(1) 
The rule against perpetuities does not apply and shall be deemed 
never to have applied to — 
 
(a) 
a trust or fund established for the purpose of making 
provision by way of assistance, benefits, superannuation, 
allowances, gratuities or pensions for the employees of 
any employer or the widows, widowers, de facto 
partners, children, grandchildren, parents or dependents 
of any of those employees or for any persons duly 
selected or nominated for that purpose pursuant to the 
provisions of the trust or fund; and 
 
(b) 
a trust or fund established for the purpose of making 
provision by way of superannuation for persons (not 
being employees) engaged in any lawful profession, 
trade, occupation or calling or the widows, widowers, 
de facto partners, children, grandchildren, parents or 
dependents of any of those persons or for any persons 
duly selected or nominated for that purpose pursuant to 
the provisions of the trust or fund.

executory, carries the intermediate income of that property from 
the death of the testator, except so far as the income or any part 
thereof may be otherwise expressly disposed of. 
 
(2) 
Where, under an instrument other than a will, property stands 
limited to a person for a contingent or future interest, or stands 
limited to trustees upon trust for a person whose interest is 
contingent or executory, that interest carries the intermediate 
income of that property from the time when the instrument 
comes into operation, except so far as the income or any part 
thereof may be otherwise expressly disposed of. 
 
(3) 
In determining whether any devise or bequest or other limitation 
of property carries the intermediate income of that property any 
uncertainty whether the devise or bequest or limitation will 
ultimately prove void for perpetuity shall be disregarded. 
 
(4) 
Subsection (1) applies only in relation to wills made after 
6 December 1962.

Application of section 120 
 
(1) 
Section 120 applies in respect of — 
 
(a) 
all property of any person that devolves according to the 
law of this State; 
 
(b) 
all appointments of trustees where the appointments 
have to be made according to the law of this State.

Devolution of property in cases of simultaneous deaths 
 
 
Where, after 6 December 1962, 2 or more persons have died at 
the same time or in circumstances that give rise to reasonable 
doubts as to which of them survived the other or others — 
 
(a) 
the property of each person so dying shall devolve and if 
he left a will it shall take effect, unless a contrary 
intention is shown by the will, as if he had survived the 
other person or persons so dying and had died 
immediately afterwards; 
 
(b) 
every donatio mortis causa made by a person so dying 
to another person so dying is void and of no effect; 
 
(c) 
if the life of a person so dying is insured under any 
policy of life or accident insurance, and any other person 
or persons so dying would be entitled (otherwise than 
under a will or on the intestacy of any person) to the 
proceeds payable under the policy or any part of the 
proceeds if he or they survived the person so insured, the 
proceeds shall, unless a contrary intention is shown by 
the instrument governing the distribution of the 
proceeds, be distributed as if the person so insured had 
survived every other person so dying and had died 
immediately afterwards; 
 
(d) 
any property owned jointly and exclusively by 2 or more 
of the persons so dying, other than property so owned by 
them as trustees, shall devolve as if it were owned by 
them when they died as tenants in common in equal 
shares; 
 
(e) 
where, under any will or trust or other disposition, any 
property would have passed, whether in consequence of 
section 33 of the Wills Act 1837 of the United Kingdom 
Parliament or otherwise to any of 2 or more possible 
beneficiaries (being persons who have so died) if any of 
them could be shown to have survived the other or 
others of them, then, unless a contrary intention is 
shown by the will, trust or disposition, it takes effect as

if the property were given to those possible beneficiaries 
as tenants in common in equal shares, and the property 
devolves accordingly, but this paragraph does not apply 
in any case to which paragraph (c) or paragraph (f) 
applies; 
 
(f) 
where a power of appointment could have been 
exercised in respect of any property by any of 2 or more 
persons so dying if any of them could be shown to have 
survived the other or others of them, unless a contrary 
intention is shown by the instrument creating the power, 
the power may be exercised as if an equal share of that 
property had been set apart for appointment by each of 
those persons, and as if each of those persons had the 
power of appointment in respect of the share of the 
property so set apart for appointment by him, and that 
share shall devolve in default of appointment by him in 
the manner in which the property would have devolved 
in default of appointment by him if he had been the 
survivor of those persons, but this paragraph does not 
apply in any case to which paragraph (c) applies; 
 
(g) 
where, by any will or other testamentary disposition, any 
property is devised or bequeathed or appointed to the 
survivor of 2 or more of the testator’s children or other 
issue within the meaning of section 117 4 and all or the 
last survivors of those children or issue are persons so 
dying that section (where it applies) takes effect as if the 
devise or bequest or appointment were in equal shares to 
those of them who so die and leave a child or children 
living at the death of the testator;

where the persons so dying include a testator and one or 
more of his issue, however remote, then for the purpose 
of section 33 of the Wills Act 1837 of the United 
Kingdom Parliament where that section applies, the 
testator shall be deemed to have survived all his issue so 
dying and to have died immediately afterwards, and 
accordingly, unless a contrary intention is shown by the

any court, whether in an action or other proceeding or by way of 
defence, set off, counterclaim or otherwise, and that relief could

Nothing in this section enables relief to be given in respect of 
any payment made at a time when the law requires or allows, or

changed or shown not to have been as it was commonly

Relief, whether under section 124 or in equity or otherwise, in 
respect of any payment made under mistake, whether of law or 
fact, shall be denied wholly or in part if the person from whom 
relief is sought received the payment in good faith and has so 
altered his position in reliance on the validity of the payment 
that in the opinion of the Court, having regard to all possible 
implications in respect of the parties (other than the plaintiff or 
claimant) to the payment and of other persons acquiring rights 
or interests through them, it is inequitable to grant relief, or to 
grant relief in full.

Where the Court makes an order for the repayment of any 
money paid under a mistake, the Court may in that order direct 
that the repayment shall be by periodic payments or by

shown, as the Court thinks fit.

Part XIV — Partition of land and division of chattels 
126. 
In action for partition Court may direct land to be sold 
 
(1) 
Where in an action for partition the party or parties interested, 
individually or collectively, to the extent of a half share or 
upwards in the land to which the action relates request the Court 
to direct a sale of the land and a distribution of the proceeds, 
instead of a division of the land between or among the parties 
interested, the Court shall, unless it sees good reason to the 
contrary, direct a sale accordingly. 
 
(2) 
The Court may, if it thinks fit, on the request of any party 
interested, and notwithstanding the dissent or disability of any 
other party, direct a sale in any case where it appears to the 
Court that, by reason of the nature of the land, or of the number 
of the parties interested or presumptively interested therein, or 
of the absence or disability of any of those parties, or of any 
other circumstance, a sale of the land would be for the benefit of 
the parties interested. 
 
(3) 
The Court may also, if it thinks fit, on the request of any party 
interested, direct that the land be sold, unless the other parties 
interested, or some of them, undertake to purchase the share of 
the party requesting a sale; and, on such an undertaking being 
given, may direct a valuation of the share of the party requesting 
a sale. 
 
(4) 
On directing a sale or valuation to be made under subsection (3) 
the Court may give also all necessary or proper consequential 
directions. 
 
(5) 
Any person may maintain such an action as is referred to in 
subsection (1) against any one or more of the parties interested 
without serving the other or others, and — 
 
(a) 
it is not competent to any defendant in the action to 
object for want of parties; and 
 
(b) 
at the hearing of the cause the Court may direct such 
inquiries as to the nature of the land and the persons

necessary or proper, with a view to an order for partition 
or sale being made on further consideration, 
 
 
but all persons who, if this Act had not come into operation 
would have been necessary parties to the action — 
 
(c) 
shall be served with notice of the decree or order on the 
hearing; 
 
(d) 
are bound, after the notice is so served, by the 
proceedings, as if they had originally been parties to the 
action and shall be deemed parties to the action; and 
 
(e) 
have liberty to attend the proceedings and any of those 
persons may within a time limited by rules of Court 
apply to the Court to add to the decree or order. 
 
(6) 
On any sale under this section the Court may allow any of the 
parties interested in the land to bid at the sale, on such terms as 
the Court deems reasonable as to non-payment of deposit, or as 
to setting off or accounting for the purchase money or any part 
thereof instead of paying the same, or as to any other matters. 
127. 
Proceeds of sale, how applied 
 
(1) 
All money received under any sale under section 126 may, if the 
Court thinks fit, be paid to trustees appointed by the Court, and 
applied, as the Court from time to time directs — 
 
(a) 
in the discharge of any encumbrance affecting the land 
directed to be sold; and 
 
(b) 
subject to that encumbrance, in the payment of the 
residue to the parties interested. 
 
(2) 
Where the Court so directs, the trustees (if any) may apply the 
money in manner referred to in subsection (1), but if the Court 
does not so direct, any party interested may apply to the Court 
for an order that the money be so applied.

Where any chattels belong to persons jointly or in undivided 
shares, the persons interested to the extent of a half share or 
upwards may apply to the Court for an order for division of the 
chattels or of any of them, according to a valuation or otherwise 
or for sale and division of the proceeds and the Court may make

Terms used in this Part 
 
(1) 
In this Part, unless the contrary intention appears — 
 
annuities includes salaries and pensions; 
 
dividends includes (besides dividends strictly so called) all 
payments made by the name of dividend, bonus, or otherwise 
out of the revenue of trading or other companies or corporations, 
divisible between all or any of the members thereof, whether 
those payments are usually made or declared at any fixed times 
or otherwise; but “dividends” does not include payments in the 
nature of a return or reimbursement of capital; 
 
rent includes rents and all periodical payments or renderings in 
lieu of or in the nature of rent. 
 
(2) 
All such divisible revenue as is referred to in the interpretation 
“dividends” shall for the purposes of this section be deemed to 
have accrued by equal daily increments during and within the 
period for or in respect of which the payment of the same 
revenue is declared or expressed to be made.

Income apportionable in respect of time 
 
 
All rents, annuities, dividends, and other periodical payments in 
the nature of income (whether reserved or made payable under 
an instrument in writing or otherwise) shall, like interest on 
money lent, be considered as accruing from day to day, and 
shall be apportionable in respect of time accordingly. 
132. 
Time when apportioned part payable 
 
 
The apportioned part of any such rent, annuity, dividend, or 
other payment as is referred to in section 131 is payable or 
recoverable in the case of a continuing rent, annuity, or other 
payment as soon as the entire portion of which the apportioned 
part forms part becomes due and payable, and not before; and 
where the payment is determined by re-entry, death, or

dividend or other payment would have become payable if it had 
not so determined, and not before. 
133. 
Recovery of apportioned parts 
 
(1) 
Subject to subsection (2) all persons and their respective 
personal representatives and assigns, and also the personal 
representatives and assigns respectively of persons whose 
interests determined with their own death, have such or the 
same remedies, legal and equitable, for recovering such 
apportioned parts as are referred to in section 132 when payable 
(allowing for a proportionate part of all just allowance) as they 
respectively would have had for recovering such entire portions 
as are so referred to if entitled thereto respectively. 
 
(2) 
Where a person is liable to pay rent reserved out of or charged 
on lands or other hereditaments of any tenure, that person and 
the lands or other hereditaments shall not be resorted to for any 
apportioned part forming part of an entire or continuing rent as 
provided in section 132; but the entire or continuing rent, 
including the apportioned part, shall be recovered and received 
by the person who, if the rent had not been apportionable under 
this Part or otherwise, would have been entitled to the entire or 
continuing rent; and the apportioned part is recoverable from the 
last mentioned person by the personal representatives, or other 
parties entitled thereto under this Part.
