Land Boundaries Act 1841  
An Act to provide for the more effectual and accurate establishment 
of the boundaries of land within the Colony of Western Australia.  
Preamble 
Whereas the want of a sufficient survey-force in this Colony has 
heretofore rendered it impossible to ascertain with accuracy the proper 
boundaries of several grants of land; and whereas many deeds have 
accordingly been issued, in which the land has been described, either by 
marks or measurements which on more accurate survey are likely to 
prove in some degree erroneous, or by measurements to be made of 
certain distances in certain directions, according to the compass; and 
whereas it is expedient that all such descriptions should, with as little 
delay as possible, be corrected or carried into effect, by the erection of 
visible landmarks upon the several lands under the direction of the 
Surveyor-General of this Colony: 
1. 
Marking of boundaries  
 
 
Be it therefore enacted by His Excellency the Governor of 
Western Australia, by and with the advice and consent of the 
Legislative Council thereof, that it shall be lawful for the 
Government, as soon as conveniently may be after the passing 
of this Act, to direct an authorised land officer to ascertain and 
mark by landmarks the proper boundaries of every grant 
heretofore made or hereafter to be made by Her Majesty, or her 
predecessors, her heirs or successors, of lands within this 
Colony, of which the description contained in the deed of grant 
shall be such as hereinbefore stated. 
 
[Section 1 amended: No. 126 of 1987 s. 4.]

2. 
Notice of intended survey to be Gazetted 
 
 
And be it enacted that notice shall be published in 3 successive 
‘Gazettes’ of the intended survey of each district. 
3. 
Approval, recording and Gazettal of marked boundaries  
 
 
And be it enacted that whensoever and so soon as the several 
boundaries shall have been ascertained and marked within any 
such district as aforesaid, an authorised land officer shall report 
the same, accompanied by a map or plan of the said district, and 
a description of the several landmarks placed therein, for the 
approval of the Governor-in-Council; and when so approved 
shall enter a description of each grant of land so surveyed, 
according to such landmarks, in a record-book to be kept by him 
for that purpose; and every such description shall be signed by 
him and by the Governor-in-Council; and notice of every such 
entry shall be published in 3 successive ‘Gazettes’. 
 
[Section 3 amended: No. 126 of 1987 s. 5.]  
4. 
Recorded boundaries deemed true boundaries, etc.  
 
 
And be it enacted that all boundaries of lands so entered and 
signed as aforesaid, shall be deemed and taken to be the true 
boundaries of such lands respectively; all former descriptions 
thereof, in any title deeds or otherwise, notwithstanding, and 
whether such lands be in possession of the original owner or 
owners, or of his, her or their heir or assignee; and such 
record-book or a certified copy to be made and issued on 
demand without fee, of any entry in such book signed by the 
Surveyor-General or, in the case of signature of any such 
entry after the coming into operation of section 6 of the 
Acts Amendment (Land Administration) Act 1987, by an 
authorised land officer shall and may be given in evidence of the 
boundaries of such lands in any suit or cause affecting the same.

known as the ‘Avon Base Line’, shall be deemed and taken in

and contain in the survey formerly made of the said ‘Avon Base 
Line’.
