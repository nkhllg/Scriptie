Basis for Conclusions on IAS 40 
 
 
Australian Accounting Standard AASB 140 Investment Property (as amended) is set out in paragraphs 1 – Aus86.2 
and Appendix A.  All the paragraphs have equal authority.  Paragraphs in bold type state the main principles.  
AASB 140 is to be read in the context of other Australian Accounting Standards, including AASB 1048 Interpretation 
of Standards, which identifies the Australian Accounting Interpretations, and AASB 1057 Application of Australian 
Accounting Standards.  In the absence of explicit guidance, AASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting 
Estimates and Errors provides a basis for selecting and applying accounting policies.

COMPARISON 
Comparison with IAS 40 
AASB 140 Investment Property as amended incorporates IAS 40 Investment Property as issued and amended by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB).  Australian-specific paragraphs (which are not included in IAS 40) 
are identified with the prefix “Aus”.  Paragraphs that apply only to not-for-profit entities begin by identifying their 
limited applicability. 
Tier 1 
For-profit entities complying with AASB 140 also comply with IAS 40. 
Not-for-profit entities’ compliance with IAS 40 will depend on whether any “Aus” paragraphs that specifically apply 
to not-for-profit entities provide additional guidance or contain applicable requirements that are inconsistent with 
IAS 40. 
Tier 2 
Entities preparing general purpose financial statements under Australian Accounting Standards – Simplified 
Disclosures (Tier 2) will not be in compliance with IFRS Standards. 
AASB 1053 Application of Tiers of Australian Accounting Standards explains the two tiers of reporting requirements.

STANDARD 
Accounting Standard AASB 140 
The Australian Accounting Standards Board made Accounting Standard AASB 140 Investment Property under 
section 334 of the Corporations Act 2001 on 14 August 2015. 
This compiled version of AASB 140 applies to annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2023. It incorporates 
relevant amendments contained in other AASB Standards made by the AASB up to and including 15 December 2022 
(see Compilation Details). 
Accounting Standard AASB 140 
Investment Property 
Objective 
1 
The objective of this Standard is to prescribe the accounting treatment for investment property and related 
disclosure requirements. 
AusCF1 
AusCF entities are: 
(a) 
not-for-profit entities; and 
(b) 
for-profit entities that are not applying the Conceptual Framework for Financial 
Reporting (as identified in AASB 1048 Interpretation of Standards). 
For AusCF entities, the term ‘reporting entity’ is defined in AASB 1057 Application of 
Australian Accounting Standards and Statement of Accounting Concepts SAC 1 Definition of the 
Reporting Entity also applies. For-profit entities applying the Conceptual Framework for 
Financial Reporting are set out in paragraph Aus1.1 of the Conceptual Framework. 
Scope 
2 
This Standard shall be applied in the recognition, measurement and disclosure of investment 
property.

[Deleted] 
4 
This Standard does not apply to: 
(a) 
biological assets related to agricultural activity (see AASB 141 Agriculture and AASB 116 
Property, Plant and Equipment); and 
(b) 
mineral rights and mineral reserves such as oil, natural gas and similar non-regenerative 
resources. 
Definitions 
5 
The following terms are used in this Standard with the meanings specified:  
Carrying amount is the amount at which an asset is recognised in the statement of financial position.  
Cost is the amount of cash or cash equivalents paid or the fair value of other consideration given to 
acquire an asset at the time of its acquisition or construction or, where applicable, the amount 
attributed to that asset when initially recognised in accordance with the specific requirements of 
other Standards, eg AASB 2 Share-based Payment. 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an 
orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. (See AASB 13 Fair Value 
Measurement). 
Investment property is property (land or a building—or part of a building—or both) held (by the 
owner or by the lessee as a right-of-use asset) to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both, 
rather than for: 
(a) 
use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes; or

STANDARD 
(b) 
sale in the ordinary course of business.  
Owner-occupied property is property held (by the owner or by the lessee as a right-of-use asset) for use 
in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. 
Classification of property as investment property or owner-occupied 
property 
6 
[Deleted] 
7 
Investment property is held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation or both. Therefore, an investment 
property generates cash flows largely independently of the other assets held by an entity. This distinguishes 
investment property from owner-occupied property. The production or supply of goods or services (or the 
use of property for administrative purposes) generates cash flows that are attributable not only to property, 
but also to other assets used in the production or supply process. AASB 116 applies to owned owner-
occupied property and AASB 16 Leases applies to owner-occupied property held by a lessee as a right-of-
use asset.  
8 
The following are examples of investment property:  
(a) 
land held for long-term capital appreciation rather than for short-term sale in the ordinary course 
of business. 
(b) 
land held for a currently undetermined future use. (If an entity has not determined that it will use 
the land as owner-occupied property or for short-term sale in the ordinary course of business, the 
land is regarded as held for capital appreciation.) 
(c) 
a building owned by the entity (or a right-of-use asset relating to a building held by the entity) 
and leased out under one or more operating leases. 
(d) 
a building that is vacant but is held to be leased out under one or more operating leases. 
(e) 
property that is being constructed or developed for future use as investment property. 
9 
The following are examples of items that are not investment property and are therefore outside the scope of 
this Standard:  
(a) 
property intended for sale in the ordinary course of business or in the process of construction or 
development for such sale (see AASB 102 Inventories), for example, property acquired 
exclusively with a view to subsequent disposal in the near future or for development and resale. 
(b) 
[deleted] 
(c) 
owner-occupied property (see AASB 116 and AASB 16), including (among other things) 
property held for future use as owner-occupied property, property held for future development 
and subsequent use as owner-occupied property, property occupied by employees (whether or not 
the employees pay rent at market rates) and owner-occupied property awaiting disposal. 
(d) 
[deleted] 
(e) 
property that is leased to another entity under a finance lease. 
Aus9.1 
In respect of not-for-profit entities, property may be held to meet service delivery objectives 
rather than to earn rental or for capital appreciation. In such situations the property will not meet 
the definition of investment property and will be accounted for under AASB 116, for example: 
(a) 
property held for strategic purposes; and 
(b) 
property held to provide a social service, including those which generate cash inflows 
where the rental revenue is incidental to the purpose for holding the property. 
10 
Some properties comprise a portion that is held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation and another 
portion that is held for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes. If 
these portions could be sold separately (or leased out separately under a finance lease), an entity accounts 
for the portions separately. If the portions could not be sold separately, the property is investment property 
only if an insignificant portion is held for use in the production or supply of goods or services or for 
administrative purposes. 
11 
In some cases, an entity provides ancillary services to the occupants of a property it holds. An entity treats 
such a property as investment property if the services are insignificant to the arrangement as a whole. An 
example is when the owner of an office building provides security and maintenance services to the lessees 
who occupy the building. 
Authorised Version F2023C00417 registered 08/05/2023

AASB 140-compiled

STANDARD 
12 
In other cases, the services provided are significant. For example, if an entity owns and manages a hotel, 
services provided to guests are significant to the arrangement as a whole. Therefore, an owner-managed 
hotel is owner-occupied property, rather than investment property. 
13 
It may be difficult to determine whether ancillary services are so significant that a property does not qualify 
as investment property. For example, the owner of a hotel sometimes transfers some responsibilities to third 
parties under a management contract. The terms of such contracts vary widely. At one end of the spectrum, 
the owner’s position may, in substance, be that of a passive investor. At the other end of the spectrum, the 
owner may simply have outsourced day-to-day functions while retaining significant exposure to variation in 
the cash flows generated by the operations of the hotel. 
14 
Judgement is needed to determine whether a property qualifies as investment property. An entity develops 
criteria so that it can exercise that judgement consistently in accordance with the definition of investment 
property and with the related guidance in paragraphs 7–13. Paragraph 75(c) requires an entity to disclose 
these criteria when classification is difficult.  
14A 
Judgement is also needed to determine whether the acquisition of investment property is the acquisition of 
an asset or a group of assets or a business combination within the scope of AASB 3 Business Combinations. 
Reference should be made to AASB 3 to determine whether it is a business combination. The discussion in 
paragraphs 7–14 of this Standard relates to whether or not property is owner-occupied property or 
investment property and not to determining whether or not the acquisition of property is a business 
combination as defined in AASB 3. Determining whether a specific transaction meets the definition of a 
business combination as defined in AASB 3 and includes an investment property as defined in this Standard 
requires the separate application of both Standards. 
15 
In some cases, an entity owns property that is leased to, and occupied by, its parent or another subsidiary. 
The property does not qualify as investment property in the consolidated financial statements, because the 
property is owner-occupied from the perspective of the group. However, from the perspective of the entity 
that owns it, the property is investment property if it meets the definition in paragraph 5. Therefore, the 
lessor treats the property as investment property in its individual financial statements.  
Recognition 
16 
An owned investment property shall be recognised as an asset when, and only when: 
(a) 
it is probable that the future economic benefits that are associated with the investment 
property will flow to the entity; and 
(b) 
the cost of the investment property can be measured reliably. 
17 
An entity evaluates under this recognition principle all its investment property costs at the time they are 
incurred. These costs include costs incurred initially to acquire an investment property and costs incurred 
subsequently to add to, replace part of, or service a property. 
18 
Under the recognition principle in paragraph 16, an entity does not recognise in the carrying amount of an 
investment property the costs of the day-to-day servicing of such a property. Rather, these costs are 
recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Costs of day-to-day servicing are primarily the cost of labour and 
consumables, and may include the cost of minor parts. The purpose of these expenditures is often described 
as for the ‘repairs and maintenance’ of the property.  
19 
Parts of investment properties may have been acquired through replacement. For example, the interior walls 
may be replacements of original walls. Under the recognition principle, an entity recognises in the carrying 
amount of an investment property the cost of replacing part of an existing investment property at the time 
that cost is incurred if the recognition criteria are met. The carrying amount of those parts that are replaced 
is derecognised in accordance with the derecognition provisions of this Standard. 
19A 
An investment property held by a lessee as a right-of-use asset shall be recognised in accordance with 
AASB 16. 
Measurement at recognition 
20 
An owned investment property shall be measured initially at its cost. Transaction costs shall be 
included in the initial measurement. 
Aus20.1 
Notwithstanding paragraph 20, not-for-profit entities shall initially measure the cost of the 
asset at fair value in accordance with AASB 13 Fair Value Measurement where the 
consideration for the asset is significantly less than fair value principally to enable the entity

to further its objectives. AASB 1058 Income of Not-for-Profit Entities addresses the 
recognition of related amounts. 
21 
The cost of a purchased investment property comprises its purchase price and any directly attributable 
expenditure. Directly attributable expenditure includes, for example, professional fees for legal services, 
property transfer taxes and other transaction costs. 
22 
[Deleted] 
23 
The cost of an investment property is not increased by:  
(a) 
start-up costs (unless they are necessary to bring the property to the condition necessary for it to 
be capable of operating in the manner intended by management), 
(b) 
operating losses incurred before the investment property achieves the planned level of occupancy, 
or 
(c) 
abnormal amounts of wasted material, labour or other resources incurred in constructing or 
developing the property. 
24 
If payment for an investment property is deferred, its cost is the cash price equivalent. The difference 
between this amount and the total payments is recognised as interest expense over the period of credit. 
25 
[Deleted] 
26

27 
One or more investment properties may be acquired in exchange for a non-monetary asset or assets, or a 
combination of monetary and non-monetary assets. The following discussion refers to an exchange of one 
non-monetary asset for another, but it also applies to all exchanges described in the preceding sentence. The 
cost of such an investment property is measured at fair value unless (a) the exchange transaction lacks 
commercial substance or (b) the fair value of neither the asset received nor the asset given up is reliably 
measurable. The acquired asset is measured in this way even if an entity cannot immediately derecognise 
the asset given up. If the acquired asset is not measured at fair value, its cost is measured at the carrying 
amount of the asset given up.  
28 
An entity determines whether an exchange transaction has commercial substance by considering the extent 
to which its future cash flows are expected to change as a result of the transaction. An exchange transaction 
has commercial substance if:  
(a) 
the configuration (risk, timing and amount) of the cash flows of the asset received differs from 
the configuration of the cash flows of the asset transferred, or 
(b) 
the entity-specific value of the portion of the entity’s operations affected by the transaction 
changes as a result of the exchange, and 
(c) 
the difference in (a) or (b) is significant relative to the fair value of the assets exchanged. 
For the purpose of determining whether an exchange transaction has commercial substance, the entity-
specific value of the portion of the entity’s operations affected by the transaction shall reflect post-tax cash 
flows. The result of these analyses may be clear without an entity having to perform detailed calculations. 
29 
The fair value of an asset is reliably measurable if (a) the variability in the range of reasonable fair value 
measurements is not significant for that asset or (b) the probabilities of the various estimates within the 
range can be reasonably assessed and used when measuring fair value. If the entity is able to measure 
reliably the fair value of either the asset received or the asset given up, then the fair value of the asset given 
up is used to measure cost unless the fair value of the asset received is more clearly evident. 
29A 
An investment property held by a lessee as a right-of-use asset shall be measured initially at its cost in 
accordance with AASB 16. 
Measurement after recognition 
Accounting policy 
30 
With the exception noted in paragraph 32A, an entity shall choose as its accounting policy either the 
fair value model in paragraphs 33–55 or the cost model in paragraph 56 and shall apply that policy to 
all of its investment property.  
31 
AASB 108 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors states that a voluntary 
change in accounting policy shall be made only if the change results in the financial statements providing 
reliable and more relevant information about the effects of transactions, other events or conditions on the

STANDARD 
entity’s financial position, financial performance or cash flows. It is highly unlikely that a change from the 
fair value model to the cost model will result in a more relevant presentation.  
32 
This Standard requires all entities to measure the fair value of investment property, for the purpose of either 
measurement (if the entity uses the fair value model) or disclosure (if it uses the cost model). An entity is 
encouraged, but not required, to measure the fair value of investment property on the basis of a valuation by 
an independent valuer who holds a recognised and relevant professional qualification and has recent 
experience in the location and category of the investment property being valued.  
32A 
An entity may:  
(a) 
choose either the fair value model or the cost model for all investment property backing 
liabilities that pay a return linked directly to the fair value of, or returns from, specified 
assets including that investment property; and 
(b) 
choose either the fair value model or the cost model for all other investment property, 
regardless of the choice made in (a). 
32B 
Some entities operate, either internally or externally, an investment fund that provides investors with 
benefits determined by units in the fund. Similarly, some entities issue insurance contracts with direct 
participation features, for which the underlying items include investment property. For the purposes of 
paragraphs 32A–32B only, insurance contracts include investment contracts with discretionary participation 
features. Paragraph 32A does not permit an entity to measure property held by the fund (or property that is 
an underlying item) partly at cost and partly at fair value. (See AASB 17 Insurance Contracts for terms 
used in this paragraph that are defined in that Standard.) 
32C 
If an entity chooses different models for the two categories described in paragraph 32A, sales of investment 
property between pools of assets measured using different models shall be recognised at fair value and the 
cumulative change in fair value shall be recognised in profit or loss. Accordingly, if an investment property 
is sold from a pool in which the fair value model is used into a pool in which the cost model is used, the 
property’s fair value at the date of the sale becomes its deemed cost.  
Fair value model 
33 
After initial recognition, an entity that chooses the fair value model shall measure all of its investment 
property at fair value, except in the cases described in paragraph 53.  
34 
[Deleted] 
35 
A gain or loss arising from a change in the fair value of investment property shall be recognised in 
profit or loss for the period in which it arises.  
36– 
39 
[Deleted] 
40 
When measuring the fair value of investment property in accordance with AASB 13, an entity shall ensure 
that the fair value reflects, among other things, rental income from current leases and other assumptions that 
market participants would use when pricing investment property under current market conditions.  
40A 
When a lessee uses the fair value model to measure an investment property that is held as a right-of-use 
asset, it shall measure the right-of-use asset, and not the underlying property, at fair value. 
41 
AASB 16 specifies the basis for initial recognition of the cost of an investment property held by a lessee as 
a right-of-use asset. Paragraph 33 requires the investment property held by a lessee as a right-of-use asset to 
be remeasured, if necessary, to fair value if the entity chooses the fair value model. When lease payments 
are at market rates, the fair value of an investment property held by a lessee as a right-of-use asset at 
acquisition, net of all expected lease payments (including those relating to recognised lease liabilities), 
should be zero. Thus, remeasuring a right-of-use asset from cost in accordance with AASB 16 to fair value 
in accordance with paragraph 33 (taking into account the requirements in paragraph 50) should not give rise 
to any initial gain or loss, unless fair value is measured at different times. This could occur when an election 
to apply the fair value model is made after initial recognition.  
42– 
47 
[Deleted] 
48 
In exceptional cases, there is clear evidence when an entity first acquires an investment property (or when 
an existing property first becomes investment property after a change in use) that the variability in the range 
of reasonable fair value measurements will be so great, and the probabilities of the various outcomes so 
difficult to assess, that the usefulness of a single measure of fair value is negated. This may indicate that the 
fair value of the property will not be reliably measurable on a continuing basis (see paragraph 53).

In determining the carrying amount of investment property under the fair value model, an entity does not 
double-count assets or liabilities that are recognised as separate assets or liabilities. For example:  
(a) 
equipment such as lifts or air-conditioning is often an integral part of a building and is generally 
included in the fair value of the investment property, rather than recognised separately as 
property, plant and equipment. 
(b) 
if an office is leased on a furnished basis, the fair value of the office generally includes the fair 
value of the furniture, because the rental income relates to the furnished office. When furniture is 
included in the fair value of investment property, an entity does not recognise that furniture as a 
separate asset. 
(c) 
the fair value of investment property excludes prepaid or accrued operating lease income, because 
the entity recognises it as a separate liability or asset. 
(d) 
the fair value of investment property held by a lessee as a right-of-use asset reflects expected cash 
flows (including variable lease payments that are expected to become payable). Accordingly, if a 
valuation obtained for a property is net of all payments expected to be made, it will be necessary 
to add back any recognised lease liability, to arrive at the carrying amount of the investment 
property using the fair value model. 
51 
[Deleted] 
52 
In some cases, an entity expects that the present value of its payments relating to an investment property 
(other than payments relating to recognised liabilities) will exceed the present value of the related cash 
receipts. An entity applies AASB 137 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets to determine 
whether to recognise a liability and, if so, how to measure it.  
Inability to measure fair value reliably 
53 
There is a rebuttable presumption that an entity can reliably measure the fair value of an investment 
property on a continuing basis. However, in exceptional cases, there is clear evidence when an entity 
first acquires an investment property (or when an existing property first becomes investment 
property after a change in use) that the fair value of the investment property is not reliably 
measurable on a continuing basis. This arises when, and only when, the market for comparable 
properties is inactive (eg there are few recent transactions, price quotations are not current or 
observed transaction prices indicate that the seller was forced to sell) and alternative reliable 
measurements of fair value (for example, based on discounted cash flow projections) are not 
available. If an entity determines that the fair value of an investment property under construction is 
not reliably measurable but expects the fair value of the property to be reliably measurable when 
construction is complete, it shall measure that investment property under construction at cost until 
either its fair value becomes reliably measurable or construction is completed (whichever is earlier). 
If an entity determines that the fair value of an investment property (other than an investment 
property under construction) is not reliably measurable on a continuing basis, the entity shall 
measure that investment property using the cost model in AASB 116 for owned investment property 
or in accordance with AASB 16 for investment property held by a lessee as a right-of-use asset. The 
residual value of the investment property shall be assumed to be zero. The entity shall continue to 
apply AASB 116 or AASB 16 until disposal of the investment property. 
53A 
Once an entity becomes able to measure reliably the fair value of an investment property under construction 
that has previously been measured at cost, it shall measure that property at its fair value. Once construction 
of that property is complete, it is presumed that fair value can be measured reliably. If this is not the case, in 
accordance with paragraph 53, the property shall be accounted for using the cost model in accordance with 
AASB 116 for owned assets or AASB 16 for investment property held by a lessee as a right-of-use asset. 
53B 
The presumption that the fair value of investment property under construction can be measured reliably can 
be rebutted only on initial recognition. An entity that has measured an item of investment property under 
construction at fair value may not conclude that the fair value of the completed investment property cannot 
be measured reliably. 
54 
In the exceptional cases when an entity is compelled, for the reason given in paragraph 53, to measure an 
investment property using the cost model in accordance with AASB 116 or AASB 16, it measures at fair 
value all its other investment property, including investment property under construction. In these cases, 
although an entity may use the cost model for one investment property, the entity shall continue to account 
for each of the remaining properties using the fair value model.

business) even if comparable market transactions become less frequent or market prices become less 
readily available. 
Cost model 
56  
After initial recognition, an entity that chooses the cost model shall measure investment property: 
(a) 
in accordance with AASB 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations if 
it meets the criteria to be classified as held for sale (or is included in a disposal group that is 
classified as held for sale); 
(b) 
in accordance with AASB 16 if it is held by a lessee as a right-of-use asset and is not held for 
sale in accordance with AASB 5; and 
(c) 
in accordance with the requirements in AASB 116 for the cost model in all other cases. 
Transfers 
57 
An entity shall transfer a property to, or from, investment property when, and only when, there is a 
change in use. A change in use occurs when the property meets, or ceases to meet, the definition of 
investment property and there is evidence of the change in use. In isolation, a change in 
management’s intentions for the use of a property does not provide evidence of a change in use. 
Examples of evidence of a change in use include: 
(a) 
commencement of owner-occupation, or of development with a view to owner-occupation, 
for a transfer from investment property to owner-occupied property; 
(b) 
commencement of development with a view to sale, for a transfer from investment property 
to inventories; 
(c) 
end of owner-occupation, for a transfer from owner-occupied property to investment 
property; and 
(d) 
inception of an operating lease to another party, for a transfer from inventories to 
investment property. 
(e) 
[deleted] 
58 
When an entity decides to dispose of an investment property without development, it continues to treat the 
property as an investment property until it is derecognised (eliminated from the statement of financial 
position) and does not reclassify it as inventory. Similarly, if an entity begins to redevelop an existing 
investment property for continued future use as investment property, the property remains an investment 
property and is not reclassified as owner-occupied property during the redevelopment. 
59 
Paragraphs 60–65 apply to recognition and measurement issues that arise when an entity uses the fair value 
model for investment property. When an entity uses the cost model, transfers between investment property, 
owner-occupied property and inventories do not change the carrying amount of the property transferred and 
they do not change the cost of that property for measurement or disclosure purposes. 
60 
For a transfer from investment property carried at fair value to owner-occupied property or 
inventories, the property’s deemed cost for subsequent accounting in accordance with AASB 116, 
AASB 16 or AASB 102 shall be its fair value at the date of change in use. 
61 
If an owner-occupied property becomes an investment property that will be carried at fair value, an 
entity shall apply AASB 116 for owned property and AASB 16 for property held by a lessee as a 
right-of-use asset up to the date of change in use. The entity shall treat any difference at that date 
between the carrying amount of the property in accordance with AASB 116 or AASB 16 and its fair 
value in the same way as a revaluation in accordance with AASB 116.  
62 
Up to the date when an owner-occupied property becomes an investment property carried at fair value, an 
entity depreciates the property (or the right-of-use asset) and recognises any impairment losses that have 
occurred. The entity treats any difference at that date between the carrying amount of the property in 
accordance with AASB 116 or AASB 16 and its fair value in the same way as a revaluation in accordance 
with AASB 116. In other words:  
Authorised Version F2023C00417 registered 08/05/2023

AASB 140-compiled 
12 
STANDARD 
(a) 
any resulting decrease in the carrying amount of the property is recognised in profit or loss. 
However, to the extent that an amount is included in revaluation surplus for that property, the 
decrease is recognised in other comprehensive income and reduces the revaluation surplus within 
equity. 
(b) 
any resulting increase in the carrying amount is treated as follows: 
(i) 
to the extent that the increase reverses a previous impairment loss for that property, the 
increase is recognised in profit or loss. The amount recognised in profit or loss does not 
exceed the amount needed to restore the carrying amount to the carrying amount that 
would have been determined (net of depreciation) had no impairment loss been 
recognised. 
(ii) 
any remaining part of the increase is recognised in other comprehensive income and 
increases the revaluation surplus within equity. On subsequent disposal of the 
investment property, the revaluation surplus included in equity may be transferred to 
retained earnings. The transfer from revaluation surplus to retained earnings is not 
made through profit or loss. 
63 
For a transfer from inventories to investment property that will be carried at fair value, any 
difference between the fair value of the property at that date and its previous carrying amount shall 
be recognised in profit or loss. 
64 
The treatment of transfers from inventories to investment property that will be carried at fair value is 
consistent with the treatment of sales of inventories. 
65 
When an entity completes the construction or development of a self-constructed investment property 
that will be carried at fair value, any difference between the fair value of the property at that date 
and its previous carrying amount shall be recognised in profit or loss. 
Disposals 
66 
An investment property shall be derecognised (eliminated from the statement of financial position) on 
disposal or when the investment property is permanently withdrawn from use and no future 
economic benefits are expected from its disposal. 
67 
The disposal of an investment property may be achieved by sale or by entering into a finance lease. The 
date of disposal for investment property that is sold is the date the recipient obtains control of the 
investment property in accordance with the requirements for determining when a performance obligation is 
satisfied in AASB 15. AASB 16 applies to a disposal effected by entering into a finance lease and to a sale 
and leaseback. 
68 
If, in accordance with the recognition principle in paragraph 16, an entity recognises in the carrying amount 
of an asset the cost of a replacement for part of an investment property, it derecognises the carrying amount 
of the replaced part. For investment property accounted for using the cost model, a replaced part may not be 
a part that was depreciated separately. If it is not practicable for an entity to determine the carrying amount 
of the replaced part, it may use the cost of the replacement as an indication of what the cost of the replaced 
part was at the time it was acquired or constructed. Under the fair value model, the fair value of the 
investment property may already reflect that the part to be replaced has lost its value. In other cases it may 
be difficult to discern how much fair value should be reduced for the part being replaced. An alternative to 
reducing fair value for the replaced part, when it is not practical to do so, is to include the cost of the 
replacement in the carrying amount of the asset and then to reassess the fair value, as would be required for 
additions not involving replacement.  
69 
Gains or losses arising from the retirement or disposal of investment property shall be determined as 
the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and shall be 
recognised in profit or loss (unless AASB 16 requires otherwise on a sale and leaseback) in the period 
of the retirement or disposal.  
70 
The amount of consideration to be included in the gain or loss arising from the derecognition of an 
investment property is determined in accordance with the requirements for determining the transaction price 
in paragraphs 47–72 of AASB 15. Subsequent changes to the estimated amount of the consideration 
included in the gain or loss shall be accounted for in accordance with the requirements for changes in the 
transaction price in AASB 15. 
71 
An entity applies AASB 137 or other Standards, as appropriate, to any liabilities that it retains after disposal 
of an investment property.

Compensation from third parties for investment property that was impaired, lost or given up shall be 
recognised in profit or loss when the compensation becomes receivable.  
73 
Impairments or losses of investment property, related claims for or payments of compensation from third 
parties and any subsequent purchase or construction of replacement assets are separate economic events and 
are accounted for separately as follows:  
(a) 
impairments of investment property are recognised in accordance with AASB 136; 
(b) 
retirements or disposals of investment property are recognised in accordance with paragraphs 66–
71 of this Standard; 
(c) 
compensation from third parties for investment property that was impaired, lost or given up is 
recognised in profit or loss when it becomes receivable; and 
(d) 
the cost of assets restored, purchased or constructed as replacements is determined in accordance 
with paragraphs 20–29 of this Standard.

Fair value model and cost model 
74 
The disclosures below apply in addition to those in AASB 16. In accordance with AASB 16, the owner of 
an investment property provides lessors’ disclosures about leases into which it has entered. A lessee that 
holds an investment property as a right-of-use asset provides lessees’ disclosures as required by AASB 16 
and lessors’ disclosures as required by AASB 16 for any operating leases into which it has entered. 
75

84A 
AASB 2014-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards, issued in June 2014, amended the 
previous version of this Standard as follows: added paragraph 14A and a heading before paragraph 
6. An entity shall apply that amendment prospectively for acquisitions of investment property from 
the beginning of the first period for which it adopts that amendment. Consequently, accounting for 
acquisitions of investment property in prior periods shall not be adjusted. However, an entity may 
choose to apply the amendment to individual acquisitions of investment property that occurred prior 
to the beginning of the first annual period occurring on or after the effective date if, and only if, 
information needed to apply the amendment to those earlier transactions is available to the entity.

Transfers of investment property 
84C 
AASB 2017-1 Amendments to Australian Accounting Standards – Transfers of Investment Property, Annual 
Improvements 2014–2016 Cycle and Other Amendments, issued in February 2017, amended paragraphs 57–
58. An entity shall apply those amendments to changes in use that occur on or after the beginning of the 
annual reporting period in which the entity first applies the amendments (the date of initial application). At 
the date of initial application, an entity shall reassess the classification of property held at that date and, if 
applicable, reclassify property applying paragraphs 7–14 to reflect the conditions that exist at that date. 
84D 
Notwithstanding the requirements in paragraph 84C, an entity is permitted to apply the amendments to 
paragraphs 57–58 retrospectively in accordance with AASB 108 if, and only if, that is possible without the 
use of hindsight. 
84E 
If, in accordance with paragraph 84C, an entity reclassifies property at the date of initial application, the 
entity shall: 
(a) 
account for the reclassification applying the requirements in paragraphs 59–64. In applying 
paragraphs 59–64, an entity shall: 
(i) 
read any reference to the date of change in use as the date of initial application; and 
(ii) 
recognise any amount that, in accordance with paragraphs 59–64, would have been 
recognised in profit or loss as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
at the date of initial application. 
(b) 
disclose the amounts reclassified to, or from, investment property in accordance with paragraph 
84C. The entity shall disclose those amounts reclassified as part of the reconciliation of the 
carrying amount of investment property at the beginning and end of the period as required by

DELETED IAS 40 TEXT 
Deleted IAS 40 text 
Deleted IAS 40 text is not part of AASB 140. 
80 
An entity that has previously applied IAS 40 (2000) and elects for the first time to classify and 
account for some or all eligible property interests held under operating leases as investment property 
shall recognise the effect of that election as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
for the period in which the election is first made. In addition:  
(a) 
if the entity has previously disclosed publicly (in financial statements or otherwise) the fair 
value of those property interests in earlier periods (measured on a basis that satisfies the 
definition of fair value in IFRS 13), the entity is encouraged, but not required: 
(i) 
to adjust the opening balance of retained earnings for the earliest period 
presented for which such fair value was disclosed publicly; and 
(ii) 
to restate comparative information for those periods; and 
(b) 
if the entity has not previously disclosed publicly the information described in (a), it shall 
not restate comparative information and shall disclose that fact. 
81 
This Standard requires a treatment different from that required by IAS 8. IAS 8 requires comparative 
information to be restated unless such restatement is impracticable.  
82 
When an entity first applies this Standard, the adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings 
includes the reclassification of any amount held in revaluation surplus for investment property.  
83 
IAS 8 applies to any change in accounting policies that is made when an entity first applies this Standard 
and chooses to use the cost model. The effect of the change in accounting policies includes the 
reclassification of any amount held in revaluation surplus for investment property. 
84 
The requirements of paragraphs 27–29 regarding the initial measurement of an investment property 
acquired in an exchange of assets transaction shall be applied prospectively only to future 
transactions. 
85A 
IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements (as revised in 2007) amended the terminology used throughout 
IFRSs. In addition it amended paragraph 62. An entity shall apply those amendments for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 January 2009. If an entity applies IAS 1 (revised 2007) for an earlier period, the 
amendments shall be applied for that earlier period. 
85C 
IFRS 13, issued in May 2011, amended the definition of fair value in paragraph 5, amended paragraphs 26, 
29, 32, 40, 48, 53, 53B, 78–80 and 85B and deleted paragraphs 36–39, 42–47, 49, 51 and 75(d). An entity 
shall apply those amendments when it applies IFRS 13. 
86 
This Standard supersedes IAS 40 Investment Property (issued in 2000).
