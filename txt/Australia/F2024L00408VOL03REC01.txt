DEVELOPMENT OF POLICY – OPPORTUNITIES AND 
CONSTRAINTS
8.1 IMPLICATIONS ARISING FROM SIGNIFICANCE
Based on the statement of significance for Anzac Parade presented in Chapter 7, the 
following management implications arise.
The following attributes should be conserved:
•
Anzac Parade overall;
•
commemorative activities, at each memorial and in Anzac Parade as a whole;
•
Anzac Parade as a public and accessible space;
•
individual memorials, including as designed spaces that engage those who enter;
•
New Zealand Memorial;
•
relationship to the overall Land Axis and Australian War Memorial;
•
formal symbolic landscape, including symmetry and plant use/selection to express 
this;
•
openness of the Parade;
•
views up and down the Parade along the Land Axis;
•
the red colour of the median, both visually and symbolically, including the crushed 
brick paving;
•
the contrast between the openness of the Parade and the tall, enclosing eucalypts that 
edge the Parade;  and
•
street lighting.
These implications do not automatically lead to a given conservation policy in Chapter 9.  
There are a range of other factors that must also be considered in the development of 
policy, and these are considered in the rest of this chapter.  Such factors may modify the 
implications listed above to produce a different policy outcome.
8.2 LEGISLATIVE REQUIREMENTS
The management of Anzac Parade operates within a legislative and quasi-legislative 
framework which includes the:
•
Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 
(Commonwealth);
•
Public Unleased Land Act 2013 (ACT);
•
Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (Commonwealth);
•
National Memorials Ordinance 1928 (Commonwealth);
•
Copyright Amendment (Moral Rights) Act 2000 (Commonwealth);  and
•
Building Code of Australia.
In addition, there are a range of relevant subsidiary plans and policies.  This framework 
and relevant elements are briefly described below.

Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988 
(Commonwealth)
Overview
The Act establishes the National Capital Authority, and requires the NCA to prepare and 
administer a National Capital Plan (National Capital Authority 2016).  The National 
Capital Plan defines Designated Areas and sets out detailed policies for land use and 
detailed conditions for planning, design and development within them.  Works approval 
must be obtained from the NCA for all ‘works’ proposed within a Designated Area.
Anzac Parade is part of the Central National Area – Constitution Avenue and Anzac 
Parade Precinct, and the area is a Designated Area as defined in the National Capital Plan.  
Therefore all ‘works’ affecting the area require written approval from the NCA.
As noted in Section 2.1, the street verges on Anzac Park East and West are contiguous 
with Anzac Park although they are not part of the National Heritage place, and these areas 
are Territory Land subject to the Public Unleased Land Act 2013 (ACT) discussed below.
The following section provides a brief overview of the National Capital Plan.  However, 
the NCA also has an asset management role and this is separately described in Section 8.4.
It should be noted that the NCA is subject to the scrutiny of the Joint Standing Committee 
on the National Capital and External Territories of the Commonwealth Parliament.  The 
Committee has the power to inquire into the NCA.
National Capital Authority and National Capital Plan
The object of the plan (National Capital Authority 2016) is to ensure that Canberra and the 
ACT are planned and developed in accordance with their national significance.  In 
particular, the plan seeks to preserve and enhance the special characteristics and those 
qualities of the National Capital which are of national significance.
The plan describes the broad pattern of land use to be adopted in the development of 
Canberra and other relevant matters of broad policy.  The plan also sets out detailed 
conditions for the planning, design and development of National Land which includes 
Anzac Parade.  As noted above, works within a Designated Area require written approval 
from the NCA and must meet these detailed conditions.  Such works include:
•
the construction, alteration, extension or demolition of buildings or structures;
•
landscaping;
•
tree removal;  and
•
excavations.
Specific relevant sections of the plan include:
•
general heritage objectives and principles (National Capital Plan, Sections 2.4.3-
2.4.4);
•
principles and policies for the Central National Area, and the Parliamentary Zone 
and its Setting (National Capital Plan, Sections 4.1 and 4.2);
•
detailed conditions of planning, design and development for these areas (National 
Capital Plan, Sections 4.1 and 4.2);
•
Constitution Avenue and Anzac Parade Precinct Code, also including detailed 
conditions of planning, design and development (National Capital Plan, Section 
4.8);
•
design and siting general code (National Capital Plan, Section 4.19);  and

signs general code (National Capital Plan, Section 4.20).
Key extracts from the plan are provided below or reproduced at Appendix E.
The plan provides extensive and detailed guidance on a wide variety of matters.  It is 
difficult to distill the relevant guidance however, its scope includes:
•
the role of the capital;
•
preferred uses;
•
character to be achieved/maintained;
•
hydraulics and water quality;
•
access;
•
development conditions, including scale of development;
•
parking and traffic arrangements;
•
standard and nature of building, and urban design and siting, including landscaping;
•
management planning for features;
•
heritage places;
•
signage;
•
maintenance and management of the lake;  and
•
infrastructure.
Key principles and policies
Key principles provided in the plan include,
‘The planning and development of the National Capital will seek to respect and enhance the 
main principles of Walter Burley Griffins’ formally adopted plan for Canberra…
The Parliamentary Zone and its setting remain the heart of the National Capital.  In this area, 
priority will be given to the development of buildings and associated structures which have 
activities and functions that symbolise the Capital and through it the nation.  Other 
developments in the area should be sited and designed to support the prominence of these 
national functions and reinforce the character of the area.’  (NCA 2016, p. 49)
It also provides a number of policies, of which a key one is as follows.
‘Major national functions and activities that are closely connected with workings of Parliament 
or are of major national significance should be located in or adjacent to the National 
Triangle…’  (NCA 2016, p. 49)
Land uses
Land use in Anzac Parade is Open Space, in the case of Anzac Park, and otherwise road 
reservations (NCA 2016, p. 117, reproduced in Appendix E).
Constitution Avenue and Anzac Parade Indicative Development Plan
An indicative development plan for Constitution Avenue and Anzac Parade is also 
provided in the National Capital Plan (NCA 2016, p. 129).  The plan provides a vision for 
development consistent with the National Capital Plan, however much of it relates to 
Constitution Avenue rather than Anzac Parade.  None the less, a few points to note 
include:
•
extensive and largely continuous multi-storey buildings in the land between Parkes 
Way and Constitution Avenue, including possibly 7-8 storey development on land to 
the east of Anzac Parade on Constitution Avenue;  and
•
Anzac Parade will continue to operate as a main avenue.

Public Unleased Land Act 2013 (ACT)
This Act protects the amenity and natural value of public unleased Territory land, and 
facilitates the use of public unleased land.  It also relates to public roads.  The Act does not 
apply to National land.
This Act deals with the management and protection of the Anzac Park East and West road 
verges which are outside of but contiguous with Anzac Park and the National Heritage 
place.
Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999
Overview
This Act has certain relevant provisions relating to heritage places generally, and 
especially relating to places on the National Heritage List.  The Australian War Memorial 
and the Memorial Parade is entered in the National Heritage List.  As part of the 
Parliament House Vista, the Parade is also on the Commonwealth Heritage List.  Given the 
focus of this heritage management plan, only matters arising from the National Heritage 
listing are considered.
The EPBC Act requires approval from the Minister for the Environment for all actions 
likely to have a significant impact on matters protected under Part 3 of the Act.  This 
includes National Heritage (sections 15B and 15C), Commonwealth actions (section 28) 
and Commonwealth land (section 26).  Actions by the National Capital Authority may be 
Commonwealth actions and the Anzac Parade is Commonwealth land for the purposes of 
the Act.
The Act provides that actions:
•
taken which have, will have, or is likely to have a significant impact on National 
Heritage values will require the approval of the Minister for the Environment;
•
taken on Commonwealth land which are likely to have a significant impact on the 
environment will require the approval of the Minister;

•
taken outside Commonwealth land which are likely to have a significant impact on 
the environment on Commonwealth land, will require the approval of the Minister;  
and
•
taken by the Commonwealth or its agencies which are likely to have a significant 
impact on the environment anywhere will require approval by the Minister.
Significant impact in the case of National Heritage is defined as follows.
‘A ‘significant impact’ is an impact which is important, notable, or of consequence, having 
regard to its context or intensity.  Whether or not an action is likely to have a significant impact 
depends upon the sensitivity, value, and quality of the environment which is impacted, and 
upon the intensity, duration, magnitude and geographic extent of the impacts.  You should 
consider all of these factors when determining whether an action is likely to have a significant 
impact on matters of national environmental significance.’  (DoE 2013, p. 2)
The definition of 'environment' in the EPBC Act includes the heritage values of places, and 
this is understood to include those identified in the National Heritage List and possibly in 
other authoritative heritage lists.  The definition of ‘action’ is also important.  Action 
includes:
•
a project;
•
a development;
•
an undertaking;
•
an activity or series of activities;  and
•
an alteration of any of the things mentioned.
However, a decision by a government body to grant a governmental authorisation, 
however described, for another person to take an action is not an action for the purposes of 
the Act.  It is generally considered that a government authorisation entails, but is not 
limited to, the issuing of a license or permit under a legislative instrument.  (EPBC Act, 
Sections 523-4)
If a proposed action relating to National Heritage, on Commonwealth land or by a 
Commonwealth agency is likely to have a significant impact on National Heritage 
Values/the environment, it is necessary to make a referral under sections 68 or 71 of the 
EPBC Act.  The Minister is then required to decide whether or not the action needs 
approval under the Act, and to notify the person proposing to take the action of his or her 
decision.
In deciding the question of significant impact, section 75(2) of the EPBC Act states that 
the Minister can only take into account the adverse impacts of an action, and must not 
consider the beneficial impacts.  Accordingly, the benefits of a proposed action are not 
relevant in considering the question of significant impact and whether or not a referral 
should be made.
It is possible to obtain an exemption from seeking approval for an action if an accredited 
management plan is in place.  This plan is not an accredited management plan.
Other specific heritage provisions under the Act include:
•
the creation of a Commonwealth Heritage List and a National Heritage List;  and
•
special provisions regarding National Heritage (these are discussed below).
The EPBC Act is complex and significant penalties can apply to breaches of the Act.  
Accordingly, a cautious approach seems prudent.

National Heritage listing
As noted above, this list is established under the EPBC Act.  Anzac Parade is listed on the 
National Heritage List as part of a larger heritage place including the Australian War 
Memorial (see Appendix A).
National Heritage places are protected under specific provisions of the EPBC Act, and in 
addition there are other provisions related to Commonwealth actions and Commonwealth 
land – as described above.  There are also provisions requiring the Minister for the 
Environment to develop a management plan to manage places on the National Heritage 
List which are also within Commonwealth areas, consistent with the National Heritage 
Management Principles and management plan requirements prescribed in regulations to 
the Act.
Appendix G records how this heritage management plan complies with the various EPBC 
Act requirements.
These National Heritage obligations apply to the NCA in addition to the broader protective 
provisions for heritage places under the EPBC Act.
This plan takes into account the existing National Heritage values of the study area, and 
provides for the conservation of formally identified attributes.  To the extent that the plan 
provides a refined understanding of the heritage values of the area, it generally 
encompasses the existing National Heritage values and expands or extends the values.  A 
table in Appendix G notes the policies and strategies in this plan which are relevant to the 
conservation of the attributes.
A summary of the statutory and other heritage listings relevant to Anzac Parade is 
provided in the following table.

This Ordinance provides for the location and character of National Memorials in Canberra 
on National Land.  It establishes the Canberra National Memorials Committee which has 
the role of approving such memorials.
Any new memorials in Anzac Parade would require approval under this Ordinance.
Copyright Act 1968
This Act, amended in 2000, protects the moral rights of the creator of an art work 
(including a building), which includes architects, landscape architects and artists for 
designed aspects of Anzac Parade.  These moral rights are the unassignable personal right 
of the architects, landscape architects or artists to:
•
be acknowledged as the architect, landscape architect or artist for the designed 
aspects of the place as the case may be (right of attribution);  and
•
to object to derogatory treatment of the designed aspects, as the case may be (right of 
integrity).
These rights extend to the members of teams working on a design, where these members 
contribute to or have some authorship of the design.
Building Code of Australia
The Code, formally the National Construction Code, Volume 1, Building Code of 
Australia, is the definitive regulatory resource for building construction, providing a 
nationally accepted and uniform approach to technical requirements for the building 
industry.  It specifies matters relating to building work in order to achieve a range of health 
and safety objectives, including fire safety.
All building work in Anzac Parade should comply with the Code.  As far as possible, the 
NCA aims to achieve compliance with the Code, although this may not be entirely possible 
because of the nature of and constraints provided by existing circumstances.

8.3 STAKEHOLDERS
There is a range of stakeholders with an interest in and concern for Anzac Parade.  These 
include the:
•
large number of individuals, groups and communities with an association with Anzac 
Parade overall and/or with specific memorials, including Service Associations;
•
parts of the diplomatic community;
•
the range of other users of and visitors to the area;
•
Australian War Memorial;
•
Commonwealth department responsible for heritage, currently the Department of 
Agriculture, Water and the Environment;
•
Australian Heritage Council;
•
those people who hold moral rights regarding the designed elements of the area;
•
residents of adjacent suburbs, including their representative associations;
•
National Trust of Australia (ACT);  and
•
Walter Burley Griffin Society.
The interests of a few of these stakeholders are related to legislation which is separately 
described above.  The following text provides a brief description of the interests of the 
other stakeholders listed.
There are or may also be other organisations with an interest in the Parade, such as 
adjacent owners/managers of property, the Australian Institute of Landscape Architects, 
Planning Institute of Australia and the Reid Residents’ Association.  However, these 
possible interests have not been explored.
In addition, there may be other stakeholders related to the specific memorials.  While to 
some extent these stakeholders may fall into the general categories noted above, there may 
also be quite specific stakeholders with a very localised interest who are not.  Because this 
plan does not address the specific memorials in great detail, the full range of stakeholders 
for each of the memorials has also not been explored.
The National Capital Authority as the managing agency for the Parade and its interests are 
discussed in the following section.
It should be noted that much of this section derives from research undertaken for the 2013 
version of the heritage management plan.
Individuals, groups and communities with an association with Anzac Parade overall 
and/or with specific memorials, including Service Associations
There are many individuals, groups and communities who have a substantial association 
with Anzac Parade overall, and/or with the specific memorials along its length.  They 
include:
•
current and former Defence Force personnel;
•
the Royal Australian Navy, Australian Army and Royal Australian Air Force;
•
Returned and Services League of Australia (RSL);
•
Returned Sisters’ Association;
•
Naval Association of Australia, as well as other organisations/associations related to 
service in the Royal Australian Navy (eg. ship associations);
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

•
organisations/associations related to service in the Australian Army (eg. the Royal 
Australian Regiment Association);
•
RAAF Association, as well as other organisations/associations related to service in 
the RAAF (eg. squadron associations);
•
Australian Korean Council of Veterans;
•
Korean and South East Asian Forces Association;
•
Kindred Organisation Committee;
•
Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia;
•
Australian Peacekeeper and Peacemaker Veterans’ Association;  and
•
National Boer War Memorial Association.
Representatives from a number of these participated in the social and community aesthetic 
value research for this plan (see Chapter 4).  In the course of that research, a number of 
issues were raised which reflect the range of concerns for these individuals, groups and 
communities.  The issues relate to:
•
changes to memorials, including maintenance, which can cause anxiety amongst the 
armed services community.  Such actions should be undertaken after due 
consultation, and what is being undertaken should be well-communicated on-site (by 
signage) and through prior contact with the relevant organisations;
•
a lack of resources to support events in Anzac Parade that are initiated by the various 
armed service organisations is of concern, although this is not an issue for events 
undertaken by the three Defence services;
•
at present the groups associated with memorials need to raise funds to hold annual 
commemorative activities.  This can mean they are not able to publicise activities as 
widely as they would like to.  By comparison, the Australian War Memorial is very 
strong on activities and promotion via its website;
•
the level of support offered by the Australian War Memorial and the NCA is quite 
different, with less active support offered by the NCA.  Further, some organisations 
get active support from foreign governments (eg. the Republic of Korea), and both 
the Greek community and Embassy and the New Zealand High Commission support 
activities at specific memorials, and contribute to larger events such as Anzac Day;
•
traffic is an issue of concern, although there is an appreciation that access by car is 
important for those who cannot ‘walk the Parade’.  The need to fund traffic 
management is a major issue (eg. closing roads for ceremonies).  The roads interfere 
with ceremonies.  The form of the kerbing limits the area that can be easily used.  
With long-term thinking could Anzac Parade become a pedestrian mall?
•
the failure to play the New Zealand anthem at Anzac Day ceremonies;
•
school children and other tours should visit Anzac Parade;
•
the split in management responsibilities between Anzac Parade and the Australian 
War Memorial is a problem – leading to inconsistent interpretation, a failure to link 
the interpretation across the two places – could the Australian War Memorial manage 
all events for Anzac Parade but not otherwise manage the place?
•
the opportunity to engage members of the armed services community in the 
interpretation;
•
using the memorials more – make it easier to hold commemorations there – it is now 
easy to hold commemorations in the Australian War Memorial – which may reduce 
demand for additional memorials along Anzac Parade (eg. Battle of Britain 
commemorations could be held at the RAAF memorial) – encourage veterans 
organisations to get behind this idea;
•
further memorialisation within Anzac Parade – there is a desire to maintain the 
valued attributes of the place, a desire to retain memorialisation within a defined area 
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
because this offers due respect and recognition, a corresponding dislike of the idea 
that future memorials could be relegated to another place unless that place had 
particular relevance, noting that some memorials have been designed to allow the 
addition of extra information, a general view that the Australian War Memorial is 
where the Roll of Honour should be, a desire to retain the focus of memorials and 
Anzac Parade as a place to remember people rather than a ‘service’ or conflict;
•
suggestions on future memorialisation included virtual memorials and memorial 
paving;  and
•
the need for facilities – water bubblers, covered seating, parking and toilets.
Parts of the diplomatic community
Because of the nature of some of the memorials, parts of the diplomatic community have a 
strong connection to these memorials and possibly to Anzac Parade overall.  This includes 
the:
•
New Zealand High Commission;
•
Embassy of Greece;
•
Turkish Embassy;  and
•
Embassy of the Republic of Korea.
In general, these parts of the diplomatic community provide support for and participate in 
commemorative activities, and have an ongoing interest in the memorials and such 
activities.  They also have an interest in the use and interpretation of memorials, and in 
supporting associated communities and their connections to memorials.
Other users and visitors
Anzac Parade attracts a wide range of people for a variety of reasons.  Many of these 
include the stakeholders discussed above.  In addition, there are other users and visitors 
who come to the Parade particularly for sight-seeing and tourism reasons, but also for 
recreation such as walking or jogging.
General issues likely to be of concern include:
•
access to interpretive materials;
•
access for users and visitors, including by public and private transport, by car and 
bus;
•
parking for users and visitors;
•
facilities for users and visitors (eg. toilets and food outlets);
•
coordination in the case of major events;  and
•
developments or adjacent developments affecting the Parade, including construction-
phase impacts.
In addition, Anzac Parade is a significant thoroughfare for commuters passing through the 
area.  While information about their interests have not emerged through the research, it is 
assumed commuters have at least a utilitarian interest in the Parade associated with travel, 
perhaps coupled with an appreciation of the aesthetic qualities of the landscape.

Australian War Memorial
The Australian War Memorial has a powerful presence at the head of Anzac Parade and 
has a very strong relationship to the Parade.  Anzac Parade forms part of the ceremonial 
space for major events held at the Australian War Memorial, such as the Anzac Day 
Veterans’ March.  It is also part of the significant vistas to and from the Australian War 
Memorial.  As an organisation, the Australian War Memorial is keenly interested in Anzac 
Parade.
There is also a strong visitor experience link between the Parade and the AWM – for 
example veterans’ groups may hold a ceremony at a specific memorial along the Parade 
and then move up to the AWM for other activities.  School groups also tend to start with 
the Parade and then afterwards visit the AWM.
There is a complementarity of commemorative activities between the Australian War 
Memorial and Anzac Parade, given the opportunity to place commemorative plaques and 
other features within the grounds of the AWM.  The grounds have become the location for 
many smaller commemorative features, as well as some larger features, while the Parade is 
generally the location for more substantial memorials.  One recent larger commemorative 
feature located in the AWM grounds is the National Service Memorial which was 
dedicated in 2010.
There have been connections between the public programs of the AWM and Anzac Parade 
in the past, although these have not continued.
Current or past issues have included:
•
pedestrian access between the AWM and Anzac Parade, and the need to cross the 
wide and reasonably busy Fairbairn and Limestone Avenues.  The pedestrian lights 
create a bottleneck;
•
some variability in maintenance standards for the Parade over time, especially 
compared to the AWM;
•
a past proposal for new First World War and Second World War memorials in Anzac 
Parade;
•
the design of traffic infrastructure in Anzac Parade;
•
development of Section 5, Campbell, adjacent to the study area;  and
•
provision of visitor facilities in Anzac Parade, especially toilets.
In an inquiry about National Memorials, the AWM made the following general 
recommendation regarding Anzac Parade,
‘The Australian War Memorial would welcome being consulted and its advice sought for any device 
being contemplated along and beyond the ANZAC Parade axis.’  (Australian War Memorial 
submission to the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories Inquiry 
into the administration of the National Memorials Ordinance 1928, September 2011)
Moral rights holders
There are a range of architects, landscape architects, artists and possibly other designers 
who may hold moral rights over Anzac Parade overall or specific parts of it.
The full list of potential moral rights holders has not been researched, in particular 
regarding the many individual memorials.

Residents of adjacent suburbs, including their representative associations
The residents of Reid and Campbell live adjacent to Anzac Parade, many close to or 
immediately opposite it.  Accordingly, activities within the parade can be of considerable 
interest to these residents.
In a similar way, the representative associations of residents from these suburbs may be 
considered as focal points for these interests.  The relevant associations are the Reid 
Residents’ Association and Campbell Community Association.
National Trust of Australia (ACT)
The Trust is a community-based heritage conservation organisation.  It maintains a register 
of heritage places, and generally operates as an advocate for heritage conservation.  Listing 
on the Trust's register carries no statutory power, though the Trust is an effective public 
advocate in the cause of heritage.
The Trust has registered Anzac Parade.
The Trust is keenly interested in developments within Anzac Parade as well as 
developments outside the Parade which might have an impact on the place itself.  It has 
been active in commenting on such developments.
Walter Burley Griffin Society
The Society commemorates the lives and works of Walter Burley Griffin and Marion 
Mahony Griffin, and promotes the environmental ideals and community life they fostered 
in Australia.  It also actively promotes the conservation of the Griffins' legacy in its diverse 
forms and on three continents – America, Australia and India.  This includes places they 
designed that were built and survive, their designs, unrealised projects, plans, articles and 
talks given.
The Society has been keenly interested in developments within Anzac Parade, as an 
important element of the Griffin plan for Canberra, as well as developments outside the 
Parade which might have an impact on the place itself.  It has previously been active in 
commenting on such developments.

8.4 MANAGEMENT CONTEXT, REQUIREMENTS AND ASPIRATIONS
This section deals with:
•
current NCA management structure and systems;
•
uses and users of Anzac Parade;
•
interpretation;
•
management issues, including traffic and the road system;  and
•
future requirements and aspirations.
Current NCA management structure and systems
Anzac Parade and its memorials are generally the responsibility of and managed by the 
National Capital Authority.
General management framework
The NCA is an Australian Government statutory authority established under the Australian 
Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 1988.  This Act is briefly 
described in Section 8.2 above, especially with regard to the National Capital Plan and the 
works approval role of the NCA.
The NCA undertakes design, development and asset management for some of the National 
Capital's most culturally significant landscapes and national attractions, including Anzac 
Parade, as well as for other assets located on National Land.  Asset management is a key 
aspect in meeting the NCA’s commitment to maintaining high-quality public facilities 
across the National Capital Estate.
The NCA has an asset management policy underpinned by a strategic asset management 
plan.  Asset management plans for each asset class are updated regularly and provide more 
detailed tasks and activities that are undertaken by the NCA.
In managing its assets, the NCA aims to ensure that maintenance and repair are consistent 
with their design intent, and support the objectives of the National Capital Plan.
The NCA has a management structure relevant to Anzac Parade.  In the 2018-19 financial 
year the NCA’s overall expenditure was $57.9 million and it had 69 ongoing and non-
ongoing employees.
Day-to-day management, maintenance and operation
The Estate Management Unit has responsibility for all aspects of asset management on 
National Land.  The Design and Construction Unit delivers the NCA's capital works 
program.  Works can include regular maintenance, works to enhance or protect national 
assets, construction of public infrastructure, and development of the landscape settings for 
new building sites, public parks and places, commemoration and celebration.
The Estate Management Unit has responsibility for the management and maintenance of 
Anzac Parade.  The Parade is maintained under contracts for various components or 
classes of work, and relate to the:
•
landscape (irrigation systems, hard surfaces, plants, lawn and garden areas);
•
treescape;
•
cleaning;  and
•
memorials, artworks and fountains.

The NCA has appointed a managing contractor for achieving service standards for 
maintenance across all NCA managed buildings, roads, paths, lighting and utilities to 
ensure community safety is protected.  This includes for the Parade.
The National Capital Activation and Events Unit manages events undertaken by others on 
the Parade, which are mostly related to commemorative activities.
Works approval
The Statutory Planning and Heritage Unit has a role in assessing and, where appropriate, 
providing works approval under the National Capital Plan, as discussed in Section 8.2 
above.
Heritage management plans and Guidelines for Commemorative Works
Another layer of management guidance for significant places relevant to the Parade are 
several heritage management plans.  The relevant plans are for the:
•
Parliament House Vista (Marshall and others 2010b), which includes Anzac Parade;  
and
•
for the Australian War Memorial (GML Heritage 2022), being adjacent to the Parade 
and the other part of the single National Heritage place which includes the Parade.
The guidance provided in these plans has been taken into account in the development of 
conservation policies and strategies in Section 9.3 below, with the aim of achieving 
consistency and compatibility.
In addition, the NCA has developed guidelines for commemorative works in the National 
Capital (NCA 2002).  These guidelines provide a range of objectives, values and general 
criteria for commemorative subjects, as well as defining the type of memorials that can be 
sited in Anzac Parade,
‘Memorials that commemorate Australian Defence Force service in all wars or warlike operations.’  
(NCA 2002, p. 13)
Uses and users of Anzac Parade
The study area is used by a range of users for a range of uses, and these are described in 
the preceding section regarding stakeholders.  There are individuals, groups and 
communities who use either part of the Parade, such as an individual memorial, or those 
who use the whole space for commemorative activities.  Apart from the major events such 
as Anzac Day ceremonies, about five other smaller commemorative activities take place 
each year which require NCA involvement.  Some small activities may not involve the 
NCA.
There are others who are tourists, as well as recreational users, who visit or use the Parade 
and its memorials.
Many of these uses have formed strong associations that are now recognised as part of the 
significance of the study area, as discussed in Chapter 4.

Interpretation
Overall, Anzac Parade, as well as its component memorials, are major public attractions in 
Canberra.  They are also the focus of several simple interpretive activities provided by the 
National Capital Authority.  These include:
•
information on the NCA’s website;
•
guided walking tours, promoted on the NCA’s and Visit Canberra website;
•
inclusion of material in a secondary education kit;  and
•
a self-guided walking tour brochure available from various outlets as well as the 
NCA’s website;

Key management issues 
The NCA is aware of a range of management issues relating to Anzac Parade.  These 
include:
•
managing the range of issues related to current and possible future memorials, 
including the limited current number of memorial niches, and possible changes and 
upgrades to existing memorials;
•
tree management including occasional replacement plantings, and ensuring screening 
of the memorials from developments adjacent to the Parade (see below);
•
addressing the poor condition of the Hebe species in the planter beds along Anzac 
Parade (see below);
•
visitor safety issues;
•
environmental sustainability of the landscape, including water use and weed 
management;
•
access for visitors, including by public and private transport, by car and bus;
•
pathway access to the memorials from Anzac Park East and West;
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

•
parking for visitors;
•
facilities for visitors (eg. toilets, water points and rest places);
•
the use of temporary tent structures on the Parade related to commemorative 
activities;
•
signage, including traffic, tourism and interpretive signs;
•
outdoor ceremonial functions;  and
•
construction-phase impacts.
In the case of individual memorials, specialist materials conservators are used as needed.  
Potential issues relate to the performance of glass panels at the Nurses’ memorial, and the 
arrangements with the pump equipment at the Navy memorial.
It should be noted that there are no proposals for any divestment of land within the study 
area, no special security issues or requirements, and no confidential information beyond 
normal commercial and government activities.
Tree management
In the past, it was thought that the plantations would need to be replaced because of the 
poor health of the trees.  However, in 2014 the NCA took a pragmatic approach which lay 
in basic sustainable horticultural practices, in the hope that this would improve the 
condition of the trees.  A program was undertaken consisting of:
•
selective tree removal and replacement;
•
removal of wildlings;
•
coring and composting the soil;  and
•
deep mulching of the plantation.
This has resulted in the remaining trees bouncing back to reasonably good health, with 
only one tree requiring removal in 2019.  It is noted that the majority of trees, even in the 
middle of a drought, are in fair to good condition.
Selective removal and replacement will continue as required, although extensive 
replacement is not anticipated.  This includes the removal of trees in poor condition over 
the longer term to re-establish the original planting pattern.  However, the depth of the 
mulch layer is diminishing and will require further replenishment soon.
The trees will require more management and maintenance in coming years as they age, and 
a landscape management plan (detailed below) should be prepared to guide this.  At 
present there are no guidelines for tree management and maintenance, although the health 
of the plantation is assessed annually.
The NCA is also currently developing a tree management policy which will be a higher 
level policy document related to the management of all trees within the NCA’s estate.  
This should also provide a broad framework for management of the plantations.
Landscape Maintenance Plans
It is suggested that achieving more consistent maintenance for both the broader landscape 
and its individual components would require the development of one or more landscape 
maintenance plans.  Such plans, possibly for each type of landscape within the place, 
would provide clear objectives and outcomes, methods, guidance, predictability, continuity

8.5 CONDITION AND INTEGRITY
The condition and integrity of Anzac Parade is discussed in this section.  It begins with an 
overview of its condition and integrity, and this is followed by more detail about the 
attributes of the study area.  After this, there is a discussion about two particular issues.
In this plan, the condition of values is presented in terms of the condition of attributes 
which embody those values.
Overview
Anzac Parade is a reasonably large landscape and in broad terms, the area is in fair 
condition and displays a high level of integrity.  However, there is some variability 
amongst components, with some being in good condition and others being in poor to very 
poor condition, and with some variability in the integrity of components.
Condition and integrity of attributes
In the following table, condition relates to the state of the attribute, often the physical state 
– for example an original gravel path which is badly eroded would be a condition issue.  
Integrity relates to the intactness of the attribute – for example a modern cobblestone path 
replacing an original gravel path might be an integrity issue irrespective of its condition.  It 
is often useful to distinguish between these matters, especially as integrity relates closely 
to significance.
Given the reasonably large nature of some of the components listed in the table, the 
judgments about condition and integrity are made on a broad basis.  Within these 
components there may also be considerable variation in the condition and integrity.
The attributes in the table are listed in the order derived from the statement of significance 
in Section 7.1.  In the case of individual memorials, these were not assessed in detail as 
part of this plan.

General condition issues
A number of general conditions issues were noted during inspections of the place:
•
deterioration of bronze memorial identification signs;
•
timber seat paintwork deteriorated;
•
irrigated grass is patchy in places;
•
mulch cover is thin in places;  and
•
concrete joints sealant deteriorated.
Plantings
Eucalyptus plantations
A number of issues associated with the plantations (primarily dead, diseased, dying or 
dangerous trees) and various management issues have been identified in previous reports 
over the years.  There have also been gaps in the plantings because of losses, and 
wildlings.  Many issues have now been addressed.
The condition of the individual Blue Gum trees varies, but in general the tree asset is in a 
fair to good condition (95%) based on a 2018 survey.  Tree health is assessed annually.  
They have undergone a significant management program since 2014, which has:
•
seen their soil cored and enriched with large amounts of composted material;
•
the surface mulched extensively to 100 mm;
•
wildlings removed;  and

•
dead trees systematically removed and replaced.

bicostata, 2019

However, the trees will require a continuous management and maintenance program in 
coming years as rainfall and temperatures vary and the soil profile breaks down from time 
to time.  This can be achieved by a landscape management plan for the plantation, as at 
present there are no guidelines for the maintenance or management of the plantation.
Native grasses
There has been limited success in the establishment of an understorey of native grasses due 
to several factors, most notably:
•
the lack of sufficient direct sunlight in their chosen locations;  and
•
the species used.
Establishment has been poor where the tree canopy is heavy and competition is high.

Hebe plantings
In 2012, the Hebes which had previously performed poorly were replaced with a new 
cultivar namely Hebe ‘Otari delight’.  This was implemented over a period between late 
2011 and November 2012 and handed over to NCA in November 2013 after a 12 month 
consolidation period.
The replacement cultivar was chosen after a trial was run of two species over a six month 
period which included the summer months.
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
In general terms, the re-planting has mostly been unsuccessful, and a separate review has 
been commissioned by the NCA into the reasons for this outcome.  The review has found 
that the plants have performed poorly because of several soil-borne diseases and other 
contributing factors.
The NCA will develop a replacement strategy, including a comprehensive manual for 
ongoing maintenance which will address any lessons learnt from the recent investigation 
which led to the discovery of the diseases.  Further laboratory testing is also proposed to 
help ascertain the heat tolerance of the plants so that appropriate details can be added to the 
manual.  Protocols to minimise the future introduction of diseases will be documented.
Full replacement of the plants is required due to the diseases being expected to be located 
throughout the soil profile of each bed, right down to the drainage layer.  All materials and 
equipment will need to be removed and/or sterilised, with careful quality assurance with 
regards to all replacement materials and products.
A number of the critical lessons learnt from the recent investigation will be documented in 
the maintenance manual:
•
ensuring appropriate irrigation timing, frequency and monitoring;
•
ensuring sufficient mulch;
•
minimising the opportunity for clay pans to form in the planter bed soil profile;
•
ensuring that soil chemistry is correctly balanced;
•
ensuring that plant spacing/clearance minimises the opportunity for diseases to 
flourish;
•
ensuring plant pruning is targeted to best enhance plant growth and presentation;  
and
•
documentation and introduction of a long-term and orderly replacement strategy to 
avert future major plant failures.
The following additional observations were made as a result of the development of this 
heritage management plan.
Planter beds
The planter beds are made of a concrete construction with a cantilevered top surround.  It 
is noted that the top of the planter beds sit approximately 400 mm above the ground.  It is 
understood that the soil within the beds is open to the ground below.
In the planter beds with the remaining plantings from 2012, the soil profile sits at 
approximately 150 mm below the top of the planter bed surround.
At some stage after 2013, the dripper irrigation system was turned off because of flooding 
issues and perimeter micro sprays on risers were installed.

In the planter beds with the remaining 2012 plantings, the following was observed;
•
Most of the plants are only at 350 to 400 mm centre to centre.
•
There are dead and dying plants in the middle and around the edges of the bed.
•
Many of the plants are only 75-100 mm from the edge of the planter bed wall.
•
The water from the micro sprays cannot reach the base of most plants.
•
There is no mulch evident in most beds.
•
There is a large amount of irrigation infrastructure impeding good root growth in the 
beds.
2019 planted beds
There are nine planter beds which have been replanted in 2019, and in these, the soil 
profile sits approximately 75 mm below the top of the planter bed surround, with a thin 
layer of tan bark as mulch, which sits approximately 50 mm below the top of the planter 
bed surround.

The planting layout is inconsistent across the nine planter beds.  Some beds have plants at 
450 to 500 mm centres, planted in a triangular pattern, whilst in others, there are rows
750 mm apart, and others with a linear planting pattern.  Additionally some beds have 
given plants more root space at the edge of the bed, with the planting space close to 350 
mm, whilst others are planted at approximately 100 mm from the edge.  There are both 
gaps and overcrowding of plants.

In the nine newly planted beds, the following was observed:
•
Most of the plants are at still 400 mm centres.  There are some at between 450 to 500 
mm apart.
•
There are different planting patterns in all nine beds.
•
There are variations in the number of plants in each bed due to different planting 
layouts.
•
The plant spacing is uneven.
•
The plants too close to the edge of the planter beds.
•
There is a large amount of irrigation infrastructure impeding good root growth in the 
beds.
•
The sprayers will still be blocked by full grown plants.
•
Spray will continue to be blown across Anzac Parade.
General environment for the plantings
The red gravel parade ground setting, together with the bitumen roads, is an exposed 
environment.  The eucalypts provide some shelter from cross winds.  However, in summer 
it experiences extreme temperatures being affected by hot summer drying northerly winds.  
In winter it is exposed to cold winds which blow from the southern alpine regions, and the 
area is exposed to frost.
Aesthetically, the pavement provides the necessary setting and visual cues such as colour, 
repetition, structure, order and practicality for the purpose for which it exists.  However, as 
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
an environment in which to grow plants successfully, it is now becoming very challenging.
Memorials
Over time the NCA has commissioned condition assessments of the various memorials, 
and these are generally provided as individual reports.  The details in these reports have 
not been considered in the preparation of this heritage management plan because the plan 
does not address the memorials in detail.
None the less, a number of observation were made during the course of preparing this plan 
about the condition of some of memorials:
•
Australian National Korean War Memorial – some dead plants/shrubs;
•
Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorial – minor damage to concrete ramp 
wall, broken granite paver;
•
Desert Mounted Corps Memorial – cracked, loose and missing slate pavers, rear 
drain blocked with leaf litter;
•
Boer War Memorial – minor cracking to the concrete paving;
•
New Zealand Memorial – in need of a minor tidy-up, removal of some weeds, and 
the recessed light pits cleaned out;
•
Australian Service Nurses National Memorial – pavement heaving, trip hazards, joint 
sealant deteriorated, dead shrubs;
•
Royal Australian Navy Memorial – rear screen plantings patchy/in poor condition;  
and
•
Kemal Ataturk Memorial – landscape plantings are patchy.
Boundary of the place
The current National Heritage place boundary stops at Constitution Avenue.  However, 
this excludes a section of Anzac Parade between the avenue and Parkes Way.  There is an 
arguable case that this short section should be included in the listed place, even if it is not 
used for the location of memorials.  It is part of Anzac Parade, and shares many of the 
same values as the remainder of the Parade.  Similarly, the street verges in Anzac Park 
East and West might also be included.  There is also an argument that Mount Ainslie 
should be part of the overall National Heritage listed place.

8.6 ISSUES RELATED TO THE BROADER SETTING
There are several other issues relating to the broader setting of Anzac Parade.  The broader 
setting is important to the values of the study area.
The National Capital Plan anticipates substantial change and development along 
Constitution Avenue, including between the avenue and Parkes Way.  As noted above, the 
nature of the Constitution Avenue roadway is expected to change as it becomes a more 
substantial road, and more intensive and taller development is planned along the avenue.
Figure 126.  Indicative Development Plan for Constitution Avenue and Anzac Parade
Source:  NCA 2016, p. 129
An earlier study related to the proposed developments along Constitution Avenue 
recommended plantings to help screen the developments (Lester Firth & Associates 2007, 
p. 14), as indicated below.

critical edges required to screen 
development between Parkes Way 
and Constitution Avenue

Consistent with this, development of Section 5 of Campbell, just to the east of Anzac 
Parade, is proceeding with some buildings already completed.

The National Capital Plan makes special mention of the Campbell development,
‘Particular attention should be given to the building form/façade at the corner of Anzac Parade East 
and Constitution Avenue. The design of buildings should be articulated using a variety of messing 
[sic]; solids and voids; and materials and colours to ameliorate any impacts on the adjacent National 
and Commonwealth Heritage listed places.
Buildings should not intrude on the public appreciation of the eastern handle of the New Zealand 
Memorial as the gateway to the Memorial Parade or interrupt the symmetrical characteristics of the 
East and West portal buildings in framing the Parliament House Vista.
The architectural design of the buildings on Site C must be sympathetic to the heritage values of the 
adjacent National and Commonwealth Heritage listed places.’  (NCA 2016, p. 133)
The National Capital Plan also includes details of the proposed landscape treatment behind 
the eastern part of the New Zealand Memorial in order to screen the new development 
from the Parade and provide a suitable backdrop for the memorial.  This is indicated in the 
following figure.

This screening work is yet to be undertaken, and the problem it seeks to address is very 
noticeable.  This problem also arises with several other memorials along the eastern side of 
the Parade, especially the Peacekeeping and Tobruk memorials, but also with the Navy 
memorial.  The current impact of the new developments along Anzac Park East are 
significant.  The new buildings dominate views from the Parade and diminish the 
appreciation of the memorials.

Anzac Park East intruding into

In addition, Anzac Park East has been demolished in anticipation of redevelopment of the 
site.  The success in preserving the symmetrical portal effect through this redevelopment, 
and that of Anzac Park West, should be a priority for the NCA as the planning authority 
for these sites.
There have also been various proposals to change the nature of Parkes Way over time, 
possibly including the Rond Pond.  However, no specific plans have yet been agreed.

CONSERVATION POLICY AND IMPLEMENTATION 
STRATEGIES
9.1 OBJECTIVE
The objective of this policy is to achieve the conservation of the National Heritage values 
of Anzac Parade, as part of the Australian War Memorial and the Memorial Parade 
National Heritage place.
This policy also seeks to complement the conservation policy provided in the Australian 
War Memorial Heritage Management Plan (GML Heritage 2022).
9.2 DEFINITIONS
The definitions for terms used in this plan are those adopted in the Burra Charter, The 
Australia ICOMOS Charter for places of cultural significance (Australia ICOMOS 2013), 
a copy of which is provided at Appendix F.  The Burra Charter is the national standard for 
cultural heritage conservation acknowledged by government heritage agencies around 
Australia.   Key definitions are provided below.
Place means a geographically defined area.  It may include elements, objects, spaces and views.  
Place may have tangible and intangible dimensions.
Cultural significance means aesthetic, historic, scientific, social or spiritual value for past, present or 
future generations.  Cultural significance is embodied in the place itself, its fabric, setting, use, 
associations, meanings, records, related places and related objects.
Fabric means all the physical material of the place including elements, fixtures, contents and objects.
Conservation means all the processes of looking after a place so as to retain its cultural significance 
[as listed below].
Maintenance means the continuous protective care of a place, and its setting.  Maintenance is to be 
distinguished from repair which involves restoration or reconstruction.
Preservation means maintaining a place in its existing state and retarding deterioration.
Restoration means returning a place to a known earlier state by removing accretions or by 
reassembling existing elements without the introduction of new material.
Reconstruction means returning a place to a known earlier state and is distinguished from restoration 
by the introduction of new material.
Adaptation means changing a place to suit the existing use or a proposed use. [Article 7.2 states 
regarding use that: a place should have a compatible use]
Compatible use means a use which respects the cultural significance of a place.  Such a use involves 
no, or minimal, impact on cultural significance.
Interpretation means all the ways of presenting the cultural significance of a place.

Australian War Memorial Heritage Management Plan
A review of the conservation policy in this plan for the Australian War Memorial (GML 
Heritage 2022) found that it complemented the following policy for Anzac Parade.  There 
are no apparent inconsistencies or gaps in policy coverage between the two plans.
Parliament House Vista Heritage Management Plan
A review of the conservation policy in this plan for the Vista (Marshall and others 2010) 
found that it complimented the following policy for Anzac Parade.  There are no apparent 
inconsistencies or gaps in policy coverage between the two plans.

Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
General Policies
Policy 1
Significance as the basis for management, planning and work
The statement of significance provided in Chapter 7 will be a principal basis 
for management, future planning and work affecting Anzac Parade.
Policy 2
Adoption of Burra Charter
The conservation and management of the place, its fabric and uses, will be 
carried out in accordance with the principles of the Burra Charter (Australia 
ICOMOS 2013), and any revisions of the Charter that might occur in the 
future.
Policy 3
Adoption of policies
The policies recommended in this management plan will be endorsed as a 
primary guide for management, as well as future planning and work for Anzac 
Parade.
Implementation Strategies
3.1
The NCA will adopt the priority and implementation timetable for 
policies and strategies which is indicated in Table 10.
Policy 4
Compliance with legislation
The NCA must comply with all relevant legislation and related instruments as 
far as possible, including the:
•
Australian Capital Territory (Planning and Land Management) Act 
1988;
•
Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999;
•
National Memorials Ordinance 1928;
•
Copyright Amendment (Moral Rights) Act 2000;  and
•
Building Code of Australia.
In addition, it must comply with relevant subsidiary requirements arising from 
this legislation and related instruments.
Implementation Strategies
4.1
The NCA will manage the formal National Heritage values of Anzac 
Parade consistent with the requirements of the EPBC Act.
Commentary:  The overall suite of policies and strategies in this plan 
help achieve this strategy.
4.2
The NCA will assist the Minister for the Environment comply with the 
obligations under section 324S of the EPBC Act and the related 
regulations to:
•
publish a notice about the making, amending or revoking of this 
plan;
•
advise the Minister about the making, amending or revoking of this 
plan;  and
•
seek and consider comments.
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
4.3
The NCA will consult with the Department of Agriculture, Water and the 
Environment about the apparent need for, and process to review the 
appropriateness of the current boundaries for Anzac Parade.
Commentary:  It is apparent the current boundaries of the National 
Heritage listed area may not be the most appropriate to fully capture the 
significance of the Parade.  The short section between Constitution 
Avenue and Parkes Way should be considered for inclusion.  It may also 
be desirable to include the street verges on Anzac Park East and West, as 
well as Mount Ainslie.
4.4
Where the NCA is not able to achieve full compliance with relevant 
legislation, the non-complying aspect will be noted and the reasons for 
this situation appropriately documented.
Commentary:  This might arise, for example, with regard to the Building 
Code of Australia.
Policy 5
Planning documents for or relevant to the Place
All planning documents developed for Anzac Parade or parts of the place will 
refer to this management plan as a primary guide for the conservation of the 
heritage values of the Parade.  The direction given in those documents and in 
this plan will be mutually compatible.
The NCA will promote acknowledgment and acceptance of the heritage values 
of the place through any conservation management planning or other planning 
for areas which are within, include or are adjacent to Anzac Parade.
Commentary
Components within Anzac Parade, especially the individual memorials, may at 
some stage be subject to separate conservation management plans.  In addition, 
the remainder of the National Heritage place, the Australian War Memorial, 
has a heritage management plan, and there is a plan for the overall Parliament 
House Vista which includes the Parade.
As noted, the guidance in this plan and in the plans for other relevant places 
should be compatible.
These other documents might have an impact on this management plan, and 
therefore lead to revisions in accordance with Policy 9.
It is also noted the Parliament House Vista plan proposes the development of a 
tree management plan and tree replacement strategy which need to be 
coordinated with this plan (PHV Policy 19 and Strategy 20.1).
Policy 6
Integrated management of components
The NCA will seek to achieve integrated management between the Parade and 
the Australian War Memorial, to ensure a consistent approach to management 
and commemoration, and engagement with and support for the armed services 
community.
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
Commentary:  This includes the full range of activities undertaken by 
management, including planning and interpretation.
Implementation Strategies
6.1
The NCA and Australian War Memorial should consider establishing an 
ongoing consultation mechanism to help achieve integrated management 
of the National Heritage place.
Policy 7
Training and access to expertise
People involved in the conservation, management, maintenance and 
interpretation of the place will be suitably qualified and receive training about 
the specific qualities and context of Anzac Parade.
The NCA will also ensure it uses suitable experts to advise on such matters.
Implementation Strategies
7.1
The NCA will develop and implement a simple training program for staff 
and contractors involved in the conservation, management, maintenance 
and interpretation of Anzac Parade.  The program will include 
information about the specific qualities and context of the place, 
including its protection under the EPBC Act.
7.2
People with relevant expertise and experience in the management or 
conservation of heritage properties will be engaged for the:
•
provision of advice on the resolution of conservation issues;
•
for advice on the design and review of work affecting the 
significance of the place;  and
•
to assist the NCA with statutory obligations (eg. heritage impact 
assessments).
7.3
The NCA will identify the names of people with relevant expertise and 
experience in the management or conservation of heritage properties, for 
actions implementing or extending this plan, and for other heritage 
related tasks.
Commentary:  Such names may be identified through professional bodies 
and the Commonwealth department responsible for heritage.
Policy 8
Decision making process for works or actions
The NCA will ensure that it has an effective and consistent decision-making 
process for works or actions affecting the place, which takes full account of the 
heritage significance of the place.  All such decisions will be suitably 
documented and these records kept for future reference.
Implementation Strategies
8.1The process will involve:
•
early consultation with internal and external stakeholders relevant 
to the particular decision, including consideration of the values 
held by associated communities not able to be directly consulted;
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
•
an understanding of the original and subsequent designs, and later 
changes to the place involved;
•
documentation of the proposed use or operational requirements 
justifying the works or action;  and
•
identification of relevant statutory obligations and steps undertaken 
to ensure compliance.
Commentary:  See Policy 11 regarding stakeholders.
8.2
The NCA will consider maintaining a log of actions with cross-
referencing to relevant documentation.
8.3
Where some work is not able to be undertaken because of resource 
constraints, work will be re-prioritised according to the following criteria 
to enable highest priority work to be undertaken within the available 
resources.  Prioritising work to heritage components or elements will be 
decided on the basis of:
•
in general terms, the descending order of priority for work will be 
maintenance, restoration, reconstruction, adaptation and new work, 
where such work is appropriate.  However, this priority order may 
be influenced by conditions attached to funding (eg. government 
decisions may tie funding to particular works);
•
work related to alleviating a high level of threat to significant 
aspects, or poor condition will be given the highest priority 
followed by work related to medium threat/moderate condition 
then low threat/good condition;  and
•
the level of threat/condition will be considered in conjunction with 
the degree of significance (for example aspects in poor condition 
and of moderate significance might be given a higher priority 
compared to aspects of moderate condition and high significance).
Commentary:  It is noted that new work/development by the NCA may 
be funded with conditions which override this policy.
8.4
If a conflict arises between the achievement of different objectives, the 
process for resolving this conflict will involve:
•
reference to the conflict resolution process outlined in the NCA’s 
Heritage Strategy;
•
implementation of a decision-making process in accordance with 
Policy 8;
•
compliance with the Burra Charter, in particular Articles 5.1 and 
13;
•
possibly involving heritage conservation experts in accordance 
with Policy 7;
•
possibly seeking the advice of the Department of Agriculture, 
Water and the Environment;  and
•
possibly seeking a decision from the Minister under the EPBC Act.
In the last case, a decision under Section 15B of the EPBC Act may be 
necessary because of the nature of the action involved.

Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
Commentary:  The outcome of this process may be a matter to be 
recorded in the NCA’s heritage register.
8.5
The implementation of this plan will be reviewed every second year, and 
the priorities re-assessed depending on resources or any other relevant 
factors.  The review will consider the degree to which policies and 
strategies have been met or completed in accordance with the timetable, 
as well as the actual condition of the place (Policies 3, 20 and 31).  The 
Criteria for Prioritising Work (Strategy 8.3) will be used if resource 
constraints do not allow the implementation of actions as programmed.
Policy 9
Review of the management plan
This management plan will be reviewed:
•
once every five years in accordance with section 324W of the EPBC Act;  
and
•
to take account of new information and ensure consistency with current 
management circumstances, again at least every five years;  or
•
whenever major changes to the place are proposed or occur by accident 
(such as fire or natural disaster);  or
•
when the management environment changes to the degree that policies 
are not appropriate to or adequate for changed management 
circumstances.
Implementation Strategies
9.1
The NCA will undertake a review of the management plan if it is found 
to be out of date with regards to significance assessment, management 
obligations or policy direction.
Commentary
While plans for National Heritage places are made by the Minister 
responsible for the EPBC Act, effectively the review of this plan will be 
undertaken by the NCA.
Conservation management planning for places which are part of, include 
or are adjacent to Anzac Parade may lead to changed circumstances and a 
need to review this plan.

Liaison
The following policies deal with a number of general relationships where liaison or 
consultation is required.  A few other specific consultations are dealt with in other policies 
(ie. Policies 4, 6, 8, 16, 32 and 40).  Importantly, the relationship with the Australian War 
Memorial is dealt with at Policy 6.
Policy 10
Relationship with the Commonwealth Department of Agriculture, Water and 
the Environment
The NCA will maintain regular contact with this Department, including 
informal consultations where appropriate, and formally refer any action that 
potentially impacts on any heritage values or places as required by the EPBC 
Act, and any amendments to this Act.
Implementation Strategies
10.1 The NCA may provide a copy of this plan to the Department for 
consideration of possible amendments to the National Heritage listing 
(values and boundaries), to better align that listing with the plan.
Policy 11
Relationship with associated groups and communities, and other 
stakeholders
The NCA will seek to liaise with associated groups and communities, and other 
relevant stakeholders, including community and professional groups, on 
developments affecting the place, including on adjacent land.  It will seek to 
actively consult prior to decisions directly impacting on the significance of 
Anzac Parade or its component parts to associated groups and communities.
Consultation and planning processes should be open/transparent, well-
communicated, and able to be understood by the associated groups and 
communities.
Commentary:  Refer to Strategy 8.1.
Implementation Strategies
11.1 The NCA will maintain a list of relevant stakeholders and the scope of 
their interests.
Commentary:  The stakeholders listed in Section 8.3 are relevant 
stakeholders which will be included in the proposed list.
11.2 Periodically or as developments are proposed, the NCA will seek to 
inform stakeholders of activities in a timely fashion and provide them 
with an opportunity to comment on developments.
In particular, in the case of works or actions affecting specific memorials, 
including significant repairs and maintenance, care should be taken to 
consult associated stakeholders, and possibly by including temporary site 
signage to explain what is to happen and providing a contact for more 
information.

Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
Commentary:  Stakeholders might include the Canberra and broader 
community who value the Parade and its components (see the statement 
of significance at Section 7.1).  To some extent, consultation mechanisms 
under the NCA’s works approval process or the EPBC Act may provide 
mechanisms for such consultation.  However, given public interest in and 
sensitivity about developments in or adjacent to the place, an earlier, 
more proactive and iterative mechanism would seem warranted.
11.3 To the extent proposed interpretation relies on information from 
stakeholders, such stakeholders will be consulted about the interpretation 
at a draft stage.
11.4 If Indigenous heritage values or cultural traditions are identified in the 
future in the place, then the NCA will develop appropriate policies and 
protocols to ensure Indigenous people participate in the management 
process for it.
Commentary:  There are currently no Indigenous heritage values or 
cultural traditions identified in the National Heritage listing for the place.
11.5 The NCA will undertake early and proactive consultation regarding the 
management and development of adjacent lands to protect the values of 
Anzac Parade, in particular including with the Australian War Memorial.
Significant Associations
Policy 12
Retaining significant associations
The NCA will respect and foster the retention of significant associations 
between the armed services community and Anzac Parade, and with its 
individual memorials.  This includes the sense of custodianship felt by this 
community.
It should be noted these associations may continue to evolve and change over 
time.
Commentary:  These associations are described in the statement of significance 
(Section 7.1).  See also Policies 6, 8, 11 and 34.

Landscape
The policies in this section apply to the landscape of the Parade, including the designed 
landscapes for specific memorials.  Policies relating to the surrounding landscape are 
provided in the section below on the setting.  Refer also to the policy section on new 
development.
Policy 13
Conservation of the landscape
The overall Anzac Parade landscape character will be conserved.
General qualities of the Parade to be conserved, related to the significant 
broader landscape, include:
•
the underlying geometry and symmetry of the Land Axis, reinforced by 
the plantings, memorials, hard landscaping and road system;
•
the sweeping vistas along the Land Axis – especially in both directions to 
Old and new Parliament House and the Australian War Memorial.  The 
central part of the Land Axis corridor will be kept spatially open and free 
of structures, trees, visual or other impediments.  The large scale of these 
views will be conserved;  and
•
the character of the treescape.  The general aim will be to maintain tree 
plantings to continue an evergreen framework.
The following specific landscape features of Anzac Parade will also be 
conserved:
•
respect and conserve associations;
•
conserve the general form and character of the Parade;
•
conserve the mass tree planting of eucalypts in rows, to retain the 
character of the tall, dense bank of evergreen native foliage;
•
conserve the use of the crushed red brick paving;
•
conserve the mass shrub beds planted with Hebe species;
•
conserve and continue the use of regularly spaced landscape ‘rooms’ for 
the location of memorials;  and
•
future memorials or changes to existing memorials will be wholly 
contained within the landscape rooms.
The designed landscapes for specific memorials will be conserved.
Commentary
Refer to the boundary definition of the Land Axis corridor in Section 1.1.  The 
zone to be kept open is between the rows of trees either side of Anzac Parade.
The designed landscapes for specific memorials have not been studied as part 
of this heritage management plan.  They should be considered as part of 
detailed planning for each memorial.
Refer to the policies below regarding the built elements of the place.
Implementation Strategies
13.1 Changes to the landscape of existing memorials should be undertaken in 
a planned way consistent with this heritage management plan and a long 
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

uPage 
term approach to individual memorials.  Ad hoc changes should be 
avoided.
Commentary:  The periodic addition over time of commemorative 
plantings at the rear of the Kemal Ataturk Memorial might be an example 
where there is a need for care to ensure consistency with a long term 
approach.  For the future, a planned approach to commemorative 
plantings is needed, and this may constrain or rule out further plantings at 
this or other memorials.
13.2 The NCA will explore options to address the lack of a suitable landscape 
screen behind a number of memorials on the east of the Parade.  Suitable 
options will be implemented.
Commentary:  This impacts the Peacekeeping, Tobruk and Navy 
memorials at least.  The issue with the New Zealand Memorial has 
already been identified, and a solution developed (see Strategies 16.5 and 
32.4).
13.3 The NCA should address the range of issues with landscapes of specific 
memorials.
Commentary:  These issues are:
•
Australian National Korean War Memorial – some dead 
plants/shrubs;
•
New Zealand Memorial – in need of a minor tidy-up, removal of 
some weeds;
•
Australian Service Nurses National Memorial – dead shrubs;
•
Royal Australian Navy Memorial – rear screen plantings patchy/in 
poor condition;  and
•
Kemal Ataturk Memorial – landscape plantings are patchy.
In addition, it is noted that some residents of Reid find the large and 
visible area of concrete of the rear blade of the Australian Vietnam 
Forces National Memorial too stark, and would welcome enhanced 
landscaping to soften the view.
13.4 The NCA should consider whether a masterplan should be developed for 
the Parade in order to address a number of issues identified in this 
heritage management plan (eg. weaknesses in the landscape backdrop for 
some memorials, future memorials, public amenities, parking and 
additional paths).  Such masterplanning should be linked with that for the 
Australian War Memorial given they are, in effect, one landscape and 
venue.
Commentary:  Given there will be a number of anniversaries in 2025, 
this might be a timely deadline for such a masterplan, or ideally, 
completion of the works flowing from a masterplan.

The landscape of the Parade and individual memorials will be well maintained 
to reflect the significance of the place.  Maintenance will be based on a 
maintenance plan that is informed by landscape condition monitoring.
Implementation Strategies
14.1 The NCA will ensure the current maintenance planning for the landscape 
is suitable and consistent with this management plan.
14.2 The NCA will prepare one or several landscape maintenance plans, 
possibly for each area within Anzac Parade, including for the specific 
landscapes of individual memorials where these exist.  These will guide 
all managers and contractors in project delivery and maintenance of the 
landscape.  These must be prepared by a suitably qualified landscape 
architect with an understanding of and experience working within 
heritage landscape requirements.
Commentary:  The issue of whether there is one or more such plans is a 
question of practicality – whether the information can be readily included 
in a single, easy to use plan, or if it is better presented in several plans.  
This may also depend on the number of users for plans (eg. one or 
several contractors).
14.3 Landscape maintenance plans for the individual memorials will be 
supported by the collation of detailed baseline documentation about each 
memorial.  This documentation will be updated as changes occur.
Commentary:  This documentation should include:
•
history, details about the design and materials used;
•
details about changes over time;
•
individual significance of the memorial;
•
detailed drawings including plantings;
•
any detailed condition assessment;  and
•
a good photographic record.
Policy 15
Tree survey, database and management plan
The NCA will continue to maintain a database of trees or, as appropriate, tree 
groups within the place, including trees which are part of individual memorials.  
The database will record those trees removed from the place.
The NCA will consider preparing a tree management plan for the trees within 
the Parade.
Commentary
In reality, the tree management plan may in fact be a version of a landscape 
maintenance plan.  The plan may simply extract relevant information about 
significance and management guidance from this heritage management plan, as 
well as have details of specific actions proposed within a given timeframe – 
ideally a timeframe aligned with this plan.  It may also foreshadow longer term

Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
actions.  Tree surveys may also generate recommendations for specific works 
or actions which could be included.
The NCA is currently developing a tree management policy which will be a 
higher level policy document related to the management of all trees within the 
NCA’s estate.  This should also provide a broad framework for management of 
the plantations.  Any tree management plan should be consistent with the final 
tree management policy.
Policy 16
Tree maintenance and replacement
The NCA will seek to conserve the treescape of the Parade and trees will be 
selectively replaced as necessary.  The design concept for the plantations 
relevant to Anzac Parade will be maintained (ie. offset row plantings).
Trees within the area will be maintained, including periodic tree surgery as 
necessary.
In the case of dead, dying or dangerous trees, those in poor health unlikely to 
recover, or those displaying such poor characteristics as to substantially detract 
from the landscape, such trees will be removed.  Trees will be replaced with 
the same species.  Every effort will be made to use an advanced specimen.
Commentary:
The aim is to continue the ongoing careful management of the trees which has 
been successfully undertaken in recent years, rather than to contemplate 
wholesale replacements.
Trees which are part of the designed landscapes for specific memorials have 
not been specifically studied as part of this plan.  While the general approach 
contained in the above policy is likely to be suitable for such trees, additional 
considerations may be important (eg. special associations).  These 
considerations are best understood through detailed planning for each 
memorial.
Implementation Strategies
16.1 While generally any trees removed will be replaced, in some cases it may 
not be practical to replace trees given competition with other existing 
trees.
16.2 The NCA will seek to undertake tree surgery works as identified in 
relevant tree surveys.
16.3 The NCA will continue to remove all inter-row trees (wildling or 
planted) of 150 mm diameter at breast height (DBH) and less, throughout 
the whole plantation area.  The aim is to re-establish the original planting 
pattern over the longer term.
16.4 The NCA should consider using watering berms and continue to use 
mulching for trees, even though this may involve some minor changes to 
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
the immediate landscape character around trees.  Such techniques may be 
used selectively depending on tree health and the risk of decline.
Commentary:
These actions are intended to better retain rainfall and soil moisture.  
Generally, previous issues with runoff have been addressed with 
composting and mulching of the soil profile under the trees.  None the 
less, some runoff is still apparent.
Ongoing soil composting is required as part of an overall strategy, 
however, should this not have the expected result, then the following two 
options should be considered. The first option would be to look at the 
slopes within the existing plantations and assess the possibility for low 
berms on the existing ground level (such as not to place stress on the 
trees by excavation) to slow and retain water at least in the places it is 
feasible to do so in the plantations.  The second option would be a more 
substantial examination of on-site retention possibly involving re-grading 
if, for example, there is sufficient space to do so.
16.5 The NCA will undertake replacement plantings behind the eastern part of 
the New Zealand Memorial to provide a suitable backdrop for the 
memorial.
Policy 17
Shrubs
The Hebe shrubs are important elements within the Parade, and the NCA will 
maintain them, and replace if dead, dying or in poor health.  If possible, 
advanced specimens will be used.
Shrubs within individual memorials will be maintained, or replaced if dead, 
dying or in poor health.
Commentary:
The NCA has reviewed the performance of the current Hebe plantings, 
determined the cause of their poor performance, and intends to develop a 
replacement strategy and maintenance manual.  Full replacement of the 
plantings is required because of the problems identified.
It would also appear that a more suitable dripper irrigation system is required 
to properly maintain healthy plants in this difficult environment.
Higher levels of regular maintenance must be achieved to ensure good 
performance of the plantings.  Otherwise, it is highly likely that the Hebes will 
need to be replaced every five years or so.
Implementation Strategies
17.1 The NCA should develop and implement a Hebe replacement strategy 
and maintenance manual consistent with this plan.  This strategy should 
involve:
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
•
defining the timeframe, sequence and broad pattern of replanting, 
giving consideration to the short-term visual impacts as well as 
long-term objectives;
•
consideration of using plants no smaller than 200 mm pot size;  and
•
preparation of planting beds to maximise healthy growth.
The strategy should be implemented using expert horticultural advice.
The strategy should be undertaken only after consultation with the range 
of stakeholders, including the Canberra community.
Commentary:  The maintenance manual could be a landscape 
maintenance plan under Policy 14, or part of such a plan.
17.2 The NCA should prepare a planting template to ensure consistent 
planting in all planter beds.
Commentary:
It is important that all beds are planted with the same pattern, and that 
each plant has sufficient soil root space, light, water and fertiliser (good 
horticultural practice) to thrive.
The template could be made of a firm but flexible material such as 
rubber, which can be rolled out on each bed to enable a spray marker to 
set the pattern through a hole in the template.
17.3 The NCA should consider trialling different dripper watering systems to 
best deliver water to all plants within the planter beds.
17.4 The NCA should consider the possibility of pruning the perimeter Hebe 
plants in each bed to a lower height to reconstruct the original design 
intention.
Commentary:  As noted in the landscape history in Section 3.3 above, the 
rectangular planter beds originally contained three sections of higher 
growing Hebe species and were surrounded by a lower growing species.  
This allowed those plants in the middle better access to light and water.  
If a single species is to be used, then differential pruning may be possible 
to achieve the desired effect.
Policy 18
Turf and grass areas
The turf areas will continue to be managed to conserve their contribution to the 
heritage values of the Parade.
The NCA will continue to monitor grass trials with species new to Canberra 
which require less water while remaining wear resistant.
In general, the remnant native grasses within the plantation areas will be 
removed and not replaced (the plantations are to be mulched).  Where grasses 
are part of the designed landscape for specific memorials, this may be 
maintained.
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
Commentary
The irrigated turf provides an important contrast with the red gravel of the 
median.
The overshadowing of the native grasses by mature trees has generally led to 
poor performance by the former.  While the grasses are an aspect of the 
designed landscape with some symbolic resonance, the competition with the 
trees is such that their continued use is problematic.
Policy 19
Irrigation
The NCA will maintain irrigation systems where these currently exist and are 
being used.  The NCA may introduce new irrigation to areas not previously 
irrigated, however if mature trees are present then this will only be undertaken 
with the agreement of an expert arborist after consideration of any adverse 
impact on the mature trees.
Commentary:  Refer to Policy 18 regarding turf areas, and Strategy 17.3 
regarding the Hebe plantings.
Policy 20
Landscape condition monitoring
Monitor the condition of the landscape on an ongoing basis, including the 
landscape of individual memorials.  Monitoring will inform maintenance 
planning.
Implementation Strategies
20.1 The NCA will develop and implement monitoring for the landscape.  
Monitoring will particularly consider:
•
the impact of any dry/drought conditions;  and
•
progress of ageing of trees and shrubs.
20.2 Mechanisms will be put in place to ensure timely reporting by 
maintenance contractors to a coordinating officer with overall 
responsibility for the maintenance of the Parade.

Built Elements
The policies in this section apply to the constructed or built elements within the Parade, 
although not the broad landscape or soft landscape elements.  A separate section above 
deals with these latter elements.  Refer also to the policy section below on new 
development.
Policy 21
Conservation of Memorials
Existing memorials will be conserved, subject to any management planning 
which may be specifically developed for memorials.  (Refer to Policy 40 in the 
case of new memorials.)  Memorials have significant associations with specific 
groups of people, and these associations will need to be documented, 
respected, and the significance understood as part of future management 
planning.
The character of memorials may be changed or supplemented if desired by the 
relevant associated groups and/or communities.  Such change should be 
undertaken with due respect to the individual significance of the particular 
memorial, and otherwise be consistent with this heritage management plan.  
Any changes should be undertaken as part of a planned long-term approach, 
and ad hoc changes should be avoided.
Commentary
There are currently 13 memorials in Anzac Parade which are all approved 
National Memorials under the National Memorials Ordinance 1928.
There may be some value in detailed conservation management planning being 
undertaken for each of the memorials, especially if changes are proposed.  Any 
such changes would require approval under the National Memorials Ordinance 
1928 and the EPBC Act.  Over time, a few of the memorials have been 
changed, such as the RAAF Memorial.
Refer to the landscape policies above regarding individual memorials.
Implementation Strategies
21.1 Specialist materials conservators should continue to be used as needed to 
assist with the conservation of individual memorials.
21.2 The NCA should address the range of issues with built aspects of specific 
memorials.
Commentary:  These issues are: 
•
Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorial – minor damage to 
concrete ramp wall, broken granite paver;
•
Desert Mounted Corps Memorial – cracked, loose and missing 
slate pavers, rear drain blocked with leaf litter;
•
Boer War Memorial – minor cracking to the concrete paving;
•
New Zealand Memorial – recessed light pits cleaned out;  and
•
Australian Service Nurses National Memorial – pavement heaving, 
trip hazards, joint sealant deteriorated.

In the case of the Royal Australian Navy Memorial, there is an issue with 
undertaking maintenance and repair in the enclosed and confined pump 
room.  It seems possible that the pump equipment could be relocated into 
a small above-ground enclosure or new sub-surface pit enclosure with a 
large openable lid, sensitively located in the surrounds of the memorial.  
The quality of the finish of any new facility should be carefully 
considered, especially if it is above-ground.
Policy 22
Minor structural features
The NCA will conserve the minor structural features in Anzac Parade that 
contribute to the overall heritage values of the place.
Commentary: Such features include the raised planter bed walls in the median, 
and other retaining walls.
Policy 23
Paths and paving
The red crushed brick gravel paved median will be conserved, and this should 
be consistent with the treatment of the Australian War Memorial’s parade 
ground.
Other paths and paved areas may generally be conserved or upgraded if 
desired.  However, care will be taken if paths are widened or extended to 
maintain the balance of soft and hard landscaping (see Policy 45 regarding new 
paths or paving).  In addition, careful consideration will be given to the palette 
of finishes for paths and paving including:
•
the desirability of a consistent approach throughout Anzac Parade;
•
a sympathetic selection given the character of the landscaping in the 
vicinity of the paths or paving;  and
•
any hierarchy of paths.
Policy 24
Roads
Generally, conserve the form and character of roads within the study area, 
including any upgrading of the road pavement that may be needed.
Every effort will be made to minimise the number of traffic lights in the 
Parade.
Implementation Strategies
24.1 The NCA should explore options to change the kerbing or ways to 
overcome the access barrier for commemorative activities presented by 
the kerbing.
Commentary:  Stakeholders have expressed an interest in possibly 
changing the kerbing to overcome the barrier presented to access.
Policy 25
Car and bus parking
Drop-off and short term parking along Anzac Parade may continue, but 
medium and long term parking will not be permitted.

25.1 All major events will have a traffic management/carparking plan 
including consideration of:
•
the need for barriers to protect fragile areas;
•
the need for on-ground traffic wardens;  and
•
overflow arrangements.
Commentary:  As part of managing events in Canberra, the NCA has 
defined the range of possible events, including major events.
‘A major event is an organised gathering involving a significant number of people 
(generally more than 5,000) that requires a specific venue and has significant associated 
structures and involves changes to normal traffic and parking conditions.  Major events 
may require exclusive access to a venue and other facilities for a number of days.’  
(NCA 2003, p. 12)
 
25.2 Temporary parking on grass areas or in the plantations will not be 
permitted.
25.3 The NCA should consider masterplanning for future car and bus access 
and parking related to the Parade.
Policy 26
Signs and furniture
Existing signs and furniture may be maintained or removed.  (Refer to Policies 
43 and 44 in the case of new signs and furniture.)
Implementation Strategies
26.1 The existing seating should be reviewed to confirm it is of a suitable 
height.  If necessary, this may be adapted to achieve a suitable height.
Commentary:  Some of the seats integrated with concrete walls appear to 
be very high off the ground, and unsuitable for many users.
Policy 27
Street lighting
The specially designed street lighting in Anzac Parade will be conserved.  
(Refer to Policy 46 regarding new lighting.)
Policy 28
Infrastructure
Generally maintain existing infrastructure, such as services, unless they fail to 
meet current or projected needs or standards.  Infrastructure may be upgraded 
or adapted but this should involve no increase in impact.  (Refer to Policy 47 in 
the case of new infrastructure.)
Policy 29
Maintenance planning and works
Anzac Parade will be well maintained and all maintenance and repair work 
should respect the significance of the place.  Maintenance and repair will be 
based on a maintenance plan that is informed by:
•
a sound knowledge of each part of the place and its heritage significance;  
and
•
regular inspection/monitoring.

It will also include provision for timely preventive maintenance and prompt 
repair in the event of damage or breakdown.
Commentary:
Some stakeholders have noted the occasional difference between the well-
maintained grounds of the Australian War Memorial, and the standard of 
maintenance achieved in the Parade.  Ideally, both would be maintained to the 
same standard.
See also Strategies 13.3 and 21.1 regarding works to memorials.
Implementation Strategies
29.1 The NCA will review existing maintenance planning to ensure 
consistency with this management plan.
29.2 The NCA will ensure maintenance planning is periodically informed by a 
monitoring program (refer to Policy 31).
29.3 The NCA will consider developing a life-cycle maintenance plan for the 
place, and this should complement the suite of maintenance planning.
Policy 30
Upgrading and adaptation works
The NCA will replace or upgrade fabric and services, or undertake adaptation 
works as required by their condition or changed standards.  Such works will 
not compromise significance unless there is no alternative, in which case every 
effort will be made to minimise the impact on significance.
Commentary:  Adaptation in this plan involves no, or minimal impact on 
significance, in accordance with the Burra Charter (Australia ICOMOS 2013).
Policy 31
Condition monitoring
The condition of fabric will be monitored on a periodic basis.  This will be 
distinct from maintenance but should be linked to it for implementation.  The 
information gained will identify components experiencing deterioration, which 
should in turn inform maintenance planning.
Implementation Strategies
31.1 The NCA will develop and implement monitoring to identify changes in 
the condition of the place.  Priority will be given to components in high 
use or vulnerability.
31.2 Mechanisms will be put in place to ensure timely reporting by 
maintenance contractors to a coordinating officer with overall 
responsibility for the maintenance of the Parade.

Setting
The policies in this section apply to the area around Anzac Parade, including along the 
Land Axis.
Policy 32
Protection of the Setting
The NCA will protect the setting of Anzac Parade to the extent possible within 
its powers.  Beyond this, the NCA will encourage such protection for those 
areas which fall outside its responsibilities.
The NCA will protect the forested character of Mount Ainslie, and will protect 
or encourage protection of views to the hills from within Anzac Parade.
Implementation Strategies
32.1 The NCA will liaise with the ACT Government to encourage protection 
of any part of the setting within the control of the ACT Government.
32.2 The NCA will take particular care to ensure the protection of the forested 
character of Mount Ainslie, especially in views along the Land Axis.  
Any new development on Mount Ainslie should have, at most, minimal 
visual impact from within the Parade, and be subject to an impact study.
32.3 The NCA will manage the remnant sections of plantations in front of the 
sites of the former Anzac Park East and current Anzac Park West 
Buildings (the Portal Buildings) within that part of the verge it manages, 
consistent with the management of the other plantations in Anzac Parade.
The NCA will also liaise with the Department of Finance and/or the 
building owners about management of the remaining areas and 
plantations in front of the Portal Building sites, consistent with the other 
plantations along the Parade.
Commentary:  All of the plantations along Anzac Parade should be 
managed in a consistent manner.  For example, when tree replacement 
for the major part of the Parade is undertaken, this should also include 
the trees in front of the Portal Building sites.
32.4 The NCA will ensure implementation of the landscape screening 
measures for developments east of the Parade on Constitution Avenue, as 
indicated in the National Capital Plan.
32.5 The NCA should seek to preserve the symmetrical portal effect of the 
former Anzac Park East and current Anzac Park West buildings.
Policy 33
Protection of views to and from the Parade
The significant views to and from the Parade will be protected.  The significant 
views include:
•
to and from the Australian War Memorial;
•
to the surrounding hills, especially Mount Ainslie;
•
to the Parliamentary Zone;  and
•
from Mount Ainslie and Parliament House.

Notes
The uses listed in this table are provided to supplement the formal land use definitions provided in the 
National Capital Plan.
Commentary:  It should be noted commemorative activities may change over 
time in response to the perceptions, needs and aspirations of associated 
individuals, groups and communities.  This change should be accommodated.
Implementation Strategies
34.1 The NCA should continue to support commemorative activities in Anzac 
Parade.
34.2 The NCA should foster discussions about financial and other support for 
commemorative activities, where needed.
Commentary:  Such discussions should include the Australian War 
Memorial and the associated communities.
34.3 The NCA will continue to ensure, as far as possible, that mechanisms are 
in place to coordinate uses in the case of major events.
Policy 35
New and continuing uses compatible with significance
Any continuing use or new use proposed for the Parade will be compatible 
with the significance of the place, and should ideally be complimentary to the 
primary uses.
Policy 36
Access
The NCA will promote ready public access to the Parade.  Temporary 
restrictions including security measures may apply to parts of the area related 
to particular events (eg. Anzac Day commemorative events).
There may be occasions when groups with particular associations to a

New development
Policy 37
General provisions relating to new development
The following general provisions will be implemented:
•
new permanent developments will not impact on the heritage values of 
the Parade;
•
new permanent development in the area will be part of a planned 
approach which is in keeping with the values of the Parade.  Ad hoc 
development will be avoided;
•
developments will generally maintain public access to parklands and 
open spaces, and will not close off spaces;
•
new structures will be well below the mature tree canopy in the Parade;
•
permanent structural or building intrusions to the Land Axis will not be 
permitted, apart from new memorials located in existing memorial 
locations;
•
permanent intrusions which block or substantially intrude into significant 
views/vistas will not be permitted – proposals should carefully consider 
any visual impact;  and
•
consideration will be given to the impacts of new development on the 
values attributed to the Parade and its components by specific and 
broader associated communities, groups associated with specific sites 
(eg. memorials), and other users and visitors to the Parade.  This will 
include consideration of construction-phase impacts.
Policy 38
New landscaping, landscape structures and plantings
New landscaping, landscape structures and plantings, not including 
replacement plantings, may be permitted subject to the following:
•
that it is associated with a memorial and is contained within the 
landscape room;
•
that it is consistent with the general landscape conservation provisions 
(see Policy 13) and is broadly sympathetic to the character of the Parade;
•
that it respects the existing tree planting pattern of the plantations;  and
•
that it is consistent with any management plan which may exist for the 
specific component affected.
Proposals for new landscaping associated with memorials should be 
encouraged to use native grasses.
Commentary:  Such landscaping may be related to a new memorial or to the re-
design of the landscape of an existing memorial.
Policy 39
New buildings or structures
In general, new buildings or structures will not be permitted unless part of a 
proposed memorial.
The exception is the possible provision of new toilet facilities within the Anzac 
Parade area.  Such facilities will be of a high quality design and materials 
consistent with the Parade, be single storey, as small as possible and be 
unobtrusive (eg. finished in muted colours) from within the central section of 
the Parade.  Such facilities may only be sited towards the outer edges of the 
boundaries of the place and at the northeast end where the area of landscape

and trees is wider.
Commentary:  See Policy 38 regarding landscape structures.  There is a need 
for public amenities in the Parade area for those attending commemorative 
events, and for other visitors (eg. toilets, water points), although there are no 
current proposals.
Implementation Strategies
39.1 The NCA should explore the possibility of enhanced public amenities 
within the Parade.  Ideally, this should be undertaken with the Australian 
War Memorial, with such amenities being considered as part of 
masterplanning for both the Parade and AWM as one venue.
Policy 40
New memorials
New memorials may be installed in the existing vacant landscape rooms.
Planning should be undertaken to anticipate the possibility of future additional 
memorials beyond the current capacity of Anzac Parade.
Memorials should be contained within the landscape rooms, and should not 
extend beyond, including beyond the footpath line.
Commentary
Two memorial locations remain unallocated.
As noted above, proposals for landscaping associated with new memorials 
should be encouraged to use native grasses.
With regard to future additional memorials beyond the current capacity:
•
this may require consideration of potential sites outside of Anzac Parade;
•
this should involve consultations with the Australian War Memorial, 
armed services community and probably other stakeholders as well;
•
including more memorial locations within Anzac Parade, similar to the 
existing, is not desirable in terms of the design values of the place, 
although some stakeholders may be in favour.  However, other forms of 
memorials, or smaller memorials may be possible.  It may also be 
possible to consider reserving the two remaining vacant memorial niches 
to house many smaller memorials rather than just large single memorials;  
and
•
the park/plantation areas in front of Anzac Park East and West facing the 
Parade may be considered suitable locations, however, this will conflict 
with the sense of the New Zealand Memorial being the formal start of the 
memorial parade.
Policy 41
New parking
No new surface or above ground parking will be permitted within Anzac 
Parade.

Policy 42
Temporary changes
Temporary changes of short duration may be permitted subject to the range of 
policies in this plan, in particular Policy 36 regarding access.  (See also 
Strategy 25.2 regarding temporary parking.)
Temporary tent/shelter structures for commemorative events may be permitted 
subject to the following:
•
there is a strong demonstrated need for such a structure, rather than it 
simply being a desired amenity;
•
the size of the structure is kept to the minimum possible;
•
the tent/shade material is a neutral colour with no advertising, signage or 
logos;
•
the duration of the structure is as short as possible, and in principle no 
longer than three days;  and
•
if the structure is located on the median, then it should be as close to the 
road edge as possible.
Policy 43
Signage
New signage may be permitted provided that:
•
every effort is made to provide good quality signage, consistent with the 
overall area;
•
signs will be carefully sited, especially in the case of signs in major 
vistas;
•
every effort will be made to avoid having signs or to minimise the 
number of signs;  and
•
no large signs will be permitted in Anzac Parade.
Commentary:  In this policy, signs include freestanding and attached signs, as 
well as banners and flags.  The policy also relates to temporary and permanent 
signs.
Policy 44
Furniture
New street or park furniture may be permitted provided that:
•
every effort is made to provide good quality furniture, consistent for the 
overall area;
•
furniture will be carefully sited and grouped, especially in the case of 
furniture in major vistas;  and
•
furniture will generally be sited to the sides of the Land Axis corridor.
Policy 45
Paths and paving
Limited new paths and paving may be permitted provided that:
•
every effort is made to provide good quality paths or paving, consistent 
with the overall area;
•
it is carefully sited, especially in the case of major vistas;
•
it pays careful regard to and is sympathetic with the geometry of the 
Parade;
•
it responds to a substantial demonstrated need or requirement;  and
•
it is consistent with the guidance provided in Policy 23.
Ideally, new paths would be undertaken as part of an overall masterplanning 
exercise for the Parade, rather than as an ad hoc response.

Policy 46
Lighting
Limited new lighting may be permitted provided that:
•
it is part of a memorial design;
•
it does not detract from the street lighting;
•
every effort is made to provide good quality lighting, consistent with the 
overall area;
•
it is carefully sited, especially in the case of major vistas;
•
it responds to a substantial demonstrated need or requirement;  and
•
it is consistent with the guidance provided in Policy 27.

memorials along the Parade.  Individual memorials should not be lit too 
brightly compared to other memorials, or use coloured lighting in a way that 
creates a jarring contrast with existing memorials.
Policy 47
Infrastructure
Limited new infrastructure may be permitted provided that:
•
where possible, such infrastructure is included as part of existing or new 
memorials;
•
every effort is made to provide good quality publicly visible finishes for 
infrastructure, consistent with the overall area;
•
it is carefully sited, especially in the case of major vistas;  and
•
it responds to a substantial demonstrated need or requirement.

Interpretation
Policy 48
Interpreting the significance of Anzac Parade
The significance of the place will be interpreted to the range of visitors who 
use the Parade, and to NCA staff responsible for the place in any way.  This 
interpretation will include reference to the broader setting.
Implementation Strategies
48.1 The NCA will develop and implement a simple interpretive strategy 
considering the range of possible messages, audiences and 
communication techniques.  The interpretation will focus on the heritage 
values of the place, and this will include the specific memorials.
Audiences will include the local Canberra community, visitors, school 
children, as well as Australians living in other parts of the country.
Commentary:  Substantial interpretation is already provided such as 
through guided and self-guided walking tours, and the NCA’s website.  
Other options might include:
•
using members of the armed services community in interpretive 
activities;
•
greater use of oral histories to provide stories linking individuals 
with the larger national stories, or to tell stories not obvious in the 
Parade;  and
•
improved interpretation panels within and outside the Parade, 
subject to careful design and siting, such as at the major viewing 
points inside and outside the area.
Coordination with the Australian War Memorial is also highly desirable, 
including the possibility of better sharing interpretation of the Parade.
Refer to Strategy 11.3 regarding consultation with stakeholders about 
interpretation.
48.2 The interpretive strategy will be periodically reviewed as part of the 
review of this management plan (see Policy 9).
Policy 49
Signage
Appropriate, consistent and good quality directional, interpretive and 
information signage will be provided.
Commentary:  See Policy 43 regarding new signage.
Implementation Strategies
49.1 Existing or proposed signage will be reviewed to ensure consistency with 
this policy and also in the light of the interpretive strategy (Strategy 
48.1).

Unforeseen Discoveries
Policy 50
Unforeseen discoveries or disturbance of heritage components
If the unforeseen discovery of new evidence or the unforeseen disturbance of 
heritage fabric or values requires major management or conservation decisions 
not envisaged by this heritage management plan, the plan will be reviewed and 
revised (see Policy 9).
If management action is required before the management plan can be revised, a 
heritage impact statement will be prepared that:
•
assesses the likely impact of the proposed management action on the 
existing assessed significance of the place;
•
assesses the impact on any additional significance revealed by the new 
discovery;
•
considers feasible and prudent alternatives;  and
•
if there are no such alternatives, then considers ways to minimise the 
impact.
If action is required before a heritage impact statement can be developed, the 
NCA will seek relevant expert heritage advice before taking urgent action.
Urgent management actions shall not diminish the significance of the place 
unless there is no feasible and prudent alternative.
Commentary
Unforeseen discoveries may be related to location of new documentary or 
physical evidence about the place or specific heritage values that are not 
known at the time of this report, and that might impact on the management and 
conservation of the place.  Discovery of new heritage values, or the discovery 
of evidence casting doubt on existing assessed significance, would be 
examples.
Discovery of potential threats to heritage values may also not be adequately 
canvassed in the existing policies.  Potential threats might include the need to 
upgrade services or other operational infrastructure to meet current standards, 
the discovery of hazardous substances that require removal, or the physical 
deterioration of fabric.
Unforeseen disturbance might be related to accidental damage to fabric, or 
disastrous events such as fire or flood.
Such actions may be referable matters under the EPBC Act.

Keeping Records
Policy 51
Records of intervention and maintenance
The NCA will maintain records related to any substantial intervention or 
change in the place, including records about maintenance.
Commentary:  Refer to the NCA’s Heritage Strategy and heritage register 
regarding provisions about records.
Implementation strategies
51.1 The NCA will retain records relating to actions taken in accordance with 
Policy 8 – Decision making process for works or actions.
51.2 The NCA will retain copies of all maintenance plans prepared for the 
place, including superseded plans, and records about monitoring.  (Refer 
to Policies 14, 20, 29 and 31)
51.3 A summary of substantial interventions, changes and maintenance will be 
included in the NCA heritage register entry for the place, including a 
reference to where further details may be found.
Policy 52
Sensitive information
The NCA will develop protocols for the management of sensitive information, 
should any such information emerge.
Commentary:  At the current time there is no known sensitive information, 
beyond normal government and commercial information, which is already 
subject to standard protection procedures.
Further Research
Policy 53
Research to address the limitations of this management plan
Opportunities to undertake research to address the limitations imposed on this 
plan (see Section 1.4) should be taken if possible, and the results used to revise 
the management plan.

9.5 IMPLEMENTATION PLAN
Responsibility for Implementation
The person with overall responsibility for implementing this management plan is the 
person holding the position of Chief Executive, National Capital Authority.
Commitment to Best Practice
The NCA is committed to achieving best practice in heritage conservation, in accordance 
with its legislative responsibilities and Government policy, and in the context of its other 
specific and general obligations and responsibilities.  This is reflected in the preparation of 
this management plan and in the adoption of:
•
Policy 1 – Significance the basis for management, planning and work;
•
Policy 2 – Adoption of Burra Charter;  and
•
Policy 7 – Expert heritage conservation advice.
Works Program
Refer to Strategy 3.1 and Table 10 in the preceding section.
Criteria for Prioritising Work
See Strategy 8.3.
Resolving Conflicting Objectives
See Strategy 8.4.
Annual Review
Refer to Strategy 8.5.
Resources for Implementation
It is difficult to be precise about the budget for maintenance of Anzac Parade because 
funding details are not kept for just the study area.  Accordingly, it is not currently possible 
to isolate the maintenance budget for just this area.  In addition, the future budgetary 
situation of the NCA is uncertain.
None the less, funding has been provided in previous years in a range of categories 
relevant to the Parade, including:
•
maintenance of civil infrastructure on National Land;
•
Anzac Parade/Australian War Memorial open space maintenance;
•
irrigation water;  and
•
memorials, fountains and artworks.
As noted in Section 8.4, the NCA has staff who undertake management of the maintenance 
contracts, interpretation planning, new works planning, events management, and the NCA 
otherwise uses contractors to undertake actual maintenance.  These staff and contractors 
will, to some extent, be involved in implementing aspects of this plan.

Summary Statement of Significance
The Australian War Memorial (AWM) is Australia's national shrine to those Australians who lost their 
lives and suffered as a result of war.  As such it is important to the Australian community as a whole and 
has special associations with veterans and their families including the Returned & Services League of 
Australia.  These special associations are reinforced on ANZAC Day and at ceremonies specific to 
particular memorials on Anzac Parade.
 The AWM in its setting was a direct consequence of the First World War, one of the seminal events in 
Australian history.  Official war correspondent, Charles Bean, believed that the war would have a strong 
influence on the creation of a sense of nationhood and a distinctly Australian character and identity.  
Bean’s vision of a war memorial as a place to house the objects made sacred by their direct association 
with the events and sacrifice of Australians at war was embodied in the establishment of the AWM.  A 
purpose built repository, the AWM is a place where the nature of commemoration was based on an integral 
relationship between the building, commemorative spaces and the collections of objects and records.  This 
is rare in Australia and uncommon in the world.  The AWM has a unique and important function in 
collecting and displaying objects and records of Australians’ experience of war.  It has the potential to 
yield information that will contribute to Australia’s social, political and military history.
 The role of the AWM with its central location in the nation’s capital is an important landmark in Australia 
and a popular national icon.  Although the AWM was not part of the original design for Canberra, Walter 
Burley Griffin agreed that it would be a fitting structure for its prominent position.  The surrounding 
landscape design, indigenous and exotic plantings and setting and sympathetic location of associated 
structures and the symmetry of land axis have maintained the importance of the views of the AWM and its 
dominance in the landscape.  As the terminating building at the northern end of the land axis of Griffin's 
plan for Canberra, the AWM makes a major contribution to the principal views from both Parliament 
Houses and from Mount Ainslie.  Major features of the original site include: the main building; the 
external fabric; the ceremonial landscape including indigenous and exotic plantings immediately in front 
of the main building; the Lone Pine tree; and displays and sculptures.  The Hall of Memory with the Tomb 
of the Unknown Australian Soldier and in conjunction with aspects of its setting, demonstrates changing 
and evolving concepts of commemoration.  The courtyard and its honour colonnade, the reflection pool 
and plantings contribute to its outstanding significance.
 The AWM in its setting is of outstanding importance for its aesthetic characteristics.  The place is highly 
valued for its great beauty by the Australian community and veteran groups.  The main building and the 
surrounding landscape, the Hall of Memory, the Roll of Honour, ANZAC Hall and the collections act as 
reminders of important events and people in Australia's history.  The AWM triggers disturbing and 
poignant responses from the vast majority of visitors and has also inspired artistic works such as paintings 
and photographs.
 The AWM and Anzac Parade have special associations with Australia’s military forces and with veterans 
as represented by the Returned & Services League of Australia and community groups.  Anzac Parade was 
opened on ANZAC Day 1965, the fiftieth anniversary of the landing of the ANZAC's at Gallipoli.  It is the 
setting for a series of memorials commemorating Australian service and sacrifice in war and is the major 
national venue for the ANZAC Day march and other ceremonies to commemorate those who served 
Australia in times of conflict.  Anzac Parade, as part of the Parliamentary Vista and as an extension of the 
AWM, has a deep symbolism for many Australians, and has become part of one of the major cultural 
landscapes of Australia.  The notion of a ceremonial space of this grandeur is not found elsewhere in 
Australia and Anzac Parade is nationally important for its public and commemorative functions.  The 
memorials along Anzac Parade also demonstrate changing and evolving concepts of commemoration,

under the influence of veteran, community and migrant groups and the armed forces.  The AWM has 
special associations with Charles Bean, John Treloar and Sir Henry Gullett who contributed to building the 
national identity through their work.
Official Values
Criterion A Events, Processes
The AWM is an outstanding national museum and memorial, as expressed through the main building, the 
courtyard fabric, interior spaces, the Sculpture Garden and the collections.  The AWM was established as a 
direct consequence of the First World War, one of the seminal events in Australian history.  It embodied the 
vision of Charles Bean – Official First World War correspondent – that the war would be instrumental in 
creating a sense of nationhood and a distinctly Australian identity.  The institution plays a pivotal role in 
helping Australians to commemorate and understand the sacrifice and loss of Australians during war.
The AWM together with Anzac Parade is an important national icon.  Its major features include: the main 
building; the medieval stone lions at the entrance; the ceremonial landscape including the Lone Pine tree; and
displays and sculptures.  The AWM and Anzac Parade are major venues for national commemorative service
and events such as the ANZAC Day march.
Anzac Parade, as part of the Parliamentary Vista and an extension of the AWM, is part of one of the major 
designed landscapes of Australia.  A ceremonial space of this grandeur is unique in Australia.
The AWM and the memorials along Anzac Parade represent changing concepts of commemoration in 
Australia, influenced by the armed forces and community groups.  The Hall of Memory with the Tomb of the
Unknown Australian Soldier, and aspects of its setting are notable.
Criterion B Rarity
The AWM building is a purpose built repository, reflecting the integral relationship between the building, 
commemorative spaces and the collections.  This is unique in Australia and rare elsewhere in the world.  The
values are expressed in the fabric of the main building, the entrance, the Hall of Memory, the collections and
the surrounding landscape.
The AWM collection contains unique objects including a Lancaster bomber and the largest collection of 
Victoria Crosses in the world.  The building contains rare elements, notably the medieval stone lions at the 
entrance and the Hall of Memory with its largest mosaics in the world.
Anzac Parade, as part of the Parliamentary Vista and as an extension of the AWM, is part of one of the major
cultural landscapes of Australia.  The grandeur of the ceremonial space is not found elsewhere in Australia.  
Anzac Parade is nationally important for its public and commemorative functions.
Criterion C Research
The AWM has a unique and important function in the nation in collecting and displaying objects and records
on Australians’ experience of war.  The AWM and other institutions have used these materials to produce 
research on social, political and military history.  The place has the potential to yield further substantial 
information on Australians’ experience of war.  These values are expressed through the collections.
Criterion E Aesthetic characteristics
The AWM in its setting is of outstanding importance for its aesthetic characteristics, valued as a place of 
great beauty by the Australian community and veteran groups (as represented by the Returned & Services 
League of Australia).  The place has evoked strong emotional and artistic responses from Australian and 
overseas visitors.  The main building and the surrounding landscape, the Hall of Memory, the Roll of Honour
ANZAC Hall and the collections act as reminders of important events and people in Australia's history and 
trigger disturbing and poignant responses from the vast majority of visitors.
The AWM together with Anzac Parade form an important national landmark that is highly valued by the 
Australian community.  As part of the Parliamentary Vista, the AWM makes a major contribution to the 
principal views from both Parliament Houses and Mount Ainslie.  Views from Anzac Parade to the Hall of 
Memory, and from the Hall of Memory along the land axis are outstanding.  Its prominent position is 
important due to its relative visual isolation on the Griffin land axis, amid the backdrop of the forested slopes
of Mount Ainslie.  The visual impact of the AWM when viewed from Parliament House and other points 
along Griffin's land axis including Mount Ainslie; and the fabric of Anzac Parade including the memorials, 
plantings and lighting is far more distinctive and dramatic compared to the other principal war memorials in 
Australia

The AWM building and the Anzac Parade memorials have special associations with Australia’s military 
forces and veterans represented by the Returned & Services League of Australia.
The AWM's success as a shrine, a museum, an architectural form and part of Canberra's urban plan is partly 
the result of its special associations with the lives and works of people who have been significant in 
Australia's history.  These include the AWM’s founders Charles Bean, John Treloar and Sir Henry Gullett.
The values are expressed in the fabric of the place which includes: the main building; the Hall of Memory; 
the collections; the surrounding landscape; and Anzac Parade.
Description
Planning context
Griffin’s plans for the central national area of Canberra included a basic framework which survives to the 
present.  An alignment of land and water axes and avenues defined Griffin's city plan.  The axes together 
with the triangle bounded by Commonwealth Avenue, Constitution Avenue and Kings Avenue were the 
basic elements that established Canberra's geometric design pattern.  The design represented Griffin's 
interpretation of democracy and created three urban centres connected by its main avenues: Capital Hill as 
the place for the people; Mount Vernon as the municipal centre; and Mount Pleasant as the market centre.  
The northern avenue, Constitution Avenue, was the municipal axis.  The AWM is located at the northern 
end of the land axis, the major planning axis that runs from Parliament House, through Federation Mall 
and Parkes Place and along Anzac Parade to Mount Ainslie.  The AWM has an elevated position at the end 
of Anzac Parade and is framed by Mount Ainslie in the background.  It is a powerful form within the axial 
landscape of Canberra (Pearson & Crocket 1995: 42-44; Freeman, 2004: 4).  Australian planners have 
followed Griffin’s vision but with minor changes in terms of impact to reflect historical events and 
Australian political and social life.
Australian War Memorial
The site of the AWM is the area bounded by Limestone Avenue, Fairbairn Avenue and Treloar Crescent.  
The AWM is part of a larger landscape which is structured by Griffin’s land axis and includes Anzac Park, 
Anzac Parade, Remembrance Park on the slopes of Mount Ainslie behind the AWM, Mount Pleasant and 
Black Mountain.  The AWM is closely associated with memorials along Anzac Parade that commemorate 
important aspects of Australia's involvement in war.
The AWM is a unique commemorative institution that functions as a memorial, a museum, an archive and 
a centre for research.  The complex includes commemorative areas, a Sculpture Garden, gallery exhibits, 
research facilities, an administration building and a kiosk.  The major commemorative spaces are the grand 
entrance, the central courtyard and Pool of Remembrance, the flanking cloisters with the Roll of Honour 
and the copper domed Hall of Memory.
The main building is stone faced, designed in the art deco style and has a cruciform plan with two floors of 
galleries, a library, war records storage, office space and workshop facilities.  The building displays 
Byzantine modelling in its interpenetrating forms and the front entrance shows Egyptian influences in its 
pylons and massing.  Important features of the style include: a stepped skyline; concentration of ornament 
on the upper part of the building; a tower feature; and a monumental entrance.  Two medieval stone lions, 
donated by the city of Ypres in 1936, are located in the entrance area.  The lions previously stood at the 
gateway of the Menin road at Ypres and were damaged during the First World War.  The Hall of Memory, 
with its stepped cubic forms and copper dome, is the key architectural and landmark element of the place.  
As the major vertical element in the architectural composition, it closes the view from within the courtyard 
and is a prominent terminating feature of the land axis and Canberra’s landscape setting.  The mosaics and 
stained glass windows within the hall are outstanding pieces of monumental applied art in the art deco 
style.  The Roll of Honour is an important historical monument and visual statement of Australians who 
died in war.  It is a key element of the founding concept for the AWM, even though it was not installed 
until the 1960s.

Hall of Memory
The Hall of Memory is an important symbolic space in the AWM comprising several outstanding pieces.  
It was originally conceived by Sodersteen as containing a roll of honour but funds were not available to 
build a dome that could house all the names.  The design was amended to include the names in a 
commemorative courtyard.  In 1937 the AWM Board agreed to complete the hall by installing a sculpture, 
stained glass windows and mosaics.  Designed by Napier Waller, the windows reflect the First World War 
and the mosaics on the dome pendentives represent the four arms of the services, including women's 
services.  The mosaic inside the dome depicts the souls of the dead rising from the earth towards their 
spiritual home, represented by a glowing sun within the Southern Cross.  The figures on the walls – a 
soldier, a sailor, an airman and a servicewoman – recall the Australian experience of the Second World 
War.  Over six million pieces of glass tesserae, or tiles, imported from Italy, were used in the composition; 
the installation was overseen by Italian craftsmen and took three years to complete.  Leslie Bowles was 
commissioned for the sculpture but his designs were all rejected before he passed away.  Ray Ewers later 
produced a statue of a young soldier which was installed in 1955.  The statue was removed and relocated 
in the Sculpture Garden in 1993 to accommodate the new Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier.  Four 
pillars behind the tomb, designed by Janet Laurence, represent the ancient elements of earth, air, fire and 
water, symbolising the variety of terrain and climate where Australians served and died.  The hall has since 
functioned as a mausoleum, as a quiet place for contemplation of the efforts of ordinary Australians in war 
and remembrance of those who suffered and died (Pearson & Crocket 1995: 19-24).
Courtyard and Roll of Honour
The courtyard with its cloisters, Roll of Honour and Pool of Reflection evolved from Crust's design 
collaboration with Sodersteen.  A stepped granite cascade designed by Robert Woodward was added at the 
northern end of the pool in 1980 and this was replaced in 1988 by an eternal flame.  At the southern end of 
the pool is the Inauguration Stone and the courtyard is flanked with twenty-six carved sandstone gargoyles 
designed by Bowles.  The Roll of Honour was completed in 1967 and contains the names of over 120,000 
Australians killed in war, from the Sudan in 1855 to the Vietnam War in the 1970s.  A Commemorative 
Book was established in 1975 to list Australians who died as a result of any war.  Between 1979 and 1988 
the names of theatres of war were inscribed in bronze letters on the courtyard walls.  Rosemary and Pencil 
Pines used in the courtyard are symbolically associated with remembrance and sacrifice (Pearson & 
Crocket 1995: 24-27).
Galleries and collections
A series of galleries and displays exhibit artefacts related to Australia's involvement in war and form a 
major component of the AWM.  The galleries are an integral aspect of the AWM’s commemorative and 
museum functions to remember and increase an understanding of Australians’ involvement in war.  This 
includes outstanding dioramas and picture models dating from 1920 through to 1983.  Several dioramas 
(four large, six small and two very small series) constructed prior to the opening of the AWM have 
survived with modifications.  The building initially made extensive use of skylights for galleries and 
diorama displays but these were modified after conservation problems arose.  In 1968-71 major alterations 
included the extension of the transept wings which provided additional gallery space and the closing of 
skylights in favour of artificial lighting.  Most of the galleries have been altered significantly since their 
construction.  The Sinai Palestine Gallery, in situ since 1941, is largely intact, including the original ceiling 
pattern and rubber tile flooring (Pearson & Crocket 1995: 25-27).  Internal alterations in 1996-97 retained 
the Sinai Palestine Gallery.
The AWM houses an extensive and unique collection of artefacts and records on Australians’ experience 
of war.  These comprise: films, photographs and sound recordings (including unedited material taken by 
official cameramen and private individuals, commercial documentaries, oral histories, radio interviews, 
period music); printed and ephemeral materials (such as official records, diaries, postcards); military 
heraldry; tens of thousands military technology objects; dioramas and other models; and artworks 
including those that originated in the official war art schemes.  The AWM has the nation’s largest archive 
of the writings of ordinary Australians on their experience of war (AWM web site).  The First World War 
dioramas are significant icons as: rare surviving examples of artist created three dimensional display 
models; documents that were specifically created to record historical events; and highly creative 
interpretive devices.  The Battle of Romani, the last large diorama, and the Transport diorama series are in 
their original location in the Sinai Gallery.
ANZAC Hall
ANZAC Hall was built as a modern, flexible exhibition hall of 3,000 square metres to display the AWM's 
collection of large technology objects.  The design of a high curved wall of aerodynamic plan form some 
20 metres behind the main building provided space and retained the view of the original building ‘in the

round’, as originally intended by Sodersteen and Crust.  The hall sits unobtrusively behind the iconic main 
building.  The fan shaped bulk of the building was excavated in the hillside, so that it would have the 
minimum impact on views from Anzac Parade, with a large curved metal roof fanning out from the centre 
point of a dome behind the wall.  A simple steel/glass bridge link joins the existing building to the new 
hall.  The stone, concrete, metal and glass of the new hall enable the new forms to ‘meld’ appropriately 
with the heritage values of the main building and its landscape setting.  In 2005, ANZAC Hall received the 
RAIA’s Sir Zelman Cowen Award for public buildings for its design excellence (Architecture Australia 
2005: 56-61).
C E W Bean Building
The building, designed by Denton Corker Marshall Architects, was completed in March 2006.  The design, 
the location and external finishes are compatible with other AWM buildings.  The building comprises a 
simple masonry flat roofed block embedded into the landscape behind a stone embankment.  It is situated 
to the east of the AWM and is connected to it by an underground tunnel.  Due to the topography, most of 
the lower storey is below ground level.  The building's parapet height aligns with the main mid level 
parapet of the AWM building.  It is set back nine metres from the existing road kerb adjacent to the stone 
embankment.  The building houses paper based collections, facilities for the photographic laboratories, a 
workshop and staff.  The tunnel allows for the safe movement of collections.
Landscape setting
The open landscape surrounding the main building and the natural landscape of the Mount Ainslie 
backdrop are important features of the complex.  Eucalypts and wattles are planted to the east of the 
building, giving an appearance of an extension of the natural vegetation of Mount Ainslie as proposed in 
the 1952 plans.  To the west of the building are mixed exotic plantings of deciduous and coniferous trees 
including the Lone Pine (Ratcliffe 1993).  The Lone Pine tree was planted by the Duke of Gloucester in 
1934 in memory of all sons who died in the Lone Pine attack in Gallipoli (1915).  An Australian soldier 
who took part in the campaign in which his brother was killed, collected seed from one of the branches of 
an Aleppo pine used by the Turks as overhead cover for their trenches.  His mother raised a tree from the 
seed and presented it to the AWM (Pearson & Crocket 1995: 44).
The ceremonial landscape immediately in front of the main building takes the form of an amphitheatre 
with central steps leading up to the AWM.  There are paved and grassed terraces each side of the steps and 
the focus of the amphitheatre is the Stone of Remembrance.  Remembrance Park contains two Victoria 
Cross memorials and a commemorative plaque marking the end of the Remembrance driveway (2002) that 
links Canberra to Sydney.  Five trees that commemorate various branches of the armed forces were 
originally planted along the western side of the AWM but have since been relocated to enhance the visual 
interpretation of the main building.  A Sculpture Garden, located to the west of the main building,  features 
Sir Bertram Mackennal’s famous 1906 War sculpture portraying Bellona, the Roman goddess of war, and 
the Merchant Seamen Roll of Honour on either side of the sculpture.  Other commemorative works include 
memorial plaques and memorials to the British Commonwealth Occupation Force and to Australian 
servicewomen and important sculptures such as Simpson and his donkey, Australian serviceman, and Sir 
Edward "Weary" Dunlop.  Further memorials are expected to be located in the area.  The surrounding 
landscape also includes a large gun from HMAS Adelaide and First World War one guns.  The courtyard 
between the AWM building and ANZAC Hall is planted with pencil pines.
Anzac Parade
Anzac Parade is one of the major cultural landscapes of Australia.  It is a broad ceremonial avenue named 
in honour of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps.  Set along the land axis – a key feature of 
Griffin’s 1912 plan – it stretches from near the north shore of Lake Burley Griffin to the foot of the AWM, 
along the line of sight from Parliament House.  Along each side of the road is a row of 11 memorials 
commemorating specific military campaigns or services.  They are mostly sculptures in a variety of styles 
ranging from naturalistic to Modernist.  The memorials relate to Anzac Parade and Anzac Park: both sides 
of Anzac Parade are bounded by Anzac Park; the tree-covered, sloping grassy strips at the interface of the 
parade and the park feature 10 symmetrically placed aprons prepared for national memorials.  Anzac 
Parade is a distinguishable landmark, particularly from Mount Ainslie.  The red gravel (some say 
symbolising blood) and the mixed plantings of Australian blue gums and New Zealand Hebe species link 
the parliamentary zone to the northern lakeshore.
Desert Mounted Corps Memorial (also known as the ‘Light Horse Memorial’, 1968) 
The memorial commemorates Australians and New Zealanders who served in Egypt, Palestine and Syria 
from 1916-1918.  Designed by sculptor Ray Ewers OAM, the memorial is a free-standing, cast bronze 
figurative sculpture on a granite base.  It depicts an Australian Light Horseman defending a New

Zealander beside his wounded horse.  The memorial is a recreation of a memorial in Port Said in Egypt 
which was destroyed during the 1956 Suez Crisis.
Royal Australian Air Force Memorial (1981, altered in 2001) 
The memorial commemorates the Royal Australian Air Force’s 50th anniversary and honours those who 
served throughout its history.  Designed by sculptor Inge King, it features three upward-surging wing 
shapes in stainless steel, representing endurance, strength and courage of the personnel.  The bronze flight 
image at the centre of the composition embodies the struggle to conquer the elements.
Rats of Tobruk Memorial (1984) 
The memorial commemorates Australians who fought against the Germans and their allies in the siege of 
Tobruk in 1941.  Designed by architectural firm Denton Corker Marshall Pty Ltd, the memorial takes the 
form of an obelisk.  Surrounding walls portray perimeter defences and the area of the siege.  The bronze 
Eternal Flame was created by Marc Clark.  The memorial is a replica of one that was built by Australian 
soldiers during the siege in the Tobruk War Cemetery which has since been destroyed.  An inscription 
stone, all that survives of the original memorial, is incorporated into the new memorial.
Kemal Ataturk Memorial (1985) 
The memorial honours Kemal Ataturk and the heroism and self-sacrifice of ANZAC and Turkish troops 
during the Gallipoli campaign.  Designed by architectural firm PDCM Pty Ltd, the memorial consists of a 
crescent-shaped wall surrounding a cobble paved area.  The wall represents the crescent symbol and five 
pointed star of the Turkish flag.  The centre of the memorial includes a capsule of soil from the Gallipoli 
battlefields.  A bronze portrait of Ataturk, designed by Turkish sculptor Huzeyin Gezer, is mounted on the 
wall.  Underneath is an inscription of Ataturk’s words that pay tribute to the ANZACs and reflect on the 
awful cost of war.  Surrounding the memorial are pine trees grown from seed collected from the Gallipoli 
‘lone pine’.
Royal Australian Navy Memorial (also known as ‘Sailors and Ships – Interaction and 
Interdependence’, 1986) 
The memorial commemorates those serving with the Royal Australian Navy throughout its history 
including during the First World War, the Second World War, the Malayan Emergency and Korean and 
the Vietnam and Gulf wars.  Designed by Ante Dabro in collaboration with Lester Firth and Associates 
and Robin Woodward, the memorial comprises bronze figures that represent the daily activities of naval 
life.  Moving water complements the dynamics of the sculpture.
Australian Hellenic Memorial (1988) 
The memorial commemorates those who died in campaigns in Greece and Crete (1941).  Designed by 
architects Ancher, Mortlock and Woolley Pty Ltd, the marble memorial evokes an amphitheatre set in an 
olive grove.  The short Doric column symbolises the birth of civilisation and is set in a mosaic pavement 
designed by Mary Hall.  Damaged steel fragments echo the futility of war and its destructive effects.
 
Australian Army Memorial (1989) 
The memorial recognises the contribution of Australian soldiers for their service and excellence in all 
theatres of war.  Designed by sculptors Charles Smith and Joan Walsh Smith in collaboration with 
architects Ken Maher and Partners, the memorial comprises two bronze figures representing Australian 
soldiers facing east towards the rising sun.  Seven cylindrical pillars set in water recall the seven major 
overseas conflicts and the long sea voyages involved in all Australian campaigns.  The memorial reminds 
the visitor of the importance of the Australian ‘digger’ and his role in the formation of the national 
character and sentiment.
Australian Vietnam Forces National Memorial (1992) 
The memorial commemorates the 50,000 Australians who fought in the Vietnam War.  It was designed by 
architectural firm Tonkin Zulaikha Harford and sculptor Ken Unsworth AM.  Three concrete stellae, rising 
from a shallow moat, form a dramatic centre and enclose a contemplative space.  The wall has inscriptions 
that recall political and military events and an etched photograph shows Australian troops waiting to be 
airlifted to Nui Dat, after Operation Ulmarrah.  Suspended from pillars is a halo of stones and a scroll, 
containing the names of Australians who died, is sealed into the stones.  Surrounding the memorial are six 
empty seats dedicated to the six servicemen missing in action.
Australian Service Nurses Memorial (1999)
The memorial honours past and present service nurses, who have cared for the sick and wounded since the 
South African War.  Designed by Robin Moorhouse, in conjunction with Monumental Design, the 
memorial is made of etched glass, with text and images cast into the inner walls that portray the history

and contribution of Australian Service Nursing.  The memorial includes a collage of photographs and diary 
extracts and letters in original handwriting.  Interlocking glass panels symbolise the nurturing hands of 
nursing.
Australian National Korean Memorial (2000) 
The memorial commemorates those who served in the Korean War.  It was designed by the ANKWEM 
Design Group, in conjunction with the architectural firm of Daryl Jackson Pty Ltd, and in accordance with 
the requirements of the Australia National Korean Memorial Committee.  A central walkway leads to a 
semi-enclosed contemplative space featuring a Korean boulder and a statement in Korean script 
representing peace and independence.  The use of granite, gravel and white and grey tones in the memorial 
recalls the harsh Korean climate and terrain – the lasting impressions of those who fought there.  A scroll 
represents the 21 countries that were involved in the war and bronze figures represent the involvement of 
17,000 Australians.  Fields of stainless steel posts symbolise those who died and an obelisk commemorates 
those who died with no known grave.  The inscription, taken from the United Nations memorial Cemetery 
in Pusan, creates a link with the Australians buried there.
New Zealand Memorial (2001)
The memorial commemorates the long co-operation between Australian and New Zealand and the 
ANZAC experience.  A gift from the New Zealand Government, it was designed by Kingsley Baird and 
Studio Pacific Architecture from New Zealand.  The memorial is a bronze representation of the handles of 
a flax basket, an important element of New Zealand culture.  It is 11 metres high and stretches as if to 
cross Anzac Parade.  At the base of each handle is a paved gathering space, that are landscaped areas with 
Maori and Aboriginal artworks.  At the centre of the paving on each side is buried soil from Gallipoli, the 
birth of the ANZAC tradition, and the names of the campaigns where New Zealanders and Australians 
fought together are inscribed on the paving.  The memorial’s basket handles symbolise cooperation, 
mutual experiences and sharing the load.
History
The concept of a national war museum to commemorate the sacrifice and loss of Australians in the war* 
originated in London with Australia’s official war correspondent, Charles Bean, and officers of the AIF 
during the First World War.  The idea took hold while Bean was visiting Pozières in France, where 
Australia suffered 23,000 casualties in less than seven weeks of fighting in 1916.  Bean's idea was to set 
aside a place in Australia where families and friends could grieve for those buried in places far away and 
difficult to visit – a place that would also contribute to an understanding of war itself.  His vision evolved 
over the following years for a national memorial to function as both a shrine for those who died in the war 
and to house relics and trophies from the battlefields.  Bean was later commissioned to write the official 
history of the First World War and was active in establishing a war records body in Australia.  Australia 
gained control of Australia’s war records from 1916 and John Treloar was appointed to head a new 
Australian War Records Section in May 1917.  In early 1917 the Commonwealth Government gave 
support for Bean's concept of a national war memorial in Canberra.  The Australian War Museum 
Committee (AWMC) was established in 1919 and Henry Gullett was appointed as the Director.
The Federal Capital Territory (later the Australian Capital Territory) was created as the nation’s capital in 
Canberra in 1911.  Walter Burley Griffin won the international competition for the design in 1912 and his 
design was revised and gazetted in 1918.  He proposed a central area featuring a series of artificially 
modelled lake basins and a land axis extending from Mount Ainslie, through the centre of a group of 
government buildings on the south side of the proposed central lake basin.  A national war 
memorial/museum was not part of Griffin’s plan.  Following Griffin’s departure in 1920, the development 
of Canberra was taken over by the Federal Capital Advisory Committee, chaired by architect and planner, 
John Sulman.
A Canberra site for the national war memorial was first considered in about 1919 and the Commonwealth 
Government later announced the site at the northern end of the land axis below Mount Ainslie.  In 1923, 
Bean and the AWMC indicated their preference to the Federal Capital Advisory Committee for the 
national war memorial and its collection* – it should ‘not be colossal in scale, but rather a gem of its kind’.  
The building should be ‘in the nature of a temple surrounded by a garden of its own’ and the collection 
should not be massive as might be expected in Britain, France or America (McKernan 1991: 94-95).  The 
Australian War Memorial (AWM) was constituted under the Australian War Memorial Act 1925 and it 
was given a prominent and symbolic site on Griffin’s land axis, opposite Parliament House and separate 
from the governmental and civic groups.  This was similar to Lutyen’s New Delhi, where the All-India 
War Memorial Arch (1921-31) and the Viceroy’s Palace were to face each other at opposite ends of a 
ceremonial avenue.  Griffin supported the prominent siting of the AWM.  The project was to cost no more 
than £250,000.

The competition for the AWM was conducted in 1925-26.  The entries were assessed by Professor Leslie 
Wilkinson, Sir Charles Rosenthal and John Smith Murdoch (Commonwealth’s Director-General of 
Works).  Short listed entries were sent to London for adjudication by Sir Reginald Blomfield, designer of 
works for the Imperial War Graves Commission.  None of the entries met all of the competition conditions 
and no winner was announced.  Two competitors, Emil Sodersteen and John Crust, were asked to develop 
a new collaborative design to incorporate Sodersteen’s architectural style and Crust’s innovative and cost 
cutting approach.  Sodersteen and Crust presented their design in 1927.  The architectural style was 
primarily Sodersteen's and drew on the recent art deco style, while the form of the building was strongly 
influenced by Crust's intention to incorporate a commemorative courtyard for the Roll of Honour (Pearson 
& Crocket 1995: 10-11; Inglis 1998: 341).  The competition committee also had an influence on the 
design.
Construction began in early 1928 but was curtailed and postponed by the onset of the Depression.  In 1934 
work started again in a limited way by builders Simmie and Company.  The design underwent many 
changes throughout its fourteen years of construction and major details were not resolved until 1938.  
Crust supervised the completion of the building following disputes between Sodersteen and the AWM 
Board, and Sodersteen and Crust, which resulted in Sodersteen’s resignation in 1938 (McKernan 1991: 
10).  In 1935, the collections and staff were moved into parts of the building.  The AWM was officially 
opened on 11 November 1941 although some areas were not completed until many years later.  At this 
time, the AWM comprised the main building, a ‘gun park’ enclosure at the rear of the building, the 
commemorative stone for the building (1929) and the Lone Pine tree (1934).  The Roll of Honour was not 
yet completed in the cloisters, the Hall of Memory was unbuilt and the grounds were not yet landscaped.
The AWM’s role has expanded several times since its opening and extensions were made to the building to 
reflect this.  The legislation was amended in 1941 to include Australia’s involvement in the Second World 
War and plans to extend the building were prepared from 1947 but these were not built for some years.  In 
1952, the AWM’s role was expanded to include Australia’s involvement in all armed conflicts, and this 
was further broadened in 1973 to allow the commemoration of Australians who were not in the armed 
forces.  Key changes to the AWM since its opening have included: the Administration Building designed 
by Denton Corker and Marshall (1988); installation of stained glass windows in the Hall of Memory 
(1950); installation of Ewer’s statue in the Hall of Memory (1955); installation of mosaics in the Hall of 
Memory (1955-58); opening of the Hall of Memory (1959); completion of the Roll of Honour (1967); 
major extensions (1968-71); alterations including new stairs, theatre, western entrance and a bookshop 
(1983-84); and removal of Ewer’s stature; and the interment of an AIF soldier into the newly constructed 
Tomb of the Unknown Australian Soldier in the Hall of Memory (Armistice Day 1993).  ANZAC Hall, a 
new exhibition space to house the AWM’s large technology objects, was designed by Denton Corker and 
Marshall in 1999 and completed in 2001.
The design and installation of the AWM’s landscaping has undergone substantial changes.  The open 
landscape surrounding the main building initially reflected Crust and Parramore’s 1940 design but this was 
modified by later works.  From 1942-45, the commemorative courtyard was the venue for ANZAC Day 
and commemorative services.  A new setting was needed when it could no longer accommodate everyone 
who wished to attend.  In 1959 Meldrum and Noad designed an amphitheatre and parade ground for 
commemorative services.  Roads and car parks for the AWM were planned in 1965-69 and the paved 
display area to the west of the building dates from the late 1960s (Pearson & Crocket 1995: 42-44; 
Freeman 2004: 4).  In 1999 a new Sculpture Garden, based on a design by JFW Architects, was opened to 
the west of the main building.
Anzac Park and Anzac Parade were created in the 1960s and have become important settings for war 
memorials commemorating Australian’s involvement in war.  The National Capital Development 
Commission (NCDC) architects and landscape architects Gareth Roberts and Richard Clough collaborated 
on the design of Anzac Parade and its architectural elements, as part of the 1961 wider proposals for 
Commonwealth Park and Lake Burley Griffin foreshores.  Two portal buildings, Anzac Park East and 
Anzac Park West, were completed in 1965 and 1966 respectively.  Queen Elizabeth II opened Anzac 
Parade on ANZAC Day 1965 – the fiftieth anniversary of the landing at Gallipoli.  Since the 1960s, a 
series of memorials have evolved along each side of Anzac Parade under the auspices of the NCDC and 
the National Capital Authority.  Anzac Parade is the major national venue for the Anzac Day march and 
other ceremonies to commemorate those who served Australia in times of war.  The AWM is one of the 
termini of the Remembrance Driveway from Sydney to Canberra initiated by Queen Elizabeth in 1954

AWM: The design of the building, galleries and displays has evolved over a long period of time, while the 
overall form of the building has generally not changed.  The 1968-71 extension of the transepts is in 
sympathy with this form.  The interior spaces including the galleries have been much altered over the years 
and the original skylights were modified and then closed.  The essential and integrated relationship of the 
relics, records and memorial spaces, which was part of the early conception for the AWM, remains 
strongly expressed.  Refer to the description and history for further details of the changes.
Anzac Hall: As erected.
Condition
AWM: The building is currently in fair to good condition.  The conservation management plan (Pearson 
and Crocket 1995) for Bligh Voller Nield identified several problem areas.  Cracks in the masonry and 
concrete construction appeared before the building's completion and these have continued.  Over time, 
cracking has affected the backgrounds for dioramas (subsequently repaired or replaced) and the Hall of 
Memory where it is a continuing conservation concern.  The building has also suffered stonework 
deterioration and water leaks.  Much of the damage has been restored since 1995.  The conservation 
management plan now requires updating.
ANZAC Hall: The building is in good condition.
Anzac Parade: Refer to National Capital Authority web site and studies.

Summary Statement of Significance:
Design Importance 
The Parliament House Vista is the central designed landscape of Canberra, that expresses the core of the 
Walter Burley Griffin design vision for Canberra. It is highly significant for its symbolic representation of 
the democratic interchange between the people and their elected representatives and its use of the natural 
landforms to generate a strong planning geometry. It expresses a masterly synthesis and ordering of 
topographical features and administrative functions to meet the needs of a national capital. The vista 
landscape embraces the central land axis and part of the water axis and most of the Parliamentary Triangle 
including the area known as the Parliamentary Zone. The significance incorporates Walter Burley Griffin's 
vision for the area, as the focus of Commonwealth parliamentary and governmental activity as well as 
national cultural life. This vision has been partly realised and the place is the setting for major, government, 
judicial and cultural institutions. The northern extent of the vista of Anzac Parade and the Australian War 
Memorial, despite differing from the original plan, are significant for memorial purposes developed in 
response to the needs of the people. Despite being modified to a lesser degree to accommodate the impact of 
wars on Australians, the Vista now presents as a philosophical concept expressed in urban planning, 
landscape and architecture, to achieve a grand vision of a symbolic, unified and visually dramatic place 
(Criterion F.1) 
(Australian Historic Themes 7.4 Federating Australia, 8.10 , Pursuing excellence in the arts and sciences) 
The Parliament House Vista incorporating the central national area, is the core of the most ambitious and 
most successful example of twentieth century urban planning in Australia. It is important for its design 
pattern with large landscape and waterscape spaces with their enframement by treed avenues and at the lake 
by bridges, the terminal vista features of the Australian War Memorial and Mount Ainslie at the northern 
end and Parliament House at the southern end, with the Carillon and Captain Cook Jet creating balanced 
vertical features in the water plane (Criterion F.1). 
The spatial setting of the buildings as features in the landscape reflects Beaux Arts planning concepts and 
the building masses and their careful location complement the significance of the overall landscape pattern. 
Across the Parliamentary Triangle, the buildings of Old Parliament House, and East and West Blocks 
provide a distinctive Stripped Classical architectural patterned horizontal band, that contributes to the 
symmetrical overall patterning of the landscape. At a higher elevation, Parliament House is a significant 
feature terminating the southern end of the land axis, culminating the classical landmark image of the 
triangle apex. The John Gorton Building (the former Administrative Building) and the Treasury Building 
balance the composition on King George Terrace while at the Lake edge the post-war architecture of the 
National Library of Australia and the High Court - National Gallery Precinct are prominent modern 
architectural forms and have a significant historical layering effect. The Portal Buildings provide balanced 
building massing at the southern end of Anzac Parade (Criterion F.1). 
Avenues of trees along the terraces, roads and pathways of deciduous, pine, and eucalypt species provide 
colour, character, and contrast, emphasising the significance of the formal symmetrical design. Lombardy 
Poplars in groups of four, form sentinels at key locations. Water fountains, and statues also reinforce the 
significance of the total design pattern of the place. On the northern expanse of the vista the landscape 
pattern is the wide sweeping avenue space emphasised by red scoria gravel in the central strip and edged by 
large Blue Gums (Criterion F.1). 
The vista landscape is significant for its richness of features. Many places in the Vista area have individual 
heritage significance for their architectural design and historic importance. These include Old Parliament 
House and Curtilage, East Block Government Offices, West Block and the Dugout, John Gorton Building, 
the National Library of Australia, the High Court of Australia, the National Gallery of Australia, Blundells 
Farmhouse, Slab Outbuildings and Surrounds, the Australian War Memorial, the Portal Buildings, The High 
Court - National Gallery Precinct, the Carillon, and King George V Memorial (Criteria F.1 and A3). 
Within the area are important parklands and gardens enhancing the significance of the landscape setting. 
These include the Gardens of Old Parliament House (the former Senate and House of Representative

Gardens), important for expressing their history in plantings, sports facilities, modest features and layout 
pattern. Also important is the Sculpture Garden of the National Gallery, a significant native style garden, 
and the National Rose Gardens. Commonwealth Park, the Peace Park, the Lakeshore Promenade and Kings 
Park are important landscapes for their design and popular use (Criteria F.1 and A3.) 
Adding to the richness of the place is the manner in which Griffin's vision of democracy has also been 
emphasised, as places within the area have become identified with political protest actions by people, as 
exemplified in the significant Aboriginal Embassy site (Criteria F.1 and A3).
Historic Importance 
The central national area of Canberra is strongly associated with the history of politics and government in 
Australia and the development of Canberra as the Australian National Capital. It is significant as the home 
of the Commonwealth Parliament, the focus of the Federal Government since 1927, initially in the Old 
Parliament House and from 1988 in the new Parliament House. The various government buildings in the 
area reinforce the association with Australian government and political history, including East and West 
Blocks, the Administrative Building, the Treasury Building and the High Court. The latter, being set apart 
from Parliament House but facing it is symbolic of the judicial role of the High Court as a physical 
representation of the separation of powers (Criterion A.4, Australian Historic Themes: 7.2 Developing 
institutions of self-government and democracy). 
The central national area has strong links with the planning and development of Canberra as the Australian 
Capital. The relocation of Parliament to Canberra and the central national area in 1927 was the focus of an 
intense period of development of the new city and gave purpose to Canberra as the Nation's Capital. Over 
time this association has been reinforced by the construction of major government buildings in the area, 
such as the Treasury Building, the Administration Building (now John Gorton Building), the Portal 
Buildings and latterly the new Parliament House, as well as the construction of major cultural institutions. 
The area as intended has become the focus of Commonwealth parliamentary and governmental activity as 
well as, to some extent, national cultural life. (Criterion A.4) (Australian Historic Themes: 4.1 Planning 
urban settlement, 7.2 Developing institutions of self-government and democracy, 7.3 Federating Australia). 
The area has been associated since 1941 with the development of Australian cultural life and national 
identity through the presence of such institutions as the Australian War Memorial, the National Gallery of 
Australia, the National Science and Technology Centre and the National Library of Australia. The national 
cultural institutions reinforce the national character of the area and are an important symbolic group in 
Australia's national cultural life. The Australian War Memorial and Anzac Parade memorials and, to a lesser 
extent, the other memorials have and continue to play a very important role in fostering aspects of national 
identity, in particular the Australian War Memorial through its role as a National Shrine for all Australians 
(Criterion A.4, Australian Historic Themes 8.8 Remembering the Fallen). 
Social Importance 
The area has strong and special associations with the broad Australian community because of its social 
values as a symbol of Australia and Federal Government. The values have developed over many years since 
Canberra's creation and the relocation of the Parliament in 1927 gave them a special focus. The special 
association is reflected in the use of the area as the location for national memorials, the number of tourists 
who have and continue to visit the area, the media portrayal of Canberra and federal politics and the 
continuing use of the area as the venue for occasional ceremonies and political protests by sections of the 
community. Memorial features include sculptures, plaques, commemorative trees, water features and 
gardens. The collection of sculptures, associated art and design which comprise the Anzac Parade 
Memorials, give expression to key aspects of the history of Australia's armed forces and Australia's war 
involvement, and possess high social value (Criterion G.1, Australian Historic Themes 8.8 Remembering 
the fallen, 8.9 Commemorating significant events and people). 
The special association for the community is also the use of the area by people demonstrating against 
government decisions. The central national area, particularly Parkes Place in front of Old Parliament House, 
has been used for countless demonstrations (Criterion G.1). 
The landscape spaces are important for social activities of visitors and Canberra residents and these include 
Canberra festivals, water events, national events and parades such as Anzac Day Parade and the Dawn 
Service, and other commemorative services (Criterion G.1). 
Aesthetic Value

The place has high aesthetic significance due to the visual impact of the extensive open sweeping vista 
along the land axis that can be experienced in two directions, the designed axes set within natural features of 
forested hills, patterns and textures of architectural massing accentuated by planned open spaces, water 
planes and tree plantings that are arranged across the area. The vista is significant for its visual drama with 
its ability to engage viewers in the visual perspective of the sweeping vista to the terminal features. The 
aesthetic significance is also a result of the large scale qualities of the axes, including the open green spaces, 
combined with patterns and symmetrical characteristics of the road networks and numerous designed 
smaller attributes. These include the rose gardens, the Old Parliament House Gardens, Commonwealth Park, 
the street tree plantings, the lake-land interface and the Sculpture Garden of the National Gallery, and many 
intimate spaces rich in texture, colour, fragrance and in some cases, art works and water features (Criterion 
E1). 
Associational Value 
The central national area has a special association with its designer, Walter Burley Griffin. Griffin is an 
important figure in Australia's cultural history for his overall design of Canberra as the Nation's Capital. The 
special association between the central national area and Griffin results from the area being the centrepiece 
of the planning geometry for Canberra and perhaps the only part of his Canberra plan to survive relatively 
intact. The area has a strong association with Marion Mahoney Griffin who prepared the perspective 
drawings of the Vista. The Vista area has a strong association with numerous architects and planners, in 
particular John Smith Murdoch, Chief architect of the Commonwealth Government, and Thomas Charles 
Weston, Superintendent of Parks, Gardens and Afforestation in Canberra, and notable planners of the 
National Capital Development Commission such as Sir John Overall, Peter Harrison and Paul Reid 
(Criterion H.1).

HISTORY 
The Australian Constitution left the location of the Capital to be decided by the new Federal Parliament. It 
declared that Melbourne would be the temporary home for the Federal Parliament and public servants until 
a new city was built at least 100 miles from Sydney. An agreed territory of 903 square miles included the 
water catchment of the Cotter River and the river valley of the Molonglo for the setting for the city. The 
Department of Home Affairs commenced works for services and city planning. In 1910 the Secretary of the 
Federal Department of Home Affairs, David Miller requested permission of Minister O'Malley to conduct a 
design competition to elicit ideas for the city. 
At the time the Federal Capital area was proclaimed, the river flats of the Molonglo, Mount Ainslie, Camp 
Hill and Kurrajong Hill had been extensively denuded of vegetation from a long period of clearing and 
grazing. Some exotic trees were established in parts of the area, around structures such as Blundell's cottage 
and St Johns Church and graveyard. 
The Canberra Plan 
Walter Burley Griffin won the competition for the design of Canberra in 1912. The plan was expressed in 
beautifully rendered illustrations prepared by Griffin's wife Marion Mahoney Griffin as plans, elevations 
and sections painted on silk. 
The order of the city was for a great triangle aligned with the mountains which rose above the site. The 
triangle was to be defined by tree-lined avenues and spanned the central basin of an impounded lake. The 
triangle would consist of a series of terraces arranged in the functions of government and representing 
democracy. It was a synthesis of function and design where the Order of the Site (the natural environment) 
and the Order of Functions (the needs of the people) are perfectly integrated by specific geometry (Reid 
2002). The Capitol was a main feature of the design 
In terms of vistas, the Griffin vision was represented in two renderings drawn by Marion Mahony Griffin. In 
the rendering looking from Mt Ainslie towards the Capitol, the drama of the vista focuses on the Capitol, 
the building representing the aspirational forces in Australian national life, with the final termination in the 
mountains beyond. Below the Capitol, the Parliament House and the Government departments are terraced 
down to the Lake providing a symbol of a transparent democracy in action. The observer is standing at Mt 
Ainslie, a point representative of the power and influence of nature and the highest point of the vista. 
Griffin's plan for the ideal city, the philosophical triumvirate of humanity, democracy and nature is 
iconographed along the land axis which together with the water axis is the ordering geometry of the vista 
and the city. Griffin envisaged a dense city with a coming together of the population in a Casino (something 
akin to the recreational city gardens in pre war Berlin, Copenhagen, and Stockholm) and Plaisance 
descending from the foot of Mt Ainslie. Intersected by a busy commercial street, Constitution Avenue, the 
Plaisance unfolded to the area designated for cultural activity from which the people could look across the 
lake (or water axis) to the area of national government that was climaxed by the building symbolic of 
national achievement and aspiration, the Capitol.

Griffin's 1913 land use plan for the central National area indicates his intentions. Moving from north to 
south along the land axis, he proposed a park at the northern end of the land axis, public gardens on the 
north side of the lake, the lake itself (now Lake Burley Griffin), government buildings flanking a central 
terrace court to the south of the lake, Parliament House on Camp Hill, the Capitol building on Capital Hill 
flanked by the Governor General's residence to the west and the Prime Minister's residence to the east. The 
Capitol building was not intended to be the Parliament but rather to be for popular reception and ceremonial 
activities or for archives or otherwise to commemorate Australian achievements. Griffin's philosophical 
vision expressed in a remarkable urban planning form has been affected by the realities of Australian 
political and cultural life as well as by the circumstances and juxtapositions of historic events. Australian 
planners following Griffin have rearranged the icons to reflect the dominant realities and meanings of 
Australian life. 
Griffin's various plans for the central National area of Canberra all included a basic planning framework, 
which has been constructed and survives to the present. This framework includes the land axis, joining 
Capital Hill and Mount Ainslie, the water axis, the radiating avenues from Capital Hill, Commonwealth and 
Kings Avenues, the arc of Parkes Way, the northern punctuation of the land axis by the Australian War 
Memorial, the roads encircling Capital Hill, State and Capital Circles and the southern punctuation of the 
land axis by the Parliament House of 1988. In addition to the alignment of axes and avenues which defined 
Griffin's city plan the triangle was a basic element on which the whole city was built. In his design Griffin 
had created three urban centres connected by main avenues. Capital Hill as the government centre, Mt 
Vernon as the municipal centre and Mt Pleasant as the market centre were integral to the plan. The northern 
avenue, Constitution Avenue, was the municipal axis. 
Griffin prepared a preliminary plan in 1913 and a revised plan in 1918 following which the Official Plan 
was gazetted in 1925. Griffin left in 1920 leaving development under the control of the Federal Capital 
Advisory Committee (FCAC) chaired by the planner, John Sulman. The Committee had been appointed to 
complete sufficient permanent buildings to enable Parliament to move from Melbourne to Canberra. 
Development 
Tree planting began in the early years of Canberra's development, and by 1921 some 17,000 trees were 
planted (Hendry). Within the Vista area tree planting commenced around 1923 in Prospect Parkway, now 
known as Anzac Parade. Early images show tree planting in a scalloped arrangement along the length of the 
avenue 
For 3 years from 1925, trees were planted in association with the construction of the Provisional Parliament 
House. The formal structural planting around the House including Cedars, Cypresses and Lombardy Poplars 
was completed for the opening (Hendry). The planting proposals were finalised by Charles Weston, 
Superintendent of Parks, Gardens and Afforestation, and from 1926, carried out by his successor Alexander 
Bruce. The planting design aimed to create through the use of a balanced mix of evergreen and deciduous 
trees, formally shaped grassed vistas and 'outdoor rooms' in scale with the Provisional Parliament House. 
The formally arranged groups of Lombardy Poplars to achieve 'sentinel' features at the entrances and the 
pedestrian reference points in the landscape, is attributed to the involvement of John Smith Murdoch, Chief 
Architect for the Commonwealth Government, in the design. Cedars were used at right angles to the Land 
Axis. Most of the trees planted in Parkes Place were exotics with the only eucalypts planted adjacent to the 
Senate and House of Representatives Gardens (Gray 1995). 
The first major structure to be placed within the area was the Old Parliament House, then called the 
Provisional Parliament House. In 1923 the Commonwealth Parliament agreed to the proposed building 
which was sited in front of Camp Hill, Griffin's intended location of the permanent Parliament House. At 
the time, Griffin protested recognising that if built, the provisional building would remove any possibility of 
a permanent Parliament House being built on Camp Hill. Nonetheless the Commonwealth proceeded. In 
1925 the Federal Capital Commission (FCC) was established under Sir John Butters. The Commission 
replaced the FCAC. The FCC was responsible for moving the public service to Canberra and otherwise 
establishing the city in time for the opening of Parliament House. 
A number of other significant projects were undertaken at the same time as the construction of (Old) 
Parliament House, which was designed by John Smith Murdoch and completed in 1927. Either side of the 
Parliament House, private gardens were established for the use of Members of Parliament. On either side of 
Camp Hill, two government office buildings were constructed, known as East and West Blocks and these 
were also completed in 1927. East and West Blocks were also designed by Murdoch in a similar style to Old 
Parliament House. 
In 1926 a delegation of the Empire Parliamentary Association visited the new Parliament House and planted

an avenue of 12 commemorative trees, to mark the event of the first use of the House of Representatives. 
Ten Roman Cypresses (CUPRESSUS SEMPERVIRENS 'STRICTA') were planted at right angles to the 
House with each tree planted by a delegate and marked by a brass plaque. To commemorate the opening of 
Parliament House in 1927, the Duke of York planted a Bunya Pine (ARUACARIA BIDWILLI) near Kings 
Avenue. The Marquis of Salisbury and Mr Arthur Henderson planted the Lombardy poplars in the 
courtyards of the Provisional Parliament House (Pryor and Banks 1991, Gray 1995). 
In 1927 the Canberra National Memorials Committee named the area in front of Parliament House - Parkes 
Place, to commemorate Sir Henry Parkes. King Edward, King George and Queen Victoria Terraces, and 
Langton and Walpole Crescents were named for links to the first 50 years of Federation (Gray 1995). 
The Gardens designed and constructed as part of the Old Parliament House Complex was conceived by the 
Federal Capital Advisory Committee in the early 1920s and constructed by the Federal Capital Commission 
from the mid 1920s in time for the opening of Parliament in May 1927. Formal enclosed gardens were the 
style of the time and James Orwin of the Sydney office of the Director of Works for NSW prepared sketch 
plans that were finalised by Murdoch. Most of the trees for the Parliamentary gardens were planted by late 
1925. Around the same time road patterns for the Parliamentary area following Griffin's concepts were 
prepared. 
Formal rose gardens in front of the House were first proposed by Weston in 1924. The idea was finally 
realised when the National Rose Gardens were established in 1933 by the Canberra Horticultural Society in 
association with the Department of the Interior. The design was developed by A. Bruce based on the plan of 
petals of an open bloom with colours arranged from deep red in the central area progressing through yellow, 
white pink and coppery shades. Rose gardens were also commenced around the same time in the Senate and 
House of Representatives Gardens. By 1938, these gardens were established with formal garden beds and 
recreation courts, and surrounded by young cypresses which were later clipped into hedges (Patrick and 
Wallace). 
Following the opening of the Provisional Parliament House by the Duke of York on 9 May 1927, the area in 
front of the House was used for official ceremonies for Anzac and Remembrance Days with a temporary 
cenotaph, until the opening of the Australian War Memorial in 1941. Initially this area had simple 
landscaping treatment of lawns. Rose gardens were added in the 1950s, and the car parking area in the 
forecourt added in the 1960s. 
Weston and Murdoch were both given British Empire Awards in 1927 for their contribution to the nation. 
In 1946 a major tree thinning of the Parliamentary Zone was initiated by Lindsay Pryor, Superintendent, 
Parks and Gardens. All the golden cypresses, white poplars, pin oaks and Lawson's cypress on King George 
Terrace were removed (Gray 1995). 
In order to accommodate other government departments, a competition was held in 1924 for the design of 
the Administrative building, flanking the land axis in Parkes, which was to house about eight departments. 
The building was to be the first in the Parliamentary Triangle and its design was considered important 
because it would influence future buildings in the central National area. In 1924, G Sydney Jones won the 
competition. Work started in 1927 and the foundations were completed in 1928. However, work was 
stopped at this point because of the Depression. There were then many delays. The design of the proposed 
building was modified in 1946, construction started again in 1947 and the new design required the 
demolition of the original foundations. The building was substantially completed in 1956. The building is 
claimed to have been the largest Australian office building when completed. It was renamed as the John 
Gorton Building in 1999. 
The major development at the northern end of the land axis was the construction of the Australian War 
Memorial. The site was agreed in 1923 and in 1928 Griffin expressed the view that the proposed site was 
suitable for the memorial. Construction began in 1928 but was not completed until 1941. 
Although a memorial to King George V was proposed in 1936 it was not until 1941 that the architectural 
part was constructed but the bronze figure was not developed until after World War II. It was unveiled in 
1953 but attracted criticism for blocking the vista to the Australian War Memorial. In 1968 King George 
Terrace was realigned and the memorial was moved to its current location west of the land axis, on a corner 
of the western part of the National Rose Garden.
In 1955 a Select Senate Committee of Inquiry urged tree planting and landscape works to be undertaken in 
Canberra under the direction of the National Capital Development Commission. The Commission sought 
guidance from landscape designers including Lord William Holford and Dame Sylvia Crowe. Holford

recommended that a predominantly Australian character be retained around Lake Burley Griffin with 
autumn coloured foliage trees used in a dramatic way. Parliament House was to be built on the lakeside with 
a great forecourt. In 1968 the lakeshore location was rejected in favour of Camp Hill or Capital Hill. During 
the 1960s, the landscaping of the Parliamentary Triangle was modified to create more formality in Parkes 
Place. This included realigning roads, installing the four fountains in the pools in the land axis, paving and 
the relocation King George V statue. 
The National Capital Development Commission (NCDC) Act of 1957 set in motion a significant phase in 
the development of Canberra with the support of Robert Menzies Liberal government. The report of British 
Town Planner Sir William Holford stressed the need for 'unified design' for Canberra. This view was 
supported by the Senate Select Committee which propagated Holford's concept of a 'park like landscape...in 
the heart of Canberra, in which monumental buildings functioned both as symbols of government and of 
Australian unity'. The visual design of this landscape, the views along the main axial lines and avenues as 
well as the grouping of monumental buildings were considered to be the elements upon which the success of 
Canberra as a city of world standing depended. Holford's recommendations included siting the future houses 
of parliament on the lakeside and developing two monumental buildings on the municipal axis north of a 
new road connection, which became Parkes Way. The NCDC's acceptance of the Holford vision set the 
design context for the completion of Anzac Parade and the construction of the Portal Buildings under the 
direction of NCDC architects and planners. The Portal Buildings have heritage significance. 
After a number of schemes for Canberra's lake, detailed planning of the Lake edges was begun in 1954. 
Lake Burley Griffin was created in 1964 by the damming of the Molonglo River by Scrivener Dam. It 
reached its predicted level of 556 metres in the same year. The northern shore of the lake between 
Commonwealth and Kings Avenues was landscaped from about this time to create Commonwealth and 
Kings Parks. In 1970, two vertical features were opened in the central basin of the lake. The Carillon, 
located on Aspen Island in the eastern part of the central basin, was a gift from the British Government to 
mark the fiftieth Jubilee of the founding of Canberra in 1963. In the western part of the central basin is the 
Captain Cook Memorial water jet commissioned by the National Capital Development Commission as part 
of the Cook Bicentenary year. In 1968 a small restaurant was built on a corner of the western part of the 
National Rose Garden. 
NCDC architect and landscape architect Gareth Roberts and architect and landscape architect Richard 
Clough collaborated on the design of Anzac Parade and its architectural elements at this time. The two 
Portal Buildings, Anzac Park East and Anzac Park West, were completed in 1965 and 1966 respectively. 
With the establishment of the Australian War Memorial in the 1940s, the surrounding landscape was 
imbued with an associated symbolic character. This included the creation of Anzac Park and Anzac Parade. 
Anzac Park became the setting for a series of memorials commemorating Australian involvement and 
sacrifice in war. Anzac Parade was opened by Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II on Anzac Day 1965, the 
fiftieth anniversary of the landing of the Anzacs at Gallipoli. It is the setting for a series of memorials 
commemorating Australian involvement and sacrifice in war and is the major national venue for the Anzac 
Day March and other ceremonies to commemorate those who served Australia in times of conflict. It has a 
deep symbolism for many Australians and its vista, linking the Memorial with Parliament House, adds 
aesthetic and emotional value to the place, which has become part of one of the major cultural landscapes of 
Australia. The notion of a ceremonial space of this grandeur is not found elsewhere in Australia. 
Over time the spaces flanking the land axis to the south of the Lake have been filled with government 
buildings of varying character. These include the Treasury Building established 1967-70, the National 
Library in 1968, the High Court in 1980, National Gallery in 1982 and the National Science and Technology 
Centre in 1988. Associated with the Gallery is the extensive and significant Sculpture Garden established in 
1982. 
In 1972 an informal Aboriginal Embassy was established in front of Old Parliament House. The Embassy 
became the focus of a campaign for land and other rights for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people. In 
1992 the Embassy was re-established.
The most recent major change to the central National area was the construction of a new Parliament House 
on Capital Hill. In 1974, The site of Capital Hill for Parliament House, was chosen by a joint sitting of both 
Houses of Parliament. An Act of Parliament extended Parliamentary jurisdiction over work in the 
Parliamentary Triangle, henceforth known as the Parliamentary Zone. Completed in 1988, the building has 
resulted in a number of significant changes to the area. The relocation of the Parliament to the new building 
left the Old Parliament House without its original use. The construction of the building also resulted in the 
levelling of Camp Hill, Griffin's intended location for a Parliament House and its incorporation into the 
broader formal landscape of the new Federation Mall. Finally, the new Parliament House involved the 
construction of a large complex of buildings and extensive new landscape areas. The changes affected most

of Capital Hill. The winning design, by Mitchell, Giurgola and Thorp Architects, considered the land axis of 
Canberra as the fundamental gesture of the City, a line around which all other design has evolved in circular 
and radial directions (Reid 2002). 
During 2001-2002 new designed features were constructed across the Land Axis of the Vista landscape. 
These are Commonwealth Place and Reconciliation Place. In addition, a rotunda with exhibition, called 
Magna Carta Place is located to the west of the former Senate Garden. 
Following the construction of Parliament House, emphasis was placed on the landscape of the Parliament 
Zone. The development of Federation Mall with its trees and central space was to balance Anzac Parade and 
to complete the visual Land Axis from Capital Hill to the War Memorial. 
Use 
By the turn of the century (2000-2001), the area was used for countless public events. These include 
memorial services such as the Anzac Day March and the Dawn Service, public protest demonstrations, 
celebration events, sporting activities, water races, art displays, fireworks and large-sale concerts. In 
addition it is used by people informally for weddings, picnics, and fairs. The area is a popular destination for 
tourists and schoolchildren. 
DESCRIPTION 
The central National area of Canberra is an extensive cultural landscape comprising buildings, roads, parks, 
tree plantings and a lake. The area is designated for Parliamentary and National Capital uses. The major 
features of the area include: Parliament House with its gardens and paved areas, State Circle Cutting 
(geological feature), Old Parliament House and curtilage, East Block, West Block and the Dugout, the John 
Gorton Building, the National Gallery of Australia, the High Court of Australia, the High Court - National 
Gallery precinct, National Science and Technology Centre, the National Library of Australia, Treasury 
Building, National Rose Gardens, The Sculpture Garden of the National Gallery, King George V Memorial, 
Aboriginal Embassy, the Portal Buildings, Australian War Memorial and memorials along Anzac Parade, 
Aspen Island, the Carillon, Kings Park, HMAS Canberra Memorial, Merchant Navy Memorial, Blundell's 
Cottage, Commonwealth Park, Kings Park, the Peace Park, Regatta Point Exhibition Building and 
Restaurant, Captain Cook Memorial Water Jet, the Lakeshore Promenade, and extensive mature plantings 
and avenues of trees such as those along Anzac Parade. The area also includes fountains, roads, car parks, 
landscaped areas, a restaurant, kiosk and the residence of the Catholic Archbishop. The spaces, particularly 
the Land Axis, are a major feature. 
The central National area has a strong sense of symmetry based on the land axis. The Parliament House, Old 
Parliament House and Australian War Memorial are located on the axis. In addition, the landscape features 
of Federation Mall, Parkes Place (the landscape feature not the roads) and Anzac Parade are also located on 
the axis. Other major features in the area are generally balanced about the axis such as: East and West 
Blocks, the gardens of Old Parliament House, the Portal Buildings, the eastern and western parts of the 
National Rose Gardens, Administrative and Treasury Buildings, the National Gallery/High Court group and 
the National Library/National Science and Technology Centre group, as well as the Carillon and Captain 
Cook Memorial water jet. The road system also generally reflects the symmetrical planning of the area 
based on the land axis. 
The Anzac Parade Memorials comprises two main components, Anzac Parade and Anzac Park. Either side 
of Anzac Parade is bounded by Anzac Park. Treed sloping grassy strips contain 10 symmetrically placed 
aprons prepared for national memorials. In 2002 there were 11 memorials on Anzac Parade, tributes to the 
men and women of the Australian military. These memorials are: (1) the Australian Hellenic Memorial, 
Limestone Avenue intersection, (2) the Australian Army Memorial, near Currong Street, (3) the Australian 
National Korean Memorial, near Currong Street, (4) the Australian Vietnam forces National Memorial, 
opposite Booroondara Street, (5) the Desert Mounted Corps Memorial, opposite Amaroo Street (commonly 
known as the Light Horse Memorial), (6) the New Zealand Memorial (7) the Rats of Tobruk Memorial , 
opposite (5), (8) Royal Australian Air Force Memorial, opposite Page Street, (9) the Australian Service 
Nurses Memorial, (10) the Royal Australian Navy Memorial, and (11) Kemal Ataturk Memorial, Fairbairn 
Avenue intersection. 
The array of mature tree plantings are all regarded as important. Some are classified as notable by Pryor and 
Banks (1991) and these include CALOCEDRUS DECURRENS on King George Terrace planted in 1927, 
CUPRESSUS ARIZONICA planted in 1926 on King George Terrace, EUCALYTUS GLOBULUS at the 
Australian War Memorial, E. MAIDENII group planted c 1927. Commemorative trees in the Parkes area, 
include the CUPRESSUS SEMPERVIRENS 'Stricta' planted in 1926 by nine members of the Empire 
Parliamentary Association, ARAUCARIA Bidwilli PLANTED BY THE duke of York in 1927 to 
commemorate his visit to Canberra to open the first Parliament House and CUPRESSUS ARIZONICA,

planted by the wife of the then United States President, Mrs Lady Bird Johnson, at the time of their visit to 
Canberra in 1966. Within Commonwealth Park are a QUERCUS ROBUR planted by Princess Marina in 
1964, and a CURRESSUS GLABRA planted by Mrs Lady Bird Johnson. Within the curtilage of the 
Australian War Memorial is a PINUS HALPENSIS planted by the Duke of Gloucester in 1934, believed to 
have been raised from seed from a cone collected from Lone Pine Ridge, Gallipoli in 1915. Also in curtilage 
is a EUCALYPTUS NICHOLII to replace the E. PAUCOFORA planted by Queen Elizabeth in 1954 to 
mark the beginning of the Remembrance Driveway to Sydney (Pryor and Banks 1991). 
History: Not Available
Condition and Integrity:
The central National area is an extensive cultural landscape with a variety of landscape and building 
features. Individual elements vary in their condition and integrity. At a general level, the area is in fair to 
good condition. The values relating to the cultural landscape design and special association with Griffin are 
degraded by the changes made over time to Griffin's plan. The location of Old Parliament House, removal 
of Camp Hill, location of the new Parliament House and parts of the road layout as constructed are all 
variations from Griffin's plan. Given these changes, the area displays only a poor to medium level of 
integrity with regard to these values. In 1994 the National Capital Planning Authority released details of the 
Central National Area Design Study. This includes proposals for significant changes to the area.
Location:
About 260 ha, comprising the whole of the area bounded by the northern alignment of State Circle, the 
western alignment of Kings Avenue, the southern alignment of Parkes Way and the eastern alignment of 
Commonwealth Avenue, excluding the Archbishops Residence and grounds being Block 1 Section 2 
Parkes; the whole of Anzac Parade and Anzac Park and the whole of Section 39, Campbell.

APPENDIX C:  COMMUNITY-BASED VALUES RESEARCH 
METHODS
Social significance
The National Heritage definition of social significance under criterion (g) is,
‘the place has outstanding heritage value to the nation because of the place’s strong or special 
association with a particular community or social group for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.’
Social significance is a value held by today’s community.  While historical research may 
be able to demonstrate considerable longevity and continuity of association, this is not 
enough to demonstrate social significance.  Rather, the associated communities or cultural 
groups must hold these values.  Therefore the task of social significance research is to 
understand the nature of the associations with a place and whether this gives rise to 
significance in the terms of the definition.  It also involves understanding whether 
significance resides in the fabric of the place or in other aspects such as its use, 
accessibility or aesthetic appreciation.
Establishing social significance
Methods for assessing social significance are not defined in the national guidelines (AHC 
2009).  For this project, the methods used are those that have previously been applied to 
the assessment of National Heritage values by the consultants for this plan.
Defining a community or cultural group may involve:
•
historical research;
•
social or demographic profiling;
•
qualitative data collection and analysis;  and
•
consultation.
Establishing that an association exists may be undertaken in a number of ways including 
social research approaches (eg. surveys, observation) and anthropological techniques.
Establishing that the association is strong and/or special and is held collectively is likely to 
involve working directly with the particular communities or cultural groups.  The 
techniques used may include direct questioning and observation of behaviours.  By seeking 
a variety of evidence from different sources, it is more likely that the associations and their 
importance can be clearly established.
The approach adopted for the assessment of social significance involved considering:
•
Who are the communities or cultural groups with potential attachment to Anzac 
Parade for social, cultural or spiritual reasons?
•
What evidence is there of strong or special association or attachment, and by whom?
•
Considered nationally, are these values sufficient to demonstrate outstanding heritage 
value to the nation?

Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan

Evidence of social significance
To determine whether a place has outstanding value to the nation there needs to be:
•
evidence that the place satisfies the descriptive element of the criteria – that is 
‘strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group for 
social, cultural or spiritual reasons’;  and
•
there is evidence that it is also of ‘outstanding heritage value to the nation’.
Establishing that a value is ‘outstanding’ can be established in part by comparison with 
other broadly comparable places, or a finding that elements of a place are unique.
Guidelines designed to assist in the interpretation and application of each of the National 
Heritage criteria were released in 2009 (Australian Heritage Council).
In terms of assessing social values, the definition of three terms – strong, special and 
association in the guidelines is of particular importance:
•
strong is defined as meaning of ‘great force, effectiveness, potency or cogency, and 
firm or unfaltering under trial’ (Macquarie Dictionary 4th Edition 2005);
•
special is defined as of a distinct or particular character, distinguished or different 
from what is ordinary or usual – extraordinary, exceptional, especial (Macquarie 
Dictionary 4th Edition 2005);  and
•
association means associated with or connected with (Macquarie Dictionary 4th 
Edition 2005).
In terms of the phrase ‘particular’ community or cultural group the guidelines suggest that 
particular refers to a specific or definable or identifiable community or cultural group.  
Community or cultural group has been defined to mean a group or body of people that 
share characteristics such as social organisation and locality (eg. a locality and its 
community), culture (ethnicity, culture, beliefs, traditions), or spiritual values.  In the 
assessment of social significance, the sharing of deeply felt experiences and activities can 
also create a community (eg. a group of people who train for and experience war service 
together;  people who work closely together, etc).  However, the guidelines are clear that a 
group of people who only share ‘common expertise’ – for example a professional group or 
special interest group – would not usually constitute a community or cultural group.
Threshold tests are applied to each criterion.  For social significance, the threshold tests 
include:
•
that it is people within a particular community or cultural group that collectively have 
the strong or special associations;
•
that the community or cultural group is clearly identifiable (ie. particular);
•
that there is clear evidence that the community or cultural group has a connection – a 
strong or special association – with the place;  and
•
the connection or association is enduring and that there is a deep sense of ownership 
or connectedness.
Generally the expectation is that the association is evident today, although the guidelines 
note that in some cases significant former associations by past communities or cultural 
groups may meet the threshold.
To be of ‘outstanding heritage value to the nation’ it is generally expected that:
•
community recognition will usually be beyond the region or state (note that this is 
not a requirement, as there may instances where this is not the case);  and
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
•
there will be extensive demonstration of caring or identification by the Australian 
community (however places that are little known may be able to achieve the 
threshold).
Indicators of social significance
An indicator of significance defines the grounds on which a place may satisfy the criterion 
noted above.  To help interpret the criterion and indicator, the guidelines note that:
•
connection to a place may include a continued association by a number of people 
(but not all of those) who comprise a community or cultural group;
•
the place may be the setting for an event, or may embody through tradition, history 
or art the representation of an event;
•
there is a strong connection between a place and a uniquely Australian cultural 
activity and if this is the reason why the particular community or cultural group has a 
strong or special association;  and
•
there is a strong association with a nationally important story which continues as a 
symbolic national story, and if this is the reason why the particular community or 
cultural group has a strong or special association.
Three more specific indicators of social value have been used in the past, and these are still 
considered relevant:
•
Important to a community or cultural group as a landmark, marker or 
signature: this indicator is about the associations and meanings that a place may 
have because of its role as a landmark or signature place (icon) for a community or 
cultural group, one that marks a community’s or cultural group’s place in the world 
physically and metaphorically.
•
Important as a reference point in a community’s or cultural group’s identity or 
sense of itself: this indicator is about associations and meanings that help create a 
sense of community or cultural group identity, such as places that help define 
collective, spiritual or traditional connections between past and present, that reflect 
important and shared meanings, that are associated with events having a profound 
effect on a community or cultural group, that symbolically represent the past in the 
present, or that represent attitudes, beliefs or behaviours fundamental to community 
or cultural group identity.
•
Strong or special attachment developed from use and/or associations: this 
indicator is designed to recognise that a place which provides an essential public or 
shared function can, over time, gain strong and special attachments through 
longevity of use or association, especially where that place serves as a shared 
meeting place (formally or informally).
These indicators have been used on a number of National and Commonwealth Heritage 
assessments and management plans.  The first indicator often strongly aligns with aesthetic 
values.
Assessing the relative strength of association, the length of association and the relative 
importance of the place to the identified community or cultural group can be important.  
Comparison with other places that have a similarly strong and special association for that 
particular community or cultural group may be helpful and revealing.  In no instance 
should these tests be interpreted as a place needing a ‘majority vote’ nor do they need 
unanimous agreement.
Aesthetic significance
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
The National Heritage definition of aesthetic significance under criterion (e) is,
‘The place has outstanding heritage value to the nation because of the place’s importance in exhibiting 
particular aesthetic characteristics valued by a community or cultural group’
Aesthetic value is the emotional response by individuals to a place or natural or cultural 
elements within it (Ramsay & Paraskevopoulos 1993).  While visual elements such as 
outstanding landforms, or compositional qualities are often preferenced in understanding 
aesthetic value, non-visual attributes (eg. sound, smell or particular understandings about 
the place) which evoke response, feeling or sense of place can also be valued as aesthetic 
characteristics.
Emotional response to place can be either positive or negative, though again the former is 
more commonly documented.  Examples of responses which indicate aesthetic value might 
include awe, inspiration, sense of peace, mystery or fear.
Research into aesthetic response can involve direct consultation (interviews, surveys), 
observation and research into the expression of aesthetic values through art, poetry, 
photography, and literature, and through popular culture through expressions such as 
community art, and snapshot web sites.
Cultural features or landscapes and natural features of landscapes with evocative qualities, 
symbolic or other associated meanings that are recognised and regarded as outstanding by 
community groups might also provide examples of aesthetic qualities.
A specific methodology was developed by the Department of the Environment, Water, 
Heritage and the Arts (now the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment) to 
support the assessment of ‘inspirational landscapes’ (Context 2003).  It offers eight 
specific indicators of significance for understanding the values of such landscape places – 
four of these indicators relate to criterion (e).  The use of this methodology is discussed 
further below.
Defining the aesthetic characteristics of the place may involve considering:
•
artistic works – art, music, poetry or literature (including Aboriginal art) inspired by 
the features of a place can provide evidence that the place may have aesthetic value;
•
expert evidence of community-held values;  and
•
technical studies such as landscape and visual assessments.
The methodologies for defining aesthetic characteristics are not described in the current 
National Heritage guidelines (AHC 2009).  Instead the consultants have adopted the 
approaches used for previous National Heritage values assessments.
The types of evidence that can be useful in establishing that a community or cultural group 
values the aesthetic characteristics of a place may include:
•
methods designed to find out directly what communities or cultural groups value, for 
example, surveys, focus group workshops, interviews, place surveys (eg. visitor 
surveys), perception studies;
•
historical research to investigate the continuity of connections and values;
•
contemporary images and expressions used or created by a particular community or 
cultural group (including snapshots, logos, naming, etc);
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
•
artistic appreciations of the place – what evidence is there that the place has been the 
subject of artistic endeavours, based on the idea that such artistic endeavours may 
both reflect and influence the way a place is appreciated and responded to;
•
tourism images and descriptions used to promote a place, based on the concept that 
such imagery seeks to capture the essence of the place, for example, web sites, post 
cards, posters, publications, logos, etc;  and
•
other evidence such as wide recognition of and knowledge about a place, naming, 
stories and songs, writing, and actions by groups of people to save a place based on 
declared aesthetic attributes.
Based on the Guidelines and the Inspirational Landscapes methodology (see below), the 
approach used for Anzac Parade involved:
•
identifying the communities or cultural groups that may value the aesthetic 
characteristics of Anzac Parade;
•
through research, focus groups and interviews seeking to discern the aesthetic 
characteristics that are valued, by whom and how strongly;  and
•
finally, considering whether the aesthetic values held are sufficient to demonstrate 
national importance.
The expectation is that multiple sources of data, not just one single source, are required to 
demonstrate this value.  The extent of the data required is not defined in the guidelines.  
This plan considers a number of types of data which can be used to provide evidence of 
aesthetic appreciation.  The aim is to look at both the evidence and the strength of the 
evidence, based on existing data, combined with new material gathered through focus 
groups and interviews.
Further general detail about establishing aesthetic significance is provided below.
Evidence of aesthetic significance
To determine whether a place has outstanding value to the nation there needs to be:
•
evidence that the place satisfies the descriptive element of the criteria – that is 
‘importance in exhibiting particular aesthetic characteristics valued by a community 
or cultural group’;  and
•
evidence that it is also of ‘outstanding heritage value to the nation’.
Establishing that a value is ‘outstanding’ can be in part by comparison with other broadly 
comparable places (or a finding that elements of a place are unique).
In terms of assessing aesthetic values the definition of aesthetics and beauty in the National 
Heritage assessment guidelines (Australian Heritage Council 2009) are important:
•
aesthetic (as an adjective) is defined in the Macquarie Dictionary (2001) as ‘having 
a sense of the beautiful, characterised by the love of beauty’.  The Macquarie 
Dictionary (2005) includes ‘relating to the sense of the beautiful or the science of 
aesthetics’ and ‘having a sense of the beautiful; characterised by a love of beauty’;
•
beauty means ‘that quality or characteristic which excited an admiring pleasure or 
delights the eye or the aesthetic sense (Macquarie Dictionary, 4th Edition, 2005);  
and
•
‘exhibiting particular aesthetic characteristics’ has been interpreted as meaning that 
the place has aesthetic characteristics that are able to be defined (‘particular’) and be 
identified within the place under consideration.
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
In relation to the definition of a community or cultural group, the criterion requires 
consideration of:
•
‘valued by a community or cultural group’ – the term ‘valued’ has been interpreted 
to mean that the characteristics are appreciated, respected, esteemed, treasured, etc, 
by a group of people that can be defined as a community or as cultural group;  and
•
community or cultural group has been defined to mean a group or body of people 
that share characteristics such as social organisation and locality (eg. a locality and 
its community), culture (ethnicity, culture, beliefs, traditions), or spiritual values.  In 
the assessment of social significance, the sharing of deeply felt experiences and 
activities can also create a community (eg. a group of people who train for and 
experience war service together; people who work closely together, etc).
The guidelines clarify that a community can exist at ‘various levels’ and that there is no 
statutory requirement for a community to be substantial in size.  On the other hand, a 
community can also refer to the Australian community as a whole.
In some instances a ‘shared interest group’ may be a community, however generally 
professional groups and special interest groups are not considered to be a ‘community or 
cultural group’ – under the guidelines ‘common expertise’ is not sufficient in itself to 
define a community or cultural group.
Thresholds
Threshold tests are applied to each criterion.  For aesthetic significance, the threshold tests 
include:
•
that the community or cultural group is clearly identifiable;
•
that there is clear evidence of a community or cultural group valuing the aesthetic 
characteristics of the place;
•
that the place is valued strongly by the identifiable community or cultural group, 
with the strength of attachment being a factor that is specifically assessed on a case-
by-case basis;  and
•
that to be nationally important the community recognition will usually be beyond the 
region or state (note that this is not a requirement, as there may instances where this 
is not the case).
Indicators of aesthetic significance
An indicator of significance defines the grounds on which a place may satisfy the criterion.  
For criterion (e) the indicator is,
Features of beauty or features that inspire, emotionally move or have other characteristics that evoke a 
strong human response.
The guidelines (AHC 2009) provide some notes to help interpret this indicator:
•
aesthetic quality means the particular characteristics of an area that inspire or move 
people;  and
•
aesthetic quality is determined by the response from experiencing the environment or 
particular attributes of that place (primarily visual elements but may also include 
emotional responses, sense of place, sounds, smell or any other factor having a 
strong impact on human thoughts, feelings and attitudes).
A useful definition is,
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
‘Aesthetic value is the response derived from the experience of the environment or of 
particular cultural and natural attributes within it.  This response can be either to the visual or 
to non-visual elements and can embrace emotional response, sense of place, sound, smell and 
any other factor having a strong impact on human thought, feelings and attitudes.’  (Ramsay & 
Paraskevopoulos 1993, p. 79)
Usually multiple sources of data are required as evidence that the experience of a place has 
evoked a response across a community or cultural group, and to demonstrate that the 
response and values are strongly held by that community or cultural group.  Comparisons 
with other similar places are usually required to determine that the place meets ‘a high 
aesthetic ideal’ (AHC 2009, p. 36).
To define whether a place exhibits significant aesthetic values – that is if it ‘exhibits 
outstanding design or aesthetic qualities valued by the community or a cultural group’ – 
the following indicators can be applied:
•
the place or attributes within it creates profound emotional response in communities 
and individuals associated with the place (eg. inspirational, awe inspiring, majestic, 
fearful, peaceful, tranquil, mysterious);
•
the aesthetic response is evidenced in action, creative response or community 
attitudes about the place;  and
•
the place contains outstanding landforms or compositional qualities (eg. 
combinations of colour, form, texture, movement or particular design features) which 
can be identified through community or professional assessment as the source, or 
sources, of aesthetic response.
The assessment should demonstrate the particular aesthetic qualities exhibited by the 
place, and that these particular qualities are valued by a community or cultural group.  
Valued means appreciated, respected, esteemed, treasured, etc.
Other factors may be taken into account including:
•
the strength and nature of aesthetic response;
•
the extent to which the aesthetic response is special or particular to this place;
•
the breadth of the aesthetic response (eg. is the aesthetic response shared across 
individuals and communities, is there consistency in the values held across the range 
of cultural groups?);  and
•
the extent of recognition of the place for its aesthetic characteristics across 
geographic and cultural boundaries.
Other factors which might be considered include longevity of aesthetic response for 
particular communities or cultural groups.
Inspirational landscapes
The Commonwealth Government has undertaken work on the National Heritage theme of 
inspirational landscapes (Sub-Theme 4.7 under Theme 4 - Understanding and Shaping the 
Land) and has defined a series of indicators (Context 2003).  These have now been used in 
other National Heritage assessments.  The inspirational landscapes theme crosses a number 
of the National Heritage criterion, including both social and aesthetic significance.
To date this theme has been mainly used for the assessment of places with potentially 
outstanding natural values, the exception being the assessment of aesthetic values of the 
City of Broken Hill in 2010.

Inspirational landscapes have been defined as:
‘Inspirational landscapes are places that inspire emotional, spiritual and/or intellectual 
responses or actions because of their physical qualities as well as their meanings, associations, 
stories and history’  (Context 2003, p. 15)
Eight indicators were developed to assist in the assessment of Inspirational Landscapes.  
Each is linked to the National Heritage criteria.

Considering Anzac Parade and its possible values, the four indicators relevant to the 
assessment of aesthetic values are:
•
Powerful landscapes – landscapes that create a powerful emotional response usually 
due to their exceptional features.
•
Uncommon landscapes – landscapes with uncommon and unusual qualities within 
an Australian context that have inspired strong emotional responses (as evidenced by 
art, action and visits).
•
Defining images and creative expressions – landscapes that have inspired defining 
images and creative expressions that have shaped national perceptions and 
appreciation of a particular landscape or type of landscape.
•
Contemplative landscapes – natural landscapes that are acknowledged as providing 
important opportunities for contemplation, spiritual reflection or refreshment of the 
human spirit.
A summary of each of these four indicators, including thresholds, measures and evidence, 
can be found in Context (2003).
Terminology
The following terms are used throughout the text related to community-based values.
Community aesthetic values – means aesthetic values that can be demonstrated to be held 
by a defined community or cultural group.  These are distinguished from ‘expert’ or 
professional assessments of aesthetic, technical and design values which are covered 
elsewhere in this plan.
Community – Criteria (e) and (g) refer to ‘community or a cultural group’.  In this plan 
‘community’ is used as short hand to include both communities and cultural groups.
Further, this plan adopts a broad definition of communities and cultural groups as those 
that are defined by shared culture, beliefs, ethnicity, activity or experience.

Associations – means ‘the special connections that exist between people and a place’ 
(Australia ICOMOS 2000, Article 1.15).
Meanings – denotes what a place signifies, indicates, evokes or expresses (Australia 
ICOMOS 2000, Article 1.16).
Identifying and understanding community-based values
A range of methods was used to identify and understand the social and community-held 
aesthetic values of Anzac Parade.  This involved identifying the communities or cultural 
groups with associations with Anzac Parade, and determining how to gain a sound 
appreciation of the values that might arise from those associations within the scope of the 
project.
The methods used and the rationale for selecting these methods are provided below.
Framework
The methods used to understand social and community-held aesthetic values can be 
generally described as ethnographic research, that is qualitative social research that seeks 
to understand a ‘community’ (or society or culture).  In this instance, the research is 
seeking to understand associations and meanings that may be embodied in a place.
The preferred research methods are based on interviews, structured surveys, workshops or 
focus groups, and talking to key informants (eg. interviews with people with special 
knowledge about the place and its associated communities, such as other researchers, 
community leaders, commentators and observers).
By using multiple data sources, information can be compared and contrasted, enabling a 
richer understanding to emerge.  As well, the use of multiple data sources in combination 
(triangulation) increases the reliability of the data although it does not offer a statistically 
validated sample.  Iteration, that is the testing of preliminary ideas through continuing 
‘rounds’ of research is also valuable in increasing the reliability of the results.
These methods were combined with a review of existing studies and other materials, thus 
creating a rich, multi-facetted data set.
Previous research
A key factor in defining the methods to be used was consideration of previous research and 
heritage values assessments.  This research included:
•
Research into community social and aesthetic values for Lake Burley Griffin 
undertaken by Context Pty Ltd for the Lake Burley Griffin Heritage Management 
Plan (Godden Mackay Logan 2009).  The work included an on-line survey, focus 
groups, and analysis of a variety of other datasets.  The research considered the 
values for the Canberra community and the broader Australian community.  The 
project focused on the areas of National Capital Authority responsibility, being the 
lake and lake edge.
•
Research into community social and aesthetic values for the Parliament House Vista 
Area Heritage Management Plan (Marshall and others 2010b).  This assessment 
included an on-line survey, focus group and interviews.
•
National Heritage assessment of the Australian War Memorial and the Memorial 
Parade.  This assessment drew on a number of earlier studies and publications, but

DoSEWPaC advised that no specific research was undertaken into social and 
community-held aesthetic values.  Further, a heritage management plan has now 
been prepared for the Australian War Memorial (Godden Mackay Logan 2011, 
noting this has now been superseded).
•
An Interim Heritage Places Register citation for Anzac Parade and Memorials was 
prepared in 1998 by ACT Heritage.  This assessment draws on a range of published 
sources.
•
Other materials examined included several perception studies, and significant 
publications such Sacred Places (Inglis 2005).

APPENDIX D:  FRAMEWORK FOR ASSESSING HERITAGE 
SIGNIFICANCE
D.1 DEFINITION OF CULTURAL SIGNIFICANCE
For the purposes of this plan, the following definition of cultural significance is used.
Cultural significance means aesthetic, historic, scientific, social or spiritual value for 
past, present or future generations.
Cultural significance is embodied in the place itself, its fabric, setting, use, 
associations, meanings, records, related places and related objects.
Places may have a range of values for different individuals or groups. (Australia 
ICOMOS 2013, Article 1.2)
The heritage value of a place includes the place’s natural and cultural environment 
having aesthetic, historic, scientific or social significance, or other significance, for 
current and future generations of Australians.  (Subsection 3(2) of the Australian 
Heritage Council Act 2003;  Section 528 of the Environment Protection and 
Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999)
D.2 NATIONAL HERITAGE CRITERIA
The National Heritage criteria for a place are any or all of the following:
(a)
the place has outstanding heritage value to the nation because of the place’s 
importance in the course, or pattern, of Australia’s natural or cultural history;
(b)
the place has outstanding heritage value to the nation because of the place’s 
possession of uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of Australia’s natural or 
cultural history;
(c)
the place has outstanding heritage value to the nation because of the place’s potential 
to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of Australia’s natural or 
cultural history;
(d)
the place has outstanding heritage value to the nation because of the place’s 
importance in demonstrating the principal characteristics of:
(i)
a class of Australia’s natural or cultural places; or
(ii)
a class of Australia’s natural or cultural environments;
(e)
the place has outstanding heritage value to the nation because of the place’s 
importance in exhibiting particular aesthetic characteristics valued by a community 
or cultural group;
(f)
the place has outstanding heritage value to the nation because of the place’s 
importance in demonstrating a high degree of creative or technical achievement at a

particular period;
(g)
the place has outstanding heritage value to the nation because of the place’s strong or 
special association with a particular community or cultural group for social, cultural 
or spiritual reasons;
(h)
the place has outstanding heritage value to the nation because of the place’s special 
association with the life or works of a person, or group of persons, of importance in 
Australia’s natural or cultural history;
(i)
the place has outstanding heritage value to the nation because of the place’s 
importance as part of indigenous tradition.
The cultural aspect of a criterion means the indigenous cultural aspect, the non-indigenous 
cultural aspect, or both.  (Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation 
Amendment Regulations 2003 (No. 1), Section 10.01A)

APPENDIX F:  BURRA CHARTER
The Burra Charter
The Australia ICOMOS Charter for Places of Cultural Significance
Australia ICOMOS Incorporated International Council on Monuments and Sites
2013
ICOMOS
ICOMOS (International Council on Monuments and Sites) is a non-governmental professional organisation 
formed in 1965, with headquarters in Paris.  ICOMOS is primarily concerned with the philosophy, 
terminology, methodology and techniques of cultural heritage conservation.  It is closely linked to UNESCO, 
particularly in its role under the World Heritage Convention 1972 as UNESCO’s principal adviser on cultural 
matters related to World Heritage.  The 11,000 members of ICOMOS include architects, town planners, 
demographers, archaeologists, geographers, historians, conservators, anthropologists, scientists, engineers 
and heritage administrators.  Members in the 103 countries belonging to ICOMOS are formed into National 
Committees and participate in a range of conservation projects, research work, intercultural exchanges and 
cooperative activities.  ICOMOS also has 27 International Scientific Committees that focus on particular 
aspects of the conservation field.  ICOMOS members meet triennially in a General Assembly.
Australia ICOMOS
The Australian National Committee of ICOMOS (Australia ICOMOS) was formed in 1976.  It elects an 
Executive Committee of 15 members, which is responsible for carrying out national programs and 
participating in decisions of ICOMOS as an international organisation.  It provides expert advice as required 
by ICOMOS, especially in its relationship with the World Heritage Committee.  Australia ICOMOS acts as a 
national and international link between public authorities, institutions and individuals involved in the study 
and conservation of all places of cultural significance.  Australia ICOMOS members participate in a range of 
conservation activities including site visits, training, conferences and meetings.
Revision of the Burra Charter
The Burra Charter was first adopted in 1979 at the historic South Australian mining town of Burra.  Minor 
revisions were made in 1981 and 1988, with more substantial changes in 1999.
Following a review this version was adopted by Australia ICOMOS in October 2013.
The review process included replacement of the 1988 Guidelines to the Burra Charter with Practice Notes 
which are available at: australia.icomos.org
Australia ICOMOS documents are periodically reviewed and we welcome any comments.

The Burra Charter
(The Australia ICOMOS Charter for Places of Cultural Significance, 2013)
Preamble
Considering the International Charter for the Conservation and Restoration of Monuments and Sites (Venice 
1964), and the Resolutions of the 5th General Assembly of the International Council on Monuments and 
Sites (ICOMOS) (Moscow 1978), the Burra Charter was adopted by Australia ICOMOS (the Australian 
National Committee of ICOMOS) on 19 August 1979 at Burra, South Australia.  Revisions were adopted on 
23 February 1981, 23 April 1988, 26 November 1999 and 31 October 2013.
The Burra Charter provides guidance for the conservation and management of places of cultural significance 
(cultural heritage places), and is based on the knowledge and experience of Australia ICOMOS members.
Conservation is an integral part of the management of places of cultural significance and is an ongoing 
responsibility.
Who is the Charter for?
The Charter sets a standard of practice for those who provide advice, make decisions about, or undertake 
works to places of cultural significance, including owners, managers and custodians.
Using the Charter
The Charter should be read as a whole.  Many articles are interdependent.
The Charter consists of:
•
Definitions
Article 1
•
Conservation Principles
Articles 2–13
•
Conservation Processes
Articles 14–25
•
Conservation Practices
Articles 26–34
•
The Burra Charter Process flow chart.
The key concepts are included in the Conservation Principles section and these are further developed in the 
Conservation Processes and Conservation Practice sections.  The flow chart explains the Burra Charter 
Process (Article 6) and is an integral part of the Charter.  Explanatory Notes also form part of the Charter.
The Charter is self-contained, but aspects of its use and application are further explained, in a series of 
Australia ICOMOS Practice Notes, in The Illustrated Burra Charter, and in other guiding documents 
available from the Australia ICOMOS web site: australia.icomos.org.
What places does the Charter apply to?
The Charter can be applied to all types of places of cultural significance including natural, Indigenous and 
historic places with cultural values.
The standards of other organisations may also be relevant.  These include the Australian Natural Heritage 
Charter, Ask First: a guide to respecting Indigenous heritage places and values and Significance 2.0: a guide 
to assessing the significance of collections.
National and international charters and other doctrine may be relevant.  See australia.icomos.org.

Why conserve?
Places of cultural significance enrich people’s lives, often providing a deep and inspirational sense of 
connection to community and landscape, to the past and to lived experiences.  They are historical records, 
that are important expressions of Australian identity and experience.  Places of cultural significance reflect 
the diversity of our communities, telling us about who we are and the past that has formed us and the 
Australian landscape.  They are irreplaceable and precious.
These places of cultural significance must be conserved for present and future generations in accordance with 
the principle of inter-generational equity.
The Burra Charter advocates a cautious approach to change: do as much as necessary to care for the place 
and to make it useable, but otherwise change it as little as possible so that its cultural significance is retained.
Articles
Explanatory Notes
Article 1.  Definitions
For the purposes of this Charter:
1.1
Place means a geographically defined area.  It may 
include elements, objects, spaces and views.  Place may have 
tangible and intangible dimensions.
Place has a broad scope and 
includes natural and cultural 
features.  Place can be large or 
small: for example, a memorial, a 
tree, an individual building or 
group of buildings, the location of 
an historical event, an urban area or 
town, a cultural landscape, a 
garden, an industrial plant, a 
shipwreck, a site with in situ 
remains, a stone arrangement, a 
road or travel route, a community 
meeting place, a site with spiritual 
or religious connections.
1.2
Cultural significance means aesthetic, historic, scientific, 
social or spiritual value for past, present or future generations.
Cultural significance is embodied in the place itself, its fabric, 
setting, use, associations, meanings, records, related places and 
related objects.
Places may have a range of values for different individuals or 
groups.
The term cultural significance is 
synonymous with cultural heritage 
significance and cultural heritage 
value.
Cultural significance may change 
over time and with use.
Understanding of cultural 
significance may change as a result 
of new information.
1.3
Fabric means all the physical material of the place 
including elements, fixtures, contents and objects.
Fabric includes building interiors 
and sub-surface remains, as well as 
excavated material.
Natural elements of a place may 
also constitute fabric.  For example 
the rocks that signify a Dreaming 
place.
Fabric may define spaces and 
views and these may be part of the 
significance of the place.
1.4
Conservation means all the processes of looking after a 
place so as to retain its cultural significance.
See also Article 14.
1.5
Maintenance means the continuous protective care of a 
place, and its setting.
Maintenance is to be distinguished from repair which involves 
restoration or reconstruction.
Examples of protective care 
include:
•
maintenance — regular 
inspection and cleaning of a 
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

Explanatory Notes
place, e.g. mowing and 
pruning in a garden;
•
repair involving restoration 
— returning dislodged or 
relocated fabric to its 
original location e.g. loose 
roof gutters on a building or 
displaced rocks in a stone 
bora ring; 
•
repair involving 
reconstruction — replacing 
decayed fabric with new 
fabric
It is recognised that all places and 
their elements change over time at 
varying rates.
1.6
Preservation means maintaining a place in its existing 
state and retarding deterioration.
1.7
Restoration means returning a place to a known earlier 
state by removing accretions or by reassembling existing elements 
without the introduction of new material.
1.8
Reconstruction means returning a place to a known 
earlier state and is distinguished from restoration by the 
introduction of new material.
New material may include recycled 
material salvaged from other 
places.  This should not be to the 
detriment of any place of cultural 
significance.
1.9
Adaptation means changing a place to suit the existing 
use or a proposed use.
1.10
Use means the functions of a place, including the 
activities and traditional and customary practices that may occur at 
the place or are dependent on the place.
Use includes for example cultural 
practices commonly associated 
with Indigenous peoples such as 
ceremonies, hunting and fishing, 
and fulfillment of traditional 
obligations.  Exercising a right of 
access may be a use.
1.11
Compatible use means a use which respects the cultural 
significance of a place.  Such a use involves no, or minimal, 
impact on cultural significance.
1.12
Setting means the immediate and extended environment 
of a place that is part of or contributes to its cultural significance 
and distinctive character.
Setting may include: structures, 
spaces, land, water and sky; the 
visual setting including views to 
and from the place, and along a 
cultural route; and other sensory 
aspects of the setting such as 
smells and sounds.  Setting may 
also include historical and 
contemporary relationships, such 
as use and activities, social and 
spiritual practices, and 
relationships with other places, 
both tangible and intangible.
1.13
Related place means a place that contributes to the 
cultural significance of another place.
1.14
Related object means an object that contributes to the 
cultural significance of a place but is not at the place.
Objects at a place are encompassed 
by the definition of place, and may 
or may not contribute to its cultural 
significance.
1.15
Associations mean the connections that exist between 
people and a place.
Associations may include social or 
spiritual values and cultural 
responsibilities for a place.

Explanatory Notes
1.16
Meanings denote what a place signifies, indicates, evokes 
or expresses to people.
Meanings generally relate to 
intangible dimensions such as 
symbolic qualities and memories.
1.17
Interpretation means all the ways of presenting the 
cultural significance of a place.
Interpretation may be a 
combination of the treatment of the 
fabric (e.g. maintenance, 
restoration, reconstruction); the use 
of and activities at the place; and 
the use of introduced explanatory 
material.
Conservation Principles
Article 2.  Conservation and management
2.1
Places of cultural significance should be conserved.
2.2
The aim of conservation is to retain the cultural 
significance of a place.
2.3
Conservation is an integral part of good management of 
places of cultural significance.
2.4
Places of cultural significance should be safeguarded and 
not put at risk or left in a vulnerable state.
Article 3.  Cautious approach
3.1
Conservation is based on a respect for the existing fabric, 
use, associations and meanings.  It requires a cautious approach of 
changing as much as necessary but as little as possible.
The traces of additions, alterations 
and earlier treatments to the fabric 
of a place are evidence of its 
history and uses which may be part 
of its significance.  Conservation 
action should assist and not impede 
their understanding.
3.2
Changes to a place should not distort the physical or other 
evidence it provides, nor be based on conjecture.
Article 4.  Knowledge, skills and techniques
4.1
Conservation should make use of all the knowledge, 
skills and disciplines which can contribute to the study and care of 
the place.
4.2
Traditional techniques and materials are preferred for the 
conservation of significant fabric.  In some circumstances modern 
techniques and materials which offer substantial conservation 
benefits may be appropriate.
The use of modern materials and 
techniques must be supported by 
firm scientific evidence or by a 
body of experience.
Article 5.  Values
5.1
Conservation of a place should identify and take into 
consideration all aspects of cultural and natural significance 
without unwarranted emphasis on any one value at the expense of 
others.
Conservation of places with natural 
significance is explained in the 
Australian Natural Heritage 
Charter.  This Charter defines 
natural significance to mean the 
importance of ecosystems, 
biodiversity and geodiversity for 
their existence value or for present 
or future generations, in terms of 
their scientific, social, aesthetic and 
life-support value.
In some cultures, natural and 
cultural values are indivisible.
5.2
Relative degrees of cultural significance may lead to 
different conservation actions at a place.
A cautious approach is needed, as 
understanding of cultural 
significance may change.  This 
article should not be used to justify

Explanatory Notes
actions which do not retain cultural 
significance.
Article 6.  Burra Charter Process
6.1
The cultural significance of a place and other issues 
affecting its future are best understood by a sequence of collecting 
and analysing information before making decisions.  
Understanding cultural significance comes first, then development 
of policy and finally management of the place in accordance with 
the policy.  This is the Burra Charter Process.
The Burra Charter Process, or 
sequence of investigations, 
decisions and actions, is illustrated 
below and in more detail in the 
accompanying flow chart which 
forms part of the Charter.
Understand Significance

Develop Policy

Manage in Accordance with Policy
6.2
Policy for managing a place must be based on an 
understanding of its cultural significance.
6.3
Policy development should also include consideration of 
other factors affecting the future of a place such as the owner’s 
needs, resources, external constraints and its physical condition.
6.4
In developing an effective policy, different ways to retain 
cultural significance and address other factors may need to be 
explored.
Options considered may include a 
range of uses and changes (e.g. 
adaptation) to a place.
6.5
Changes in circumstances, or new information or 
perspectives, may require reiteration of part or all of the Burra 
Charter Process.
Article 7.  Use
7.1
Where the use of a place is of cultural significance it 
should be retained.
7.2
A place should have a compatible use.
The policy should identify a use or 
combination of uses or constraints 
on uses that retain the cultural 
significance of the place.  New use 
of a place should involve minimal 
change to significant fabric and 
use; should respect associations 
and meanings; and where 
appropriate should provide for 
continuation of activities and 
practices which contribute to the 
cultural significance of the place.
Article 8.  Setting
Conservation requires the retention of an appropriate setting.  This 
includes retention of the visual and sensory setting, as well as the 
retention of spiritual and other cultural relationships that contribute 
to the cultural significance of the place.
Setting is explained in Article 1.12.
New construction, demolition, intrusions or other changes which 
would adversely affect the setting or relationships are not 
appropriate.
Article 9.  Location
9.1
The physical location of a place is part of its cultural 
significance.  A building, work or other element of a place should 
remain in its historical location.  Relocation is generally 
unacceptable unless this is the sole practical means of ensuring its 
survival.
9.2
Some buildings, works or other elements of places were 
designed to be readily removable or already have a history of 
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan

Explanatory Notes
relocation.  Provided such buildings, works or other elements do 
not have significant links with their present location, removal may 
be appropriate.
9.3
If any building, work or other element is moved, it should 
be moved to an appropriate location and given an appropriate use.  
Such action should not be to the detriment of any place of cultural 
significance.
Article 10.  Contents
Contents, fixtures and objects which contribute to the cultural 
significance of a place should be retained at that place.  Their 
removal is unacceptable unless it is: the sole means of ensuring 
their security and preservation; on a temporary basis for treatment 
or exhibition; for cultural reasons; for health and safety; or to 
protect the place.  Such contents, fixtures and objects should be 
returned where circumstances permit and it is culturally 
appropriate.
For example, the repatriation 
(returning) of an object or element 
to a place may be important to 
Indigenous cultures, and may be 
essential to the retention of its 
cultural significance.
Article 28 covers the circumstances 
where significant fabric might be 
disturbed, for example, during 
archaeological excavation.
Article 33 deals with significant 
fabric that has been removed from 
a place.
Article 11.  Related places and objects
The contribution which related places and related objects make to 
the cultural significance of the place should be retained.
Article 12.  Participation
Conservation, interpretation and management of a place should 
provide for the participation of people for whom the place has 
significant associations and meanings, or who have social, 
spiritual or other cultural responsibilities for the place.
Article 13.  Co-existence of cultural values
Co-existence of cultural values should always be recognised, 
respected and encouraged.  This is especially important in cases 
where they conflict.
For some places, conflicting 
cultural values may affect policy 
development and management 
decisions.  In Article 13, the term 
cultural values refers to those 
beliefs which are important to a 
cultural group, including but not 
limited to political, religious, 
spiritual and moral beliefs.  This is 
broader than values associated with 
cultural significance.
Conservation Processes
Article 14.  Conservation processes
Conservation may, according to circumstance, include the 
processes of: retention or reintroduction of a use; retention of 
associations and meanings; maintenance, preservation, 
restoration, reconstruction, adaptation and interpretation; and will 
commonly include a combination of more than one of these.  
Conservation may also include retention of the contribution that 
related places and related objects make to the cultural 
significance of a place.
Conservation normally seeks to 
slow deterioration unless the 
significance of the place dictates 
otherwise.  There may be 
circumstances where no action is 
required to achieve conservation.
Article 15.  Change

Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
Articles
Explanatory Notes
15.1
Change may be necessary to retain cultural significance, 
but is undesirable where it reduces cultural significance.  The 
amount of change to a place and its use should be guided by the 
cultural significance of the place and its appropriate 
interpretation.
When change is being considered, 
including for a temporary use, a 
range of options should be 
explored to seek the option which 
minimises any reduction to its 
cultural significance.
It may be appropriate to change a 
place where this reflects a change 
in cultural meanings or practices at 
the place, but the significance of 
the place should always be 
respected.
Reversible changes should be 
considered temporary.  Non-
reversible change should only be 
used as a last resort and should not 
prevent future conservation action.
15.2
Changes which reduce cultural significance should be 
reversible, and be reversed when circumstances permit.
15.3
Demolition of significant fabric of a place is generally 
not acceptable.  However, in some cases minor demolition may be 
appropriate as part of conservation.  Removed significant fabric 
should be reinstated when circumstances permit.
15.4
The contributions of all aspects of cultural significance of 
a place should be respected.  If a place includes fabric, uses, 
associations or meanings of different periods, or different aspects 
of cultural significance, emphasising or interpreting one period or 
aspect at the expense of another can only be justified when what is 
left out, removed or diminished is of slight cultural significance 
and that which is emphasised or interpreted is of much greater 
cultural significance.
Article 16.  Maintenance
Maintenance is fundamental to conservation.  Maintenance should 
be undertaken where fabric is of cultural significance and its 
maintenance is necessary to retain that cultural significance.
Maintaining a place may be 
important to the fulfilment of 
traditional laws and customs in 
some Indigenous communities and 
other cultural groups.
Article 17.  Preservation
Preservation is appropriate where the existing fabric or its 
condition constitutes evidence of cultural significance, or where 
insufficient evidence is available to allow other conservation 
processes to be carried out.
Preservation protects fabric 
without obscuring evidence of its 
construction and use.  The process 
should always be applied:
•
where the evidence of the 
fabric is of such 
significance that it should 
not be altered; or
•
where insufficient 
investigation has been 
carried out to permit policy 
decisions to be taken in 
accord with Articles 26 to 
28.
New work (e.g. stabilisation) may 
be carried out in association with 
preservation when its purpose is 
the physical protection of the fabric

Explanatory Notes
and when it is consistent with 
Article 22.
Article 18.  Restoration and reconstruction
Restoration and reconstruction should reveal culturally significant 
aspects of the place.
Article 19.  Restoration
Restoration is appropriate only if there is sufficient evidence of an 
earlier state of the fabric.
Article 20.  Reconstruction
20.1
Reconstruction is appropriate only where a place is 
incomplete through damage or alteration, and only where there is 
sufficient evidence to reproduce an earlier state of the fabric.  In 
some cases, reconstruction may also be appropriate as part of a use 
or practice that retains the cultural significance of the place.
Places with social or spiritual value 
may warrant reconstruction, even 
though very little may remain (e.g. 
only building footings or tree 
stumps following fire, flood or 
storm).  The requirement for 
sufficient evidence to reproduce an 
earlier state still applies.
20.2
Reconstruction should be identifiable on close inspection 
or through additional interpretation.
Article 21.  Adaptation
21.1
Adaptation is acceptable only where the adaptation has 
minimal impact on the cultural significance of the place.
Adaptation may involve additions 
to the place, the introduction of 
new services, or a new use, or 
changes to safeguard the place.  
Adaptation of a place for a new use 
is often referred to as ‘adaptive re-
use’ and should be consistent with 
Article 7.2.
21.2
Adaptation should involve minimal change to significant 
fabric, achieved only after considering alternatives.
Article 22.  New work
22.1
New work such as additions or other changes to the place 
may be acceptable where it respects and does not distort or 
obscure the cultural significance of the place, or detract from its 
interpretation and appreciation.
New work should respect the 
significance of a place through 
consideration of its siting, bulk, 
form, scale, character, colour, 
texture and material.  Imitation 
should generally be avoided.
22.2
New work should be readily identifiable as such, but must 
respect and have minimal impact on the cultural significance of 
the place.
New work should be consistent 
with Articles 3, 5, 8, 15, 21 and 
22.1.
Article 23.  Retaining or reintroducing use
Retaining, modifying or reintroducing a significant use may be 
appropriate and preferred forms of conservation.
These may require changes to 
significant fabric but they should 
be minimised.  In some cases, 
continuing a significant use, 
activity or practice may involve 
substantial new work.
Article 24.  Retaining associations and meanings
24.1
Significant associations between people and a place 
should be respected, retained and not obscured.  Opportunities for 
the interpretation, commemoration and celebration of these 
associations should be investigated and implemented.
For many places associations will 
be linked to aspects of use, 
including activities and practices.

Explanatory Notes
Some associations and meanings 
may not be apparent and will 
require research.
24.2
Significant meanings, including spiritual values, of a 
place should be respected.  Opportunities for the continuation or 
revival of these meanings should be investigated and implemented.
Article 25.  Interpretation
The cultural significance of many places is not readily apparent, 
and should be explained by interpretation.  Interpretation should 
enhance understanding and engagement, and be culturally 
appropriate.
In some circumstances any form of 
interpretation may be culturally 
inappropriate.
Conservation Practice
Article 26.  Applying the Burra Charter Process
26.1
Work on a place should be preceded by studies to 
understand the place which should include analysis of physical, 
documentary, oral and other evidence, drawing on appropriate 
knowledge, skills and disciplines.
The results of studies should be 
kept up to date, regularly reviewed 
and revised as necessary.
26.2
Written statements of cultural significance and policy for 
the place should be prepared, justified and accompanied by 
supporting evidence.  The statements of significance and policy 
should be incorporated into a management plan for the place.
Policy should address all relevant 
issues, e.g. use, interpretation, 
management and change.
A management plan is a useful 
document for recording the Burra 
Charter Process, i.e.  the steps in 
planning for and managing a place 
of cultural significance (Article 6.1 
and flow chart).  Such plans are 
often called conservation 
management plans and sometimes 
have other names.
The management plan may deal 
with other matters related to the 
management of the place.
26.3
Groups and individuals with associations with the place 
as well as those involved in its management should be provided 
with opportunities to contribute to and participate in identifying 
and understanding the cultural significance of the place.  Where 
appropriate they should also have opportunities to participate in its 
conservation and management.
26.4
Statements of cultural significance and policy for the 
place should be periodically reviewed, and actions and their 
consequences monitored to ensure continuing appropriateness and 
effectiveness.
Monitor actions taken in case there 
are also unintended consequences.
Article 27.  Managing change
27.1
The impact of proposed changes, including incremental 
changes, on the cultural significance of a place should be assessed 
with reference to the statement of significance and the policy for 
managing the place.  It may be necessary to modify proposed 
changes to better retain cultural significance.
27.2
Existing fabric, use, associations and meanings should be 
adequately recorded before and after any changes are made to the 
place.
Article 28.  Disturbance of fabric
28.1
Disturbance of significant fabric for study, or to obtain 
evidence, should be minimised.  Study of a place by any 
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

Articles
Explanatory Notes
disturbance of the fabric, including archaeological excavation, 
should only be undertaken to provide data essential for decisions 
on the conservation of the place, or to obtain important evidence 
about to be lost or made inaccessible.
28.2
Investigation of a place which requires disturbance of the 
fabric, apart from that necessary to make decisions, may be 
appropriate provided that it is consistent with the policy for the 
place.  Such investigation should be based on important research 
questions which have potential to substantially add to knowledge, 
which cannot be answered in other ways and which minimises 
disturbance of significant fabric.
Article 29.  Responsibility
The organisations and individuals responsible for management and 
decisions should be named and specific responsibility taken for 
each decision.
Article 30.  Direction, supervision and implementation
Competent direction and supervision should be maintained at all 
stages, and any changes should be implemented by people with 
appropriate knowledge and skills.
Article 31.  Keeping a log
New evidence may come to light while implementing policy or a 
plan for a place.  Other factors may arise and require new 
decisions.  A log of new evidence and additional decisions should 
be kept.
New decisions should respect and 
have minimal impact on the 
cultural significance of the place.
Article 32.  Records
32.1
The records associated with the conservation of a place 
should be placed in a permanent archive and made publicly 
available, subject to requirements of security and privacy, and 
where this is culturally appropriate.
32.2
Records about the history of a place should be protected 
and made publicly available, subject to requirements of security 
and privacy, and where this is culturally appropriate.
Article 33.  Removed fabric
Significant fabric which has been removed from a place including 
contents, fixtures and objects, should be catalogued, and protected 
in accordance with its cultural significance.
Where possible and culturally appropriate, removed significant 
fabric including contents, fixtures and objects, should be kept at 
the place.
Article 34.  Resources
Adequate resources should be provided for conservation.
The best conservation often 
involves the least work and can be 
inexpensive.

APPENDIX H:  MANAGEMENT PLAN REVIEW
REVIEW OF THE 2013 HERITAGE MANAGEMENT PLAN
The EPBC Act specifies several matters to be addressed within the review of a plan under 
section 324W.  In addition, the Department of Agriculture, Water and the Environment has 
identified several additional matters to be addressed in the case of Commonwealth Heritage 
plans (Department of the Environment and Heritage 2006, pp. 13-14).  The latter also seem 
sensible to address in this case, regarding a National Heritage plan.  Accordingly, the 
following review addresses both the statutory requirements for National Heritage plans, as 
well as the additional matters identified by the Department for Commonwealth Heritage 
plans.
Who would carry out the review and the procedures to be used
The review was carried out by the consultants for the plan update project, Duncan Marshall 
and Amanda Evans.  The tasks undertaken in the review and overall update of the plan 
included the following:
•
general review of the text to ensure it reads well and is an integrated document to 
address EPBC Act and NCA requirements;
•
generally address and integrate the National Heritage and Commonwealth Heritage 
values of the place in the plan.  Since the preparation of the 2013 plan, DoE has 
required the faithful inclusion of all National Heritage and Commonwealth Heritage 
values even if the research for the plan did not actually support them;
•
general update of figures and images (eg. up to date images/pictures should be used in 
the descriptive sections);
•
consider the relationship of this plan with other plans (ie. for the Parliament House 
Vista and Australian War Memorial), including those to be updated, depending on if 
they are finished/available.  The aim being to achieve compatibility/integration;
•
revise Chapter 1 to address the conduct of the current project and project limitations;
•
general check/update of description and condition, including condition and integrity 
issues (Sections 2.2 and 8.5) – because of changes since the original plan was 
completed.  This included a discussion of impacts as a result of changes, but such 
discussion is not a full heritage impact assessment.  This also entailed a site inspection;
•
update overview history with events after the original plan was completed (Chapter 3);
•
revise significance in the light of new evidence, if any, and analysis, if needed 
(Chapters 6 and 7);
•
revise significance to address any differences between the plan and the National 
Heritage and Commonwealth Heritage values (Chapters 6 and 7).  This task is related to 
the task above about integrating such values into the plan;
•
check/update National Capital Plan requirements (Section 8.2 and Appendix E);
•
stakeholders – check if any new stakeholders to consider/or stakeholder views to 
update, and consult as needed (Section 8.3);
•
update NCA aspirations at Section 8.4 – given passage of time, including meetings with 
NCA business areas;
•
update management issues (Section 8.4);
Replaced Authorised Version registered 18/04/2024 F2024L00408

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Anzac Parade Heritage Management Plan
uPage 
•
review policies – especially identify any specific issues requiring specific policy 
guidance and include such guidance (Chapter 9) – partly because of passage of 
time/partly because of experience in using the plan over the years;
•
update priority works (Appendix F) – given passage of time, etc;  and
•
update with latest version (2013) of Burra Charter (Appendix H).
In undertaking this review and update work, as noted, consultations were also held with key 
NCA staff responsible for management of the place, in part to ascertain the effectiveness of 
the 2013 plan and any issues to be addressed in the update work.  Site inspections were 
another important aspect of the review.
A workshop was also held with key NCA staff to generally discuss heritage management 
plans.  The workshop sought to consider whether plans were effective for the NCA, what 
aspects of plans worked well, and what aspects were problematic.  Relevant workshop 
outcomes are integrated with the text below.
An assessment of whether the plan addresses the matters prescribed in the regulations 
including being consistent with the National Heritage management principles
The 2013 plan addressed matters prescribed in the regulations including the National 
Heritage management principles, and the plan is consistent with the principles.  This was 
confirmed in the summary at Appendix H of the 2013 plan.
An assessment of the effectiveness of the plan in protecting and conserving the National 
Heritage values
In general terms, the plan has been effective in protecting the National Heritage values of 
Anzac Parade.  The major issues or changes affecting the place include the following:
•
installation of two new memorials within memorial niches along the Parade, achieved 
within the guidance provided by the plan;
•
ongoing management of the major tree plantings, including coring, composting and 
mulching the plantations which has improved the health of trees, as well as selective 
replacements where possible;
•
the poor health/performance of the Hebe ‘Otari delight’ in the central beds of the 
Parade.  Research into the reasons for these problems has been commissioned by the 
NCA, and will inform the future of the plantings – whether Hebe ‘Otari delight’ can be 
successful in future and under what management regime;  and
•
developments within the setting of the Parade, notably large residential development to 
the east in Campbell, and the demolition of Anzac Park East which is to be replaced 
with a new building.  At some stage, it is anticipated Anzac Park West will also be 
demolished.
In summary, the values have generally been conserved.  The memorials appear in generally 
fair to good condition, the condition of the trees has improved although the hebes have 
declined.  The overall level of maintenance could still be improved.  There are no significant 
threats within the property although the large residential developments to the east and outside 
of the place are somewhat intrusive.  The impact of the replacement of Anzac Park East is not 
yet clear.

was the complexity of plans and the difficulty of finding information.  This comment could 
apply to the Anzac Parade plan as well.
Recommendations for the improved protection of values
The improved protection of heritage values is achieved through the revised and updated 
heritage management plan with:
•
an updated understanding of condition and management issues, including issues related 
to the Hebe ‘Otari delight’ and developments within the setting;  and
•
an improved suite of conservation policies and strategies (Section 6.3), including to 
address the issues with Hebe ‘Otari delight’ and developments within the setting.
One specific recommendation/strategy is for one or several landscape maintenance plans to 
provide detailed implementation guidance.
The heritage management plan workshop with key NCA staff also raised a number of general 
issues to be further considered.  These include:
•
improving the process for undertaking works and the need to ensure heritage issues are 
identified, including values;
•
linking the plan to the NCA asset management system;
•
standardising the layout of plans;
•
improving the accessibility of plan guidance (eg. policies) for key audiences, including 
NCA staff and contractors;  and
•
the possibility of training for key audiences, including NCA staff and contractors.
Outline how new and changed information that may have come through monitoring, 
community input and further research will be incorporated into the revised 
management plan
As noted above, new and changed information and analysis has informed the update of the 
plan in sections such as the history, description, condition, analysis of values, statement of 
significance, and policies and strategies.
As examples, issues regarding the Hebe ‘Otari delight’ and developments within the setting 
have been identified through either ongoing NCA management or the plan update process, 
these are documented in the plan, and policies and strategies have been revised or developed 
to address them.
Details of any significant damage or threat to the heritage values
There are currently several threats to the heritage values of the Parade.
Hebe plantings
A threat to significance arises in relation to the poor health/performance of the Hebe ‘Otari 
delight’ in the central beds of the Parade.
The central planter beds play a significant role in the meaning, formality and overall 
appreciation of this heritage landscape.  They are one of the most noticeable elements within 
the Parade as seen from Mount Ainslie and the Parliament House Vista.  Apart from their 
symbolic role, they act as a visual link to the green landscape beyond.

A separate review of the Hebes has identified several soil-borne diseases and other 
contributing factors as the causes of the poor performance.  This review will also provide 
recommendations to remedy the problems.
New developments in the broader setting
There is an urgent need to address the impact of the large development to the east in 
Campbell where the buildings are dominating views of several individual memorials from 
within the Parade.  This issue has partly been anticipated in the National Capital Plan.
Another issue is the future replacement of the Anzac Park East and West buildings, and the 
need to preserve the portal effect.
Eucalyptus bicostata plantations
The tree plantations have undergone significant restoration and replenishment in 2014 with 
excellent results.  However, given the cultivation history of this species in the ACT, more 
serious tree problems can probably be expected over the next 10-20 years.
Currently, individual trees are being replaced successfully to have minimal impact on the 
overall landscape.  Should this become an accelerated problem where numerous groups of 
trees senesce at the same time over the next five years, then a more formal strategy will need 
to be designed so work programs can gradually be implemented to reconstruct the plantations 
without too much disturbance to the Parade landscape.
