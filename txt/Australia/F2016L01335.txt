Establishment 
For the purposes of paragraph 78(1)(a) of the PGPA Act, a special account is established 
with the name Art Rental Special Account 2016 (the special account).

Credits to the special account 
For the purposes of paragraph 78(1)(b) of the PGPA Act, amounts equal to the following

(a) an amount received in the course of the performance of functions that relate to the 
purposes of the special account;

(c) amounts debited from the Art Rental Special Account, established by the Financial 
Management and Accountability Determination 2006/18 — Art Rental Special Account 
Establishment 2006. 
Note 1: The Appropriation Acts may provide that if any of the purposes of a special account are covered by 
an item in an Appropriation Act (whether or not the item refers to the special account), then amounts 
may be debited against the appropriation for that item and credited to the special account. 
Note 2: Where an amount equal to an amount debited from the special account is repaid to the Commonwealth, 
the amount may be credited to the special account under paragraph 74(1)(b) of the PGPA Act and 
subsection 27(5) of the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Rule 2014.

Purposes of the special account 
For the purposes of paragraph 78(1)(c) of the PGPA Act, amounts standing to the credit of 
the special account are allowed to be debited for the following purposes: 
(a) to make payments to acquire, deaccession, lease, promote, develop, exhibit, lend, 
conserve and undertake any other activities in relation to managing an art rental 
collection for the Commonwealth; 
(b) to make payments for activities incidental to the purpose mentioned in paragraph (a), 
including direct and indirect costs of administering the special account;  
(c) to reduce the balance of the special account (and, therefore, the available 
appropriation) without making a real or notional payment; 
(d) to repay, as required by law, amounts that have been credited to the special account. 
Note 1: Subsection 78(4) of the PGPA Act appropriates the Consolidated Revenue Fund for expenditure for 
the purposes of the special account, up to the balance of the special account at the time of payment. 
Note 2: An amount may be debited from the special account:

with direct and indirect costs in relation to administering the special account; or 
(b)  for the purpose of paragraph 7(c), to allow for the balance of the special account to be reduced, 
with no payment or credit available to another party, account or appropriation; or 
(c)  where that amount has been incorrectly credited by virtue of a clerical mistake or exercise of a 
discretion based on a fundamental mistake of fact or law (legal advice on the mistaken fact or 
law should be obtained before an amount is debited on this basis).

Accountable authority 
For the purposes of paragraph 78(1)(d) of the PGPA Act, the accountable authority
