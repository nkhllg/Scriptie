51  Amount of incentive and reductions by Secretary
(1) The amount of an incentive for an NRAS year, for a rental dwelling covered by 
an allocation, is the full amount of incentive for the dwelling for the year reduced 
(as necessary) by the Secretary in accordance with this section.
Note:
This amount of incentive may sometimes be apportioned between 2 or more approved 
participants (see section 53).
Reducing incentives
(2) The Secretary must reduce the full amount of the incentive if the Secretary is 
satisfied that, for one or more days during the NRAS year:
(a) the incentive was not available; or
(b) circumstances specified in a condition of the allocation have not happened.
Note:
Division 2 of Part 2 sets out some of the circumstances when the incentive will not be 
available.
(3) The reduced amount of the incentive must be worked out by apportioning the full 
amount by reference to the number of days in the NRAS year not covered by 
subsection (2).
(4) To avoid doubt, one or more reductions made by the Secretary under this section 
may reduce the amount of the incentive to nil.
Internal review

incentive, the Secretary must give the approved participant for the allocation 
concerned written notice of the decision.
(6) The following may apply to the Secretary for review of the decision:

(b) if the allocation is transferred to another person within the period that 
applies under paragraph (7)(b)—the gaining approved participant.

55  Elections by endorsed charitable institutions
(1) This section applies if an approved participant is an endorsed charitable 
institution.
(2) The approved participant may elect to receive the incentive to which the 
approved participant is entitled for NRAS years as a tax offset certificate rather 
than as a payment.
(3) Unless it is withdrawn, an election applies for the purposes of all following 
NRAS years.

is made before the end of 31 December in that NRAS year.

approved participant must, within 28 days, notify the Secretary of the cessation.
56  Variation of incentive amount
(1) The Secretary may determine that the amount of an incentive for an NRAS year 
is incorrect if the Secretary is satisfied that:
(a) an error has been made in calculating or providing the amount; or
(b) the amount was calculated based on information that was false or 
misleading.
Note:
A decision under this subsection is reviewable by the Administrative Review Tribunal 
(see section 71).
(2) If the Secretary does so, the Secretary may correct the amount by increasing or 
decreasing it.
(3) If the Secretary increases the incentive by an amount, the Secretary must give 
effect to the increase by:
(a) issuing an amended tax offset certificate for the NRAS year; or
(b) if the approved participant agrees—adding the amount to an incentive for a 
future NRAS year; or
(c) if the incentive was given as a payment—paying the amount.
(4) If the Secretary decreases the incentive by an amount, the Secretary may recover 
the amount:
(a) by issuing an amended tax offset certificate for the NRAS year; or
(b) by offsetting the amount against an amount of incentive for a future NRAS 
year; or
(c) if the incentive was given as a payment or has been claimed as a tax 
offset—as a debt due to the Commonwealth.

Section 73

National Rental Affordability Scheme Regulations 2020
Compilation No. 1
Compilation date: 14/10/2024
Part 9—Application and transitional provisions
  
73  Things done under the previous regulations
(1) If:
(a) a thing was done, or arose, for a particular purpose under the previous 
regulations; and
(b) the thing could be done, or could arise, for that purpose under this 
instrument;
the thing has effect for the purposes of this instrument (and may be dealt with) as 
if it had been done, or had arisen, for that purpose under this instrument.
(2) Without limiting subsection (1), a reference in that subsection to a thing being 
done, or arising, includes a reference to each of the following:
(a) an entitlement to incentive arising under the previous regulations;
(b) a request made under the previous regulations by an investor for an 
allocation to be transferred;
(c) a determination of breach under the previous regulations;
(d) a decision, payment, incentive, notice, application or other instrument 
being given or made.
Note 1:
An allocation made under the previous regulations may have additional special 
conditions imposed on it, or be transferred, revoked or otherwise dealt with, under this 
instrument (see subsection 6(2)).
Note 2:
Subsections (1) and (2) confirm that things can be done under this instrument in 
reliance on things done under the previous regulations. For example:
(a)
if an amount of incentive is still to be given on 1 April 2020, the entitlement to the 
incentive is treated as if it arose under this instrument and could result in a 
reduction of the amount before it is given under this instrument; or
(b)
if an investor request for transfer is still to be dealt with on 1 April 2020, the 
request is treated as if it had been made under this instrument and could result in a 
transfer under this instrument; or
(c)
if, on 1 April 2020, a decision about redirecting an incentive is still to be made 
following a determination of breach that has been made, the determination of 
breach is treated as if it had been made under this instrument and could result in a 
redirection under this instrument.
Note 3:
Other examples of the effect of subsection (1) are as follows:
(a)
a variation under subsection 23(1) of the previous regulations of a special 
condition is treated as if it had been done under section 19 of this instrument;
(b)
subsection 10(2) of this instrument also covers a transfer under the previous 
regulations that corresponds to a transfer under section 20 of this instrument.
(3) A special condition imposed on an allocation under paragraph 13(2)(b) of the 
previous regulations has effect for the purposes of this instrument (and may be 
dealt with) as if it had been imposed under this instrument.
Note:
This subsection allows a special condition that was imposed when the allocation was 
made to have effect, and to be varied or removed, under this instrument. Subsection (1) 
does not already provide for this because this instrument does not provide for the 
making of new allocations.

Application and transitional provisions  Part 9
  
Section 74
National Rental Affordability Scheme Regulations 2020
47
Compilation No. 1
Compilation date: 14/10/2024
(4) An incentive period arising for an allocation under the previous regulations has 
effect for the purposes of this instrument (and may be dealt with) as if it had 
arisen under this instrument.
Note:
This subsection confirms that the incentive period under the previous regulations for an 
allocation will continue under this instrument. Subsection (1) may not already provide 
for this because this instrument does not provide for the making of new allocations.
74  General conditions of allocations existing immediately before 1 April 2020
Despite subsection 73(1), a condition that:
(a) was on an allocation as a general condition under the previous regulations 
(the old general condition); and
(b) was in force immediately before 1 April 2020;
ceases to be in force on 1 April 2020.
Note 1:
This section confirms that, on 1 April 2020, the old general conditions of an allocation 
are replaced by the conditions set out in Division 2 of Part 2.
Note 2:
In contrast, special conditions imposed before 1 April 2020 will continue (see 
subsections 73(2) and (3)).
Note 3:
This instrument can apply to a contravention of an old general condition before 1 April 
2020 (see section 77). For example, an approved participant will have committed a 
compliance breach if it contravened the old condition before 1 April 2020 (see 
paragraph 24(3)(b)).
75  Determination relating to maximum rent
Subsections 12(2) and (3) (which deal with a determination by the Secretary 
relating to maximum rent) apply in relation to a particular charge of rent for a 
period during an NRAS year beginning on or after 1 May 2017.
76  Eligible tenants moving rental dwellings
Subsection 41(4) applies in relation to a move by an eligible tenant from one 
rental dwelling to another rental dwelling on or after 1 April 2020.
77  References to breaches etc.
To avoid doubt, a reference in this instrument to:
(a) a breach, or suspected breach, (however described); or
(b) circumstances giving rise to such a breach or suspected breach (however 
described);
applies to such a breach, suspected breach or circumstances whether happening 
before, on or after 1 April 2020.
78  Redirecting incentives for certain earlier transfers
(1) This section applies if:

subregulation 21A(1) of the previous regulations as in force immediately 
before 9 March 2019; and
(b) incentive relating to the allocation for an NRAS year was not redirected as 
described in subregulation 41(3) of the previous regulations because 
neither subparagraph 21D(1)(b)(ii) nor 22BH(2)(b)(ii) of the previous 
regulations could be satisfied; and
(c) the Secretary has not received a written request from the original approved 
participant for the incentive to be given to it.
Note:
Regulations 21A and 21D of the previous regulations continued to apply on and after 
9 March 2019 under regulation 41 of the previous regulations.
(2) The Secretary may give the gaining approved participant written notice inviting 
the gaining approved participant to, within 3 months after the notice is given, 
lodge a statement of compliance:
(a) for a rental dwelling covered by the allocation; and
(b) that includes statements and details for the NRAS year beginning on 1 May 
2018.
Subsections 42(3) to (5) (about timeframes) do not apply to the statement of 
compliance.
(3) If the gaining approved participant lodges a statement of compliance complying 
with subsection (2), the Secretary may give to the gaining approved participant 
the incentive referred to in paragraph (1)(b), and if the Secretary does so:
(a) section 63 (about passing on incentives) applies to the gaining approved 
participant for the incentive and an investor; and
(b) the original approved participant:
(i) despite subsection 50(1), is not entitled to receive the incentive; and
(ii) despite an arrangement to the contrary, is not required to pass on the 
incentive to the investor.
(4) Sections 61 (about notice) and 62 (about interests of investors) also apply in 
relation to a proposed redirection under subsection (3) of this section.
Note:
A decision under subsection (3) is reviewable by the Administrative Review Tribunal 
(see section 71).
79  Details of approved participants and investors
(1) The approved participant for a rental dwelling covered by an allocation must, by 
the end of 28 April 2020, have notified the Secretary of the following details:
(a) the details listed in subsection 47(1) (about the approved participant);
(b) the details listed in subsection 48(1) for each person who the approved 
participant believes is an investor for the dwelling.
Note:
No incentive is available for any period during which the approved participant fails to 
comply with this subsection (see subsections 13(2) to (4)).
(2) Subsection 48(2) also applies in relation to details described in paragraph (1)(b) 
of this section that are notified under this section.
