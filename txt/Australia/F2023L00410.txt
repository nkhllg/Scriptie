Residential Mortgage Lending 
Objective of this Reporting Standard 
This reporting standard outlines the requirements for the provision of information to APRA 
relating to an authorised deposit-taking institution’s residential mortgage lending. 
 
It includes Reporting Form ARF 223.0 Residential Mortgage Lending and the associated 
specific instructions. 
 
 
Authority 
1. 
This Reporting Standard is made under section 13 of the Financial Sector (Collection 
of Data) Act 2001. 
Purpose 
2. 
Information collected by Reporting Form ARF 223.0 Residential Mortgage Lending 
(ARF 223.0) is used by APRA for the purposes of prudential supervision. It may also 
be used by the Reserve Bank of Australia. 
Application and commencement 
3. 
This Reporting Standard applies to all authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADI) with 
the exception of: 
(a) 
providers of purchased payment facilities (PPFs); and 
(b) 
subject to paragraph 4 of this Reporting Standard, foreign ADIs. 
This Reporting Standard may also apply to the authorised non-operating holding 
company (NOHC) of an ADI (refer to paragraph 7). 
4. 
If APRA considers that a foreign ADI undertakes material residential mortgage lending 
in Australia, APRA may, by notice, apply this Reporting Standard to that ADI having 
regard to: 
Authorised Version F2023L00410 registered 03/04/2023

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 
 
March 2023 
ARS 223.0 - 2 
 
 
(a) 
the particular circumstances of the ADI; and 
(b) 
the extent to which information is required for the purposes of the prudential 
supervision of the ADI, 
and such a notice may specify that some or all of the requirements in this Reporting 
Standard apply to that ADI.  
5. 
APRA may, by notice, vary or revoke a notice given under this paragraph 4 having 
regard to: 
(a) 
the particular circumstances of the ADI; and 
(b) 
the extent to which information is required for the purposes of the prudential 
supervision of the ADI.  
6. 
This Reporting Standard applies for reporting periods ending on or after 31 March 
2023. 
Information required 
7. 
If an ADI to which this Reporting Standard applies is part of a Level 2 group, the ADI 
must provide APRA with the information required by ARF 223.0 at Level 2 for each 
reporting period unless the ADI is a subsidiary of an authorised NOHC. If the ADI is a 
subsidiary of an authorised NOHC, the ADI’s immediate parent NOHC must provide 
APRA with the information required by ARF 223.0, for each reporting period. In doing 
so, the immediate parent NOHC must comply with this Reporting Standard as if it were 
the relevant ADI. 
8. 
If an ADI to which this Reporting Standard applies is not part of a Level 2 group, the 
ADI must provide APRA with the information required by ARF 223.0 at Level 1. 
Method of submission 
9. 
The information required by this Reporting Standard must be given to APRA in 
electronic format using an electronic method available on APRA’s website or by a 
method notified by APRA prior to submission.  
Reporting periods and due dates 
10. 
Subject to paragraph 12, an ADI to which this Reporting Standard applies must provide 
the information required by this Reporting Standard in respect of each quarter ending 
30 September, 31 December, 31 March and 30 June. 
11. 
The information required by this Reporting Standard must be provided to APRA within 
35 calendar days after the end of the reporting period to which the information relates1. 
                                            
1  
For the avoidance of doubt, if the due date for a particular reporting period falls on a day other than a 
usual business day, an ADI is nonetheless required to submit the information required no later than the 
due date.

12. 
APRA may, by notice, change the reporting periods, or specified reporting periods, for 
a particular ADI, to require it to provide the information required by this Reporting 
Standard more frequently, or less frequently, having regard to: 
(a) 
the particular circumstances of the ADI; and 
(b) 
the extent to which the information is required for the purposes of the prudential 
supervision of the ADI.  
13. 
APRA may grant an ADI an extension of a due date in writing, in which case the new 
due date for the provision of the information will be the due date specified on the notice 
of extension. 
Quality control 
14. 
All information provided by an ADI under this Reporting Standard must be the product 
of processes and controls that have been reviewed and tested by the external auditor of 
the ADI as set out in Prudential Standard APS 310 Audit and Related Matters. 
Relevant standards and guidance statements issued by the Auditing and Assurance 
Standards Board provide information on the scope and nature of the review and testing 
required from external auditors. This review and testing must be done on an annual 
basis or more frequently if necessary to enable the external auditor to form an opinion 
on the accuracy and reliability of the information. 
15. 
All information provided by an ADI under this Reporting Standard must be subject to 
processes and controls developed by the ADI for the internal review and authorisation 
of that information. These systems, processes and controls are to assure the 
completeness and reliability of the information provided. 
Authorisation 
16. 
When an officer or agent of an ADI provides the information required by this Reporting 
Standard using the method notified by APRA, it will be necessary for the officer or 
agent to digitally sign the relevant information using a digital certificate acceptable to 
APRA. 
Minor alterations to forms and instructions 
17. 
APRA may make minor variations to: 
(a) 
a form that is part of this reporting standard, and the instructions to such a form, 
to correct technical, programming or logical errors, inconsistencies or anomalies; 
or 
(b) 
the instructions to a form, to clarify their application to the form 
without changing any substantive requirement in the form or instructions. 
18. 
If APRA makes such a variation it must notify each ADI that is required to report under 
this reporting standard.

(a) 
special purpose vehicles (SPVs) holding securitised assets may be treated as 
non-consolidated independent third parties for ARF 223.0, irrespective of 
whether the SPVs (or their assets) are consolidated for accounting purposes; 
and 
 
(b) 
the assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses of the relevant SPVs may be 
excluded from the ADI’s reported amounts in ARF 223.0.  
 
2. 
Where an ADI (or a member of its Level 2 consolidated group) participates in a 
securitisation that does not meet APRA’s operational requirements for regulatory 
capital relief under APS 120, or the ADI undertakes a funding-only securitisation or 
synthetic securitisation (per APS 120), such assets are to be reported in ARF 223.0.

Definitions 
 
Terms highlighted in bold italics indicate that the definition is provided in these instructions. 
 
Definitions of security types and loan purposes 
 
Dwelling 
A self-contained room or suite of rooms, including cooking and bathing 
facilities, intended for long-term residential use. A dwelling is private 
(not generally accessible by the public) and is contained within a 
building that is an immobile structure. A dwelling may comprise part of 
a building or the whole of a building. Regardless of whether they are 
self-contained or not, rooms within buildings offering institutional care 
(e.g. hospitals) or temporary accommodation (e.g. hotels, motels or 
hostels) are not defined as dwellings. 
Investment 
A loan for the purpose of housing, where the funds are used for a 
residential property that is not owner-occupied. 
Where the loan is for a residential property that is different to the 
residential property against which the loan is secured, this definition 
refers to the occupation status of the residential property for which the 
loan has been obtained (not the occupation status of the property used as 
security). 
It includes: holiday or vacation homes and part-time residences that are 
not the borrower’s or borrowers’ principal place of residence. 
It excludes: part-time residences that are the borrower’s or borrowers’ 
principal place of residence. These should be reported under owner-
occupied. 
Owner-occupied 
A loan for the purpose of housing, where the funds are used for a 
residential property, that is occupied or to be occupied by the 
borrower(s) as their principal place of residence. 
Where the loan is for a residential property that is different to the 
residential property against which the loan is secured, this definition 
refers to the occupation status of the residential property for which the 
loan has been obtained (not the occupation status of the residential 
property used as security). 
It includes: 
  dwellings and residential land that are vacant while under 
construction, but that the borrower intends to occupy as a principal 
place of residence; 
  part-time residences that are the borrower’s or borrowers’ principal 
place of residence. 
It excludes: 
  part-time residences that are not the borrower’s or borrowers’ 
principal place of residence. These should be reported as 
investment. 
Where finance is to be used for more than one purpose (owner-occupied, 
investment or non-housing purposes), the entire amount of the finance

March 2023 
ARF 223.0 Instructions - 13 
 
should be classified according to the predominant purpose (i.e. the 
purpose for which the largest share of the funds will be used). 
Where there is any doubt or ambiguity about whether a loan is for an 
owner-occupied or investment property, report the loan as for 
investment. 
Non-housing 
purposes 
A loan secured by residential property where the funds are not used for 
the purchase, renovation or development of residential property. For 
example, personal loans secured by residential property. 
Residential land 
Any vacant land that does not have a dwelling attached, where the 
construction of a dwelling is allowed under zoning regulations. 
Residential 
property 
 
Residential land and dwellings. 
Secured in 
Australia 
Loans where the majority (by valuation) of residential property used as 
collateral for the loan is located in Australia. 
Secured 
overseas 
Loans where the majority (by valuation) of residential property used as 
collateral for the loan is located outside Australia. 
Units or 
apartments 
Dwellings in a building that has more than two dwellings. These 
dwellings do not have their own private grounds and usually share a 
common entrance foyer or stairwell. Do not include duplexes, 
townhouses or a detached residence that includes a flat (such as a granny 
flat) on the same property. Dwellings included in this item are 
categorised as class 13 ‘Flats, units or apartments’ in the Australian 
Bureau of Statistics’ (ABS) Functional Classification of Buildings, 1999 
(Revision 2011) Cat. no. 1268.0.55.001.

Loan 
serviceability 
assessment rate

serviceability rate does not consider other serviceability factors such as 
discounts or haircuts to income. 
Loan-to-income 
ratio 
The ratio of the credit limit of the loan to the borrower's gross income. 
Loan-to-
valuation ratio

Definitions of loan types and characteristics 
 
30-89 days past-
due 
Loans that are at least 30 days past-due but less than 90 days past-due, 
whether or not the loan is well secured or non-performing. This should 
be based on the original contractual terms of the loan, not restructured 
terms or temporary concessions. 
Amortising 
Loans on which interest is paid and principal is automatically amortised. 
Also known as principal and interest loans. 
Exceptions to 
serviceability 
policy 
Loans approved either with negative serviceability, below the ADI’s 
serviceability threshold or that have been granted other credit policy 
waivers related to serviceability. Include loans: 
  with net income surplus less than $0 or below the ADI’s minimum 
serviceability threshold, temporary or otherwise (e.g. bridging 
finance); 
  with net income surplus of more than $0 or the ADI’s minimum 
serviceability threshold, but where input parameters have been 
adjusted below policy minimum levels (e.g. changes to interest rate 
floors or expense assumptions); and 
  where additional income outside of policy is included to achieve net 
income surplus above $0 or the ADI’s minimum serviceability 
threshold. 
Exclude loans: 
  that initially fail automated internal decision tools but meet 
serviceability policy requirements after income is manually added; 
and 
  with non-serviceability policy exceptions (for example, valuation 
and LVR exceptions). 
Externally 
refinanced 
Loans where a new loan is obtained to replace an existing loan that was 
provided by a different lender (that is not within the regulated ADI 
itself). It excludes: 
  refinanced loans for a different residential property. These 
should only be reported as new funded loans.  
Funded 
A loan is considered funded once any portion of the funds is made available 
for the borrower to draw down according to the terms of the contract, 
whether or not it is drawn down within that period.  
Interest-only 
Loans on which only interest is paid during a set period and no principal 
is automatically amortised. The loans will typically revert to principal-
and-interest repayments at the end of the interest-only period. Only 
report loans as interest-only loans during their interest-only period. 
Lenders 
mortgage 
insurance 
(LMI) 
As defined in paragraph 14(o) of APS 112. 
Low-
documentation 
A loan for which the lender has not, prior to loan origination, fully 
documented and verified the income of the borrower.

March 2023 
ARF 223.0 Instructions - 17 
 
Mortgagee in 
possession 
Loans for which the ADI has taken possession of the property securing 
the loan due to borrower default. Do not include loans where the 
property has been sold. 
Offset accounts 
Deposit accounts that are offset against the balance of an outstanding 
loan when calculating the interest owing. Exclude accounts with no 
credit outstanding associated with them, and all-in-one facilities where 
it is not possible to separate the loan balance from the borrower’s 
deposits. 
Non-
Performing 
Loans that are non-performing as defined in Prudential Standard APS 
220 Credit Risk Management (APS 220). 
Past-due 
Loans that are past-due as defined in APS 220. 
Reverse 
mortgages 
Loans secured by residential property in which repayments are generally 
deferred and capitalised, with full repayment due when the owner dies, 
sells the property or moves out of the house. 
Revolving credit 
Lending facilities that the borrower may repeatedly draw down, in part 
or in full up to an authorised credit limit, and repay any credit drawn, in 
part or in full, on multiple occasions without the facility being cancelled. 
Repayments (other than of charges and interest) reduce the borrowings, 
thereby increasing the amount of unused credit available. Include 
facilities with a fixed term that meet the above criteria. Include reverse 
mortgages. 
Serviceability 
verification 
waivers 
Loans with material waivers to serviceability verification requirements, 
which may impact the reliability of the serviceability assessment. 
Temporary 
modifications 
due to financial 
difficulty 
Loans where the ADI has made temporary modifications to the 
conditions to the loan, for example, temporary concessions to 
repayments, due to the financial difficulty of the borrower. 
Term loans 
Loans extended for a fixed period, with a maturity date by which the 
loan must be repaid. Repayments over the fixed period reduce the credit 
outstanding and do not make further finance available. Include redraw 
facilities attached to fixed-term loans as part of the term loan. Exclude 
reverse mortgages, report reverse mortgages as revolving credits. 
Third-party 
originated 
Loans where the ADI’s primary contact with the borrower at origination 
is through a mortgage broker or another party (including a related body 
corporate) that is not within the regulated ADI itself. This includes 
where this third party accepts or completes applications, and is 
regardless of whether the third party has the ability to approve 
transactions or not.
