Reasons for exemption
The exemption has been granted for the following reasons:
(a)
a requirement that registered members must be licensed under the Act is
too onerous having regard to—
(i)
the small volume of real estate agency work that they carry out;
and
(ii)
the type of real estate agency work they carry out:
(b)
the activities that registered members are allowed to perform under the
exemption are limited:
(c)
requiring registered members to be licensed to carry out those activities
provides no material benefit for consumers:

Schedule 2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(d)
the rules, and the terms and conditions specified in clause 4, provide the
necessary protection for consumers when registered members carry out
real estate agency work in respect of real estate used in forestry.
6
Requirements of Part prevail in cases of inconsistency with rules
If an inconsistency exists between the provisions of the rules and the provisions
of this Part, the provisions of this Part prevail.

Clerk of the Executive Council.
Explanatory note
This note is not part of the regulations, but is intended to indicate their general effect.
These regulations, which come into force on 1 November 2017, allow registered
members of the New Zealand Institute of Forestry (NZIF) Te Pūtahi Ngāherehere o
Aotearoa Incorporated (NZIF) to carry out real estate agency work without being li-
censed under the Real Estate Agents Act 2008.
The exemption is subject to terms and conditions and is supported by a memorandum
of understanding between the Ministry of Justice and the NZIF dated 25 July 2017.
Essentially, a registered member of the NZIF may not act as a replacement for a real
estate agent with respect to a forestry sector transaction.
The NZIF has undertaken to report annually to the Ministry of Justice on compliance
with the terms and conditions, which provides a regular opportunity for the Minister
to consider whether the exemption should continue to apply. The NZIF has also
undertaken not to amend any provision in the rules without the approval of the Minis-
try of Justice.
Issued under the authority of the Legislation Act 2012.
Date of notification in Gazette: 17 August 2017.
These regulations are administered by the Ministry of Justice.
