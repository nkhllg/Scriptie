Assessment of compensation
(1)
The amount of compensation payable under this Act, whether for land taken,
land injuriously affected, or otherwise, shall be assessed in accordance with the
following provisions:
(a)
subject to the provisions of sections 72 to 76, no allowance shall be
made on account of the taking of any land being compulsory:
(b)
the value of land shall, except as otherwise provided, be taken to be that
amount which the land if sold in the open market by a willing seller
to a willing buyer on the specified date might be expected to realise,
unless—
(i)
the assessment of compensation relates to any matter which is not
directly based on the value of land and in respect of which a right
to compensation is conferred under this or any other Act; or
(ii)
only part of the land of an owner is taken or acquired under this
Act and that part is of a size, shape, or nature for which there
is no general demand or market, in which case the compensation
for such land and the injurious affection caused by such taking or
acquisition may be assessed by determining the market value of
the whole of the owner’s land and deducting from it the market
value of the balance of the owner’s land after the taking or acquis‐
ition:
(c)
where the value of the land taken for any public work has, on or before
the specified date, been increased or reduced by the work or the prospect
of the work, the amount of that increase or reduction shall not be taken
into account:
(d)
the special suitability or adaptability of the land, or of any natural mater‐
ial acquired or taken under section 27, for any purpose shall not be taken
into account if that purpose is a purpose to which it could be applied
only pursuant to statutory powers, or a purpose for which there is no
market apart from the special needs of a particular purchaser or the
requirements of any government department or of any local authority:
(e)
the Tribunal shall take into account by way of deduction from that part
of the total amount of compensation that would otherwise be awarded
on any claim in respect of a public work that comprises the market
value of the land taken and any injurious affection to land arising out
of the taking, any increase in the value of any land of the claimant that
is injuriously affected, or in the value of any other land in which the
claimant has an interest, caused before the specified date or likely to be
caused after that date by the work or the prospect of the work:
(f)
the Tribunal shall take into account, by way of deduction from the total
amount of compensation that would otherwise be awarded, any increase
in the value of the parcel of land in respect of which compensation is

in the case of any claim in respect of land of the claimant which has been
taken pursuant to section 26, the date on which the land became vested
in the Crown or in the local authority, as the case may be:

local authority has (before the issue of the Proclamation) notified the
Tribunal what land he or it proposes to take—
(i)
the date of that notification; or
(ii)
the date of the first entry upon the land for construction purposes;
or
(iii)
the date on which the land is first injuriously affected by the work;
or
(iv)
the date of any agreement made under section 80(1)(c) or any date
specified in such an agreement—
whichever is the earliest:
(c)
in the case of any other claim in respect of land of the claimant which
has been or is proposed to be taken for any work, the date on which the
land became by Proclamation or declaration vested in the Crown or in
the local authority, as the case may be, or the date on which the land was
first entered upon for the purpose of the construction or the carrying out
of the work, whichever is the earliest:
(d)
in the case of any claim in respect of any work for which no land of
the claimant has been taken and no land of the claimant is proposed to
be taken, the date of the commencement of the execution of the portion
of the work that causes damage to or injuriously affects the land of the
claimant:

purpose of assessing compensation under this Act, be valued separately from
the freehold.

Compensation for injurious affection where no land taken
(1)
Where—
(a)
substantial injurious affection to a person’s land is caused by the con‐
struction (but not the maintenance or operation) of a public work; and
(b)
the injurious affection is not caused by changes of traffic flows arising
out of the opening of any new road or motorway or the widening,
upgrading, or deviation of an existing road; and
(c)
there would exist a right of action at common law in respect of the
injurious affection by the owner of the land against the Crown or the
local authority, as the case may require,—
the Crown (acting through the Minister) or local authority shall compensate
that person to such extent as the injurious affection warrants.
(2)
In determining the existence of any right of action for the purposes of subsec‐
tion (1)(c), the existence of any statutory authority or immunity that may be
available to the Crown or local authority shall be disregarded.
(3)
The provisions of this section shall not apply where construction of that part
of the public work which causes the injurious affection has been commenced
before the claimant acquired the land that is injuriously affected.

work
Where land is taken or acquired from any person for the purpose of construct‐
ing any public work which is to be situated partly on that land and partly on
other land, compensation for injurious affection of the land retained by that
person shall be assessed by reference to the effect of the whole of the public
work on the land so retained and not only to the part situated on the land taken
or acquired from that person.

65
Compensation for land for which no general demand exists
(1)
Where land that is taken or acquired for a public work was devoted to a
purpose of such a nature that there is no general demand or market for land for
that purpose, compensation may be assessed on the basis of the reasonable cost
of equivalent reinstatement in some other place if the Land Valuation Tribunal
or, in the case of any claim not before the Tribunal, the Minister or the local
authority, is satisfied that such reinstatement is in good faith intended.

rate fixed under the mortgage of the land taken or acquired and the rate fixed
under the mortgage of the land acquired in substitution, during the term for

(b)
loss of the goodwill of any such business, if—

the application by the Minister and shall be open for acceptance for a period of
3 months after the date of the offer.
(5)
If the extent of land to be taken cannot be accurately defined when the offer
is made, the offer shall be deemed to be an offer by way of compensation
without prejudice to the right of the Minister to make an application under
section 79, or the right of the owner to bring a claim for compensation under
this Act upon the issue of a Proclamation or declaration under this Act, and if
the compensation so assessed is less than the amount paid to the owner by way
of compensation, then the award of the Tribunal shall be for the payment by the

Claimant’s acts making execution of work more costly
(1)
For the purposes of this section, the term relevant date means—
(a)
the date on which notification was given under section 18(1)(a); or
(b)
the date on which a requirement was notified under section 167 of the
Resource Management Act 1991,—
as the case may be.
(2)
If the Land Valuation Tribunal considers that the claimant in respect of any
land taken or acquired for a public work has at any time after the relevant date
done anything on or under the land with the purpose and effect of rendering
the execution of the work more difficult or costly, the Tribunal shall take into
account, by way of deduction from the amount of compensation to be awarded,
any increase in the cost of executing the work caused or likely to be caused
thereby; and if the Tribunal considers such increase in cost exceeds the value
of the land taken, the award shall be for the payment by the claimant to the
respondent of the amount of such excess and the costs of the inquiry.
(3)
The carrying out of repairs or maintenance to any improvements on the land
to a value not exceeding, in any 3-yearly period, 15% of the value of the
improvements on that land as shown on the valuation roll for the district, shall
for the purposes of this section be deemed not to have been done with the
purpose and effect of rendering the execution of the work on that land more
difficult or costly.
(4)
Where any such claimant has at any time after the relevant date done anything
on or under the land with the effect of rendering the execution of the work
more difficult or costly he shall be presumed to have done so with that purpose
unless he proves that in so doing he took reasonable precautions to avoid that
effect.
(5)
If the owner or occupier of any land wishes to do anything on or under the land
which may cause the amount of compensation payable to him to be reduced
under this section, he may apply for permission to do that thing on or under his

The claim
77
By whom compensation may be claimed
A claim for compensation may be made by the owner of any land who claims
to be entitled to compensation under this Act whether such person has or has
not the power to sell and convey the land, or by any executor or administrator
of such person; and any such claim on behalf of any beneficiary, ward, or
mentally disordered person may be made by his trustee, guardian, or manager,
respectively.

Limitation of time for claiming compensation
(1)
Subject to the provisions of this or any other Act, a claim for compensation
under this Act or any former Act relating to public works shall not be made
(in respect of any land taken) after a period of 2 years after the date of the
Proclamation or declaration taking the land, or (in respect of any other claim
under this Act) after a period of 2 years after the execution of the works or the
exercise of the power out of which such claim has arisen or may arise.
(2)
For the purposes of this section the term execution of the works means the
completion of the construction of any portion of a work where that portion
in itself (and without reference to any other part of the work) causes the
damage or injurious affection; and that portion of the work shall be deemed
to be completed when anything further that may be required to be done to
finish it will have no effect either to increase or lessen the damage or injurious
affection.
(3)
Either period of 2 years referred to in subsection (1) may, on application made
either before or after the expiration of that period, be extended by the Minister
or local authority, as the case may be, upon or subject to such conditions as
he or it thinks fit, to such period (not exceeding 6 years after the date of the
Proclamation or declaration taking the land or the date of execution of the work
or the exercise of the power, as the case may require) as the Minister or local
authority thinks fit.
(4)
The period of 2 years referred to in subsection (1) shall, in the case of a claim
in respect of damage arising out of the execution or operation of any irrigation
works, be deemed to be a period of 2 years after the day on which the race or
dam or other part of the works which in itself causes the damage is first filled
for irrigation purposes to the level intended to be normal.
(5)
Any applicant under subsection (3) who is dissatisfied with any decision made
by the Minister or local authority under that subsection may appeal to the
Tribunal in respect of that matter and the decision of the Tribunal shall be final.

Minister or local authority may take proceedings to determine
compensation if person entitled fails to make claim
(1)
At any time after the expiration of 3 months after the date on which any person
has acquired any right to make a claim for compensation, if that person has
failed to make the claim, the Minister or the local authority may give notice in
writing to that person of his or its intention, after the expiration of 4 months
after the date on which the notice is given, to apply to the Land Valuation
Tribunal to determine what amount of compensation (if any) shall be paid to
that person in respect of the matters and land specified in the notice, and in
respect of all claims arising at or about the same time which the claimant may
have.
(2)
If after the expiration of that period of 4 months and of any extension of it
which the Tribunal may allow on application made to it in that behalf within
that period, the person to whom the notice has been given has failed to make
the claim in accordance with section 82, the Minister or the local authority, as
the case may be, may apply to the Land Valuation Tribunal to determine what
amount of compensation (if any) shall be paid to that person in respect of the
matters and land specified in the application, and to fix a suitable date for the
hearing of the application.
(3)
If application is made to the Tribunal under this section, notice of the applica‐
tion shall be given not less than 2 months before the date of the hearing of the
application to the person whose rights are to be determined thereby, and that
person may—
(a)
not less than 20 working days before the date fixed for the hearing of the
application, file in the office of the Tribunal nearest to the place where
the land is situated, and serve on the applicant, particulars of the claim
(if any) which he makes in respect of the matters and land to which the
application relates:
(b)
appear and be heard on the application or claim so filed.
(4)
Subject to the provisions of this section, the Tribunal shall proceed to hear the
parties and to examine the claim (if filed), or if no claim is filed to examine
the application as if it were a claim duly made by the person to whom the
application relates, but if no claim has been filed in accordance with subsection
(3)(a), but the person whose rights are to be determined has appeared and been
heard, the applicant shall be entitled to an adjournment for a reasonable period
if he or it wishes to make any further investigation of any matter arising in the
claimant’s evidence.
(5)
If the circumstances render it desirable to do so, the Tribunal may hear together
2 or more applications under this section.

Accelerating hearing of compensation claims
(1)
A claim for compensation in respect of the taking of any land of any person
for any public work shall lie and may be enforced in accordance with the
provisions of this Act notwithstanding that no Proclamation or declaration
taking the land has issued if—
(a)
the Minister or the local authority has issued a notice under section
18(1)(a) in respect of the land; or
(b)
the execution has been completed of every portion of the work which
will affect the amount of the land of that person which will have to be
taken for the work or which will injuriously affect or damage the land of
that person; or
(c)
the Minister or local authority and the owner of the land to be taken for
any work have agreed to the land being taken and to the compensation
being assessed in accordance with this Part.
(2)
In any case to which subsection (1)(a) applies, the claimant shall by notice in
writing require the Minister or local authority to indicate whether the Minister
or local authority intends to proceed with the acquisition of the claimant’s land.
(3)
If the Minister or local authority confirms the intention to acquire the land or
if paragraph (b) or paragraph (c) of subsection (1) applies, the claimant shall
proceed with the claim under this section and the making of such a claim shall
operate for the purposes of section 17 as an agreement by the claimant under
section 17 to the claimant’s estate or interest in that land being taken subject
to subsection (7) and subject to the compensation to be paid being left to be
determined under this Part.
(4)
If at the expiration of a period of 3 months from the date on which the notice
pursuant to subsection (2) was given to the Minister, or local authority—
(a)
the Minister or local authority has not indicated in writing the intention
to proceed with the acquisition of the claimant’s land; or
(b)
the notice given under section 18(1)(a) has not been withdrawn or has
not lapsed,—
then the claimant may advise the Minister or local authority in writing that the
notice given under subsection (2) is to constitute—
(c)
an agreement by the claimant to the claimant’s estate or interest in that
land being taken, subject to subsection (7) and subject to the compensa‐
tion to be paid being left to be determined under this Part; or
(d)
a withdrawal of the notice given in respect of the claimant’s land under
section 18(1)(a).
(5)
In any case to which subsection (1)(b) applies, the making of a claim under
this section in respect of any land to be taken shall operate, for the purposes
of section 17, as an agreement by the claimant to the claimant’s estate or
Part 5 s 80

interest in that land being taken subject to subsection (7) and subject to the
compensation to be paid being left to be determined under this Part.
(6)
Any requirement or claim made under this section shall—
(a)
operate to automatically withdraw any objection made by the claimant
under section 23 to the taking of the same land; and
(b)
prevent the commencement or prosecution of any proceedings by or on
behalf of the claimant to prevent or delay the execution of the work or
the taking of the land which is the subject of the requirement or claim
made under this section.
(7)
If a Proclamation or declaration taking or acquiring the land has not been
issued when the Land Valuation Tribunal commences to hear any claim made
under this section, the Minister or the local authority shall, at the commence‐
ment of the hearing, notify as nearly as may be what land (if any) is proposed
to be taken; and the Tribunal shall hear the claim and assess compensation as if
that land had been so taken.
(8)
For the purpose of any claim made under this section the forms prescribed in
Schedules 3 and 4 may be varied to such extent as may be necessary to express
the circumstances of the claim.

an infant, a mentally disordered person, a person under some other legal
disability, or a beneficiary under a trust, not having a guardian, manager,
or trustee; or
(b)
of unknown whereabouts and has no known agent; or

and in the absence of steps taken to appoint a person to represent that person,
the Minister or the local authority may, after notifying Public Trust, apply to
the District Court for an order authorising Public Trust to act as if it were
the legal guardian, manager, trustee, or agent, as the case may require, of that
person.
(2)
On the making of such an order Public Trust shall for the purposes of this Act
be deemed to be the legal guardian, manager, trustee, or agent of the person
in respect of whom the order was made and, notwithstanding the provisions of
any Act, rule of law, deed, or other instrument, may enter into an agreement
with the Minister or local authority for the acquisition of the land under section
17 or section 18 or for the payment of the purchase price or compensation.

the sum of any award interest, calculated in accordance with (or on a basis that
ensures it does not exceed interest calculated in accordance with) Schedule 2 of
the Interest on Money Claims Act 2016, on the whole or any part of the award
for the whole or any part of the period between the specified date or, where
appropriate, the date on which the claimant gives vacant possession of the land
(whichever is later) and the date of making of the award.

(i)
to the discharge of any debt or encumbrance affecting the land, or

in the purchase of other land to be conveyed, limited, and settled
upon the like uses, trusts, or purposes:
(iii)
in removing any buildings on the land, or substituting others in

or purchase money in respect of any interest to which he may be declared
entitled under any award, or which has been agreed to be paid to him.
(3)
Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (1), where the person having the
partial or qualified interest in the land and not entitled to sell or convey it is a
local authority, the compensation money or purchase money may be paid to the
local authority.
(4)
The local authority shall record any money paid to it under subsection (3) in a
separate account and shall invest it separately; and shall expend it only for the
permanent improvement of other land held for the same or like uses, trusts, and
purposes or for all or any of the purposes set out in subparagraphs (i) and (ii)
of subsection (1)(c), so that such application of the money will benefit persons
substantially in the same locality.

the debt to be discharged—
(a)
the mortgagor and mortgagee may agree; or
(b)
failing agreement, the Tribunal shall determine—
what part of the compensation or purchase money shall be paid in discharge
of part of the mortgage debt, so that the remaining part of the mortgaged
land constitutes as good security as before for the part of the mortgage debt
remaining undischarged.
(2)
Notwithstanding anything in this section, the Minister or local authority, as
the case may be, shall have a discretion to pay the mortgagor the full amount

the part of the rent charge remaining unredeemed.
(3)
Notwithstanding anything in this section, the Minister or local authority, as
the case may be, shall have a discretion to pay the owner of the land the full

the lessor and lessee may agree; or

On completion of such surveys (if any) as may be necessary, there shall be
registered with the Registrar-General of Land a certificate by the Minister,

form set out in Schedule 5.
(8)
Upon receipt of a certificate from the Minister or the Minister of Railways, the

the person to whom the land is granted; and the Registrar-General of Land shall
register it without fee.
(9A) Subject to subsection (9C), any certificate issued under this section may con‐
tain a recital that the land to which the certificate relates shall be amalgamated
with any other land in an existing record of title; and that recital shall be suffi‐
cient authority to the Registrar-General of Land to amend such record of title
accordingly, without fee. On such amendment the land granted shall become
subject to and, where applicable, receive the benefit of, all encumbrances,
easements, and other interests noted on the record of title.
(9B) Where any land is so amalgamated, the Registrar-General of Land may, if he
or she thinks fit, dispense with any survey that would otherwise be required for
the purposes of the issuing of a record of title under this section, and may issue
a record of title qualified as described in section 17(1)(a) of the Land Transfer
Act 2017.
(9C) Before including a recital in a certificate under subsection (9A), the Minister,
Minister of Railways, or local authority, as the case may be, shall consult
with the Registrar-General of Land as to whether or not it is practicable to
amalgamate the land in an existing record of title and, if the Registrar-General
of Land advises that it is not practicable to do so, no such recital shall be
included in the certificate.

person to whom the land is to be granted, may show that the land to which
the certificate relates is to be subject to or is to have the benefit of any such
encumbrance, lien, or interest that is specified in the certificate.
(15)
Every instrument creating or evidencing or affecting any such encumbrance,
lien, or interest, and all covenants and other provisions expressed or implied
therein, shall be construed as if the land for which the record of title is issued
were the land, or (as the case may be) part of the land, to which the instrument
relates.
(16)
The Registrar-General of Land must record on the relevant record of title
memorials showing that the land is affected by subsections (14) and (15) and

In this section, unless the context otherwise requires,—
artificial lake means a body of water formed or impounded by a Government
work or by a work acquired by the Crown
natural lake means a lake that is not an artificial lake.
(2)
Where a natural lake exists before the construction of a Government work, or
a work acquired by the Crown, which increases the area of that lake, the whole
of the lake as so increased in area shall be deemed to be a natural lake for the
purposes of this section.
(3)
In addition to all powers of making regulations in respect of lakes conferred
on him by the Harbours Act 1950 or by any other Act, but subject to the
Resource Management Act 1991 and subsection (4), the Governor-General
may from time to time, by Order in Council, in respect of any artificial lake,
make regulations—
(a)
prohibiting, or permitting, regulating, and prescribing terms and condi‐
tions for, the use of the lake or its waters or any part of it or its waters:
(b)
prohibiting, or permitting, regulating, and prescribing terms and condi‐
tions for, the discharge into or placing in the lake of any solid or liquid
matter likely to settle in the lake, or cause an obstruction in it, or inter‐
fere with any authority or person lawfully using the lake, or its waters, or
any part of it or its waters:
(c)
prescribing fines, not exceeding $500 in any case, for the breach of any
regulations made under this section.
(4)
Any regulations made under subsection (3)(b) shall not permit the discharge or
placing of any matter into or in the lake in contravention of any legislation.

any part of a Government work constructed for the purpose of utilising
the waters of the lake; or
(b)
any outlet of the lake as it exists from time to time—
where a work designed for the control of the level of the waters of the lake is
constructed on a river or stream flowing from the lake, in the same manner as if
those parts of the natural lake were parts of an artificial lake.
(7)
The power of making regulations under this section may be exercised in
respect of such part of any river or stream as lies between a work constructed
for the control of the level of the waters of a lake from which it flows and the
outlet of the lake, in the same manner as if that part of the river or stream were
an artificial lake.

214
Liability of occupier for annual charge
(1)
Except where a water availability agreement referred to in section 216 is
entered into and the annual charge payable under that agreement is greater
than the annual basic charge payable in respect of any land, every occupier
of land in an irrigation district shall (subject to any deferments of charges for
the development period as provided for in section 202 and the recovery of
the deferred charges by approximately equal amounts) pay to the Minister an
annual charge for each of the seasons in the period specified in the notice under
section 202(1)(a)(vi).
(2)
The annual charge referred to in subsection (1) as the liability of an occupier
shall be an amount calculated in accordance with the following formula:
b × h
where—
b
is the basic charge calculated in accordance with section 209 and adjus‐
ted, if required, in accordance with section 210; and

Determination of irrigable area
(1)
The irrigable area of the land of any occupier in any irrigation district shall be
determined by the Minister and may be so redetermined from time to time.
(2)
Such irrigable area shall be expressed as the number, including any part of a
whole number to 1 decimal place, of irrigable hectares.
Part 19 s 213
Public Works Act 1981
Version as at

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(3)
The irrigability of any area of land shall be determined after consideration of
the nature of the land, the capability of the water supply works to supply water
to the land, and any limitations to the capability of the water supply scheme to
supply water to all the land in the irrigation district that is potentially irrigable.
(4)
In determining from time to time the irrigable area of land, the Minister shall
take into consideration any request made in writing by an occupier as to the
irrigable area of any part of his land.
(5)
Where any occupier is dissatisfied with any determination of the Minister
under this section, the occupier and the Minister shall each appoint an assessor
to determine the matter, and, subject to subsection (6), the decision of the
assessors shall be final.
(6)
Where the assessors appointed under subsection (5) are unable to agree on the
irrigable area of the land of any occupier the assessors shall—
(a)
appoint an adjudicator; or
(b)
where they cannot agree on the appointment of an adjudicator, apply to
the District Court nearest to the land concerned for the appointment of
an adjudicator—
and the decision of the adjudicator shall be final.

Water availability agreements
(1)
The Minister may allocate water, to be supplied from the water supply works
for any irrigation district, to the occupier of any land in the district, and may
determine the conditions under which such water shall be so supplied. Each
allocation shall be expressed as a number of unit quantities or unit rates of
supply.
(2)
Each such allocation to an occupier shall be compatible with a scheme
approved by the Minister for the development through irrigation of the land
of the occupier and, in determining such allocation, the Minister shall take into
consideration any request made in writing by the occupier as to the allocation
the occupier desires.
(3)
The Minister, for and on behalf of the Crown, may enter into a water availabil‐
ity agreement with the occupier of any land in the irrigation district. Every
such agreement shall be in accordance with any allocations and conditions the
Minister has determined under subsections (1) and (10).

(4)
Every occupier of land in respect of which a water availability agreement is
entered into with the Minister shall, subject to the provisions of subsection
(7) and subject to any deferments of charges for the development period as
provided for in section 202 and the recovery of the deferred charges, pay to
the Minister an annual water availability charge for each of the seasons in the
period specified in the notice under section 202(1)(a)(vi).
(5)
The annual water availability charge referred to in subsection (4) as the liability
of an occupier shall be an amount calculated in accordance with the following
formula:
a × w
where—
a
is the water availability charge calculated in accordance with section 211
and adjusted, if required, in accordance with section 212; and
w
is the number of unit quantities or unit rates of supply allocated to that
occupier in accordance with subsection (1).
(6)
Every annual water availability charge referred to in subsection (4) as the
liability of an occupier shall, unless that occupier is exempt from payment
of it under subsection (7), become payable to the Minister at the end of the
irrigation season to which it relates, and shall be recoverable as a debt due to
the Crown.
(7)
For an irrigation season in which the amount payable under a water availability
agreement is equal to or less than the annual basic charge, the occupier shall be
exempt from payment of the annual water availability charge.
(8)
The holder of a water availability agreement may at any time apply to the
Minister for a variation in the number of unit quantities or unit rates of supply
allocated to the holder, or for the cancellation of the holder’s allocation.
(9)
On receiving such an application, the Minister may grant the application in
whole or in part by varying or cancelling the applicant’s allocation, as the case
may be, if—
(a)
the Minister is satisfied that to do so is likely to result in more beneficial
use of the available water; and
(b)
in the case of an application for a reduction or cancellation, the Minister
is satisfied that as a result of—
(i)
the increase of 1 or more other allocations with the consent of the
recipients; or
(ii)
the granting of 1 or more new allocations with the consent of the
recipients; or
(iii)
the availability of surplus water for supply in accordance with
section 217(3)—
to do so will not adversely affect the revenue of the irrigation district.

make new water availability agreements in accordance with the increased or
new allocations.

217
Supply of water
(1)
The Minister shall determine a time as the commencement of availability of
supply of water for each irrigation district or each part of it (being a time when
water is made available to a substantial proportion of the district or part of it,
as the case may be), and shall ensure that all occupiers in the district or part of
it are notified in writing of the time of such commencement within 3 months
before or after that time.
(2)
At any time before the commencement of availability of supply in accordance
with subsection (1), the Minister may supply any person with water from the
water supply works on such terms and conditions as he thinks reasonable.
(3)
If, at any time after the commencement of availability of supply, the Minister
is of the opinion that the supply of water from the water supply works is likely
to be in excess of the amount to be supplied in accordance with water availa‐
bility agreements, the Minister may supply the surplus water to any person
on conditions not more favourable than those applicable to water availability
agreements.

Diminished supply
(1)
Notwithstanding anything in this Part, if, during any season, water from the
water supply works fails or becomes diminished, or the Minister is required
by powers exercised under the Resource Management Act 1991 to cease or
reduce the supply of water, so that it is impracticable to supply to any occupier
the number of unit quantities or unit rates of supply agreed to be allocated or
supplied to the occupier under this Part, no person shall, by reason of such
failure or diminished supply or requirement, have any claim to compensation
or any right of action or other remedy against the Crown or the Minister.
(2)
If, during any season, it is impracticable to supply to any occupier the number
of unit quantities or unit rates of supply agreed to be allocated or supplied to
him under this Part, the charge payable by that occupier for that season shall be
reduced by such amounts as the Minister considers reasonable.

If at any time any money that is due and payable to the Crown in respect of any
basic charge or water availability charge or of water supplied under this Part
to or for the benefit of any land, whether or not such land is in an irrigation dis‐
trict, is unpaid, the Minister may without fee deposit with the Registrar-General
of Land a certificate under his hand describing the land and specifying the
amount due and unpaid in respect of it; and the Registrar-General of Land shall
without fee register the certificate against the title to the land affected by it.
(2)
While a certificate is so registered, no transfer, conveyance, mortgage, lease, or
other instrument affecting the land or any estate or interest therein, or any part
of it, shall be registered or lodged with the Registrar-General of Land without
the prior written consent of the Minister.
(3)

Application of this Part to existing schemes
(1)
If the Minister has, at any time within 5 years before the commencement of this
Act, supplied water for irrigation of land under any former enactment relating
to irrigation schemes, and it appears to the Minister that—
(a)
it is in the national interest; and
(b)
there is sufficient support for the proposal from the occupiers of the land
affected—
the Minister may decide that, in substitution for any existing provisions or
arrangements applying thereto and subject to such modifications as are appro‐

Controlling authority may bring action for damage to public work
In any case where any authority (including the Crown or any Minister of the
Crown or any public or local authority) has control of any public work but
the ownership of that work is not vested in that authority, proceedings for the
recovery of damages in respect of the removal or destruction of the work, or
in respect of any injury or damage to it, may be taken by that authority as
if it were the owner of the work; but damages in respect of the removal or
destruction of the work, or of any injury or damage to it, shall not be recovered
by both that authority and the owner of the work.

than 10 working days’ notice, by advertisement in 2 issues of a daily
newspaper circulating in the district in which the land held for the public
work is situated, of his or its intention to sell or destroy the property, but
if the Minister or the local authority is satisfied that the condition of the
property is such that it is of little or no value, he or it may dispense with
the giving of such notice:
(b)
if the property is a motor vehicle to which is affixed a licence to use the
vehicle for the current licensing year, the Minister or the local authority
may give not less than 10 working days’ notice to the person last regis‐
tered under Part 17 of the Land Transport Act 1998 in respect of the

the property—
(a)
pays to the Minister or the local authority the cost of removing the prop‐
erty pursuant to subsection (1), and the cost of the said advertisements;
and
(b)
takes away the property from the place to which it was removed—
the Minister or the local authority, at any time after the expiry of the notice,
may sell the property to any person, who shall thereupon become the lawful
owner of it, or the Minister or local authority may cause the property to be
destroyed, and in neither case shall any liability attach to the Minister or to
the local authority or to any other person for any loss or damage occasioned
thereby.

Recovery of land from persons holding illegal possession
(1)
Where any person is in occupation of any land held for, or to be taken,
purchased, or acquired for, any public work, without any right, title, or licence,
or whose right, title, or licence has expired or been forfeited, cancelled, or
extinguished, the Minister of Lands, or the local authority, in the case of a
local work, or any person appointed in writing by any of them, may commence
proceedings in the District Court nearest to the place where the land is situated
to recover possession of the land and damages for use and occupation; and in
any such case the jurisdiction of that court shall not be ousted on the plea that
a question of title is involved, or that the value of the premises possession of
which is sought to be recovered is above the jurisdiction of the court.
(2)
If, on the hearing of any such action,—
(a)
the defendant does not appear; or
(b)
it is shown to the satisfaction of the court that the title under which the
defendant claims has, as between himself and the Crown or the local
authority, as the case may be, expired or become liable to forfeiture or
cancellation—
the court shall declare such title to be extinguished, and may order that posses‐
sion of the land be given by the defendant to the plaintiff, either forthwith or on
or before such day as the court thinks fit to name; and that the defendant pay
damages for use and occupation and the costs of the action.
(3)
If delivery of the land is not made pursuant to such order the court may issue
a warrant authorising and requiring the bailiff of the court or any constable to
give possession of the land to the plaintiff.
