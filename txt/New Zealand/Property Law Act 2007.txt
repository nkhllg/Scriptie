it has arrived at maturity, and whether for the benefit of the mortgagor or
some other person; or
(e)
by way of re-advancement of amounts secured by the mortgage and
repaid to the mortgagee
stated priority limit means an amount expressly stated in a relevant mortgage
instrument as the maximum amount for which the mortgage has priority, in
relation to any subsequent mortgage.

Registrar to arrange sale
(1)
The Registrar must, as soon as practicable after receiving an application for
a sale under section 187 and after being satisfied of the matters specified in
subsection (2),—
(a)
approve the proposed sale; and
(b)
fix a convenient time (being not shorter than 1 month after the date of
the application) for the conduct of the sale; and
(c)
fix a convenient place for the conduct of the sale; and
(d)
if the vendor mortgagee has supplied their names and addresses under

things necessary for the proper conduct of the sale by public auction,
without reserve, of the land proposed to be sold; and

(2)
The matters of which the Registrar must be satisfied are—

that, by reason of a default that has not been remedied, the vendor
mortgagee has become entitled under the mortgage to exercise a power
to sell the mortgaged land proposed to be sold; and
(b)
that the vendor mortgagee has complied with all relevant provisions of
subpart 5 concerning the exercise of the power of sale.

Version as at
23 December 2023

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(2)
However, if the Registrar considers that, by reason of the character of the
land, advertisement in a newspaper circulating only in that locality is unlikely
to enable the vendor mortgagee to discharge the duty of care under section
176(1), the Registrar must give notice of the sale that the Registrar considers
sufficient by advertisement also in newspapers circulating in any other locali‐
ties that the Registrar thinks fit.
(3)
The High Court may, on the application of a specified person, direct the
Registrar to undertake further or other advertising of the sale, or marketing of
the land, that the High Court thinks fit.
(4)
In subsection (3), specified person means—
(a)
the current mortgagor; or
(b)
the vendor mortgagee; or
(c)
any other person who has an interest in the proposed sale.

extensive advertising of the sale or marketing of the land proposed to be sold
than is undertaken by the Registrar or directed by the court.
(6)
Costs reasonably incurred by the vendor mortgagee for the purpose referred to
in subsection (5) are, for the purposes of sections 87, 88, 152, 153, and 185,
amounts reasonably paid or advanced by the mortgagee with a view to the
realisation of the security.

Registrar may consent to correction of defect or error
The Registrar may, at any time before the sale, consent to the correction of
any defect or error in an application for a sale under section 187, or in any
supporting or consequential document, if satisfied that the correction will not
materially prejudice the current mortgagor or any other person who has an
interest in the proposed sale.
193
Withdrawal of land from sale
(1)
The Registrar may approve, under section 190, conditions of sale that include a
right on the part of the vendor mortgagee to withdraw from the sale the whole
or any part of the land proposed to be sold, at any time before the land has been
sold, and whether or not the bidding has reached the discharge sum nominated
for the land.
(2)
If, in the opinion of the Registrar, the vendor mortgagee unreasonably with‐
draws from sale the whole or any part of the land proposed to be sold, the
Registrar must disallow all or part of the expenses of, and incidental to, the sale
as the Registrar thinks fit.
(3)
For the purposes of sections 87, 88, 152, 153, and 185, no expense disallowed
under subsection (2) is an amount paid or advanced with a view to the realisa‐
tion of the security.

to any mortgage or other encumbrance having priority over the vendor mortga‐
gee’s mortgage, the amounts secured by that mortgage or other encumbrance to

time that the lease is terminated in accordance with section 210(2).
Compare: 1952 No 51 s 105
212
Lease terminating on occurrence of future event
(1)
A lease is not invalid only because it provides for its termination, or permits
notice of its termination to be given, on the occurrence of a future event so long
as the event is sufficiently defined in the lease that it can be identified when it
occurs.
(2)
However, the lease terminates on the tenth anniversary of the date on which the
term of the lease began (the tenth anniversary date) if that future event has
not occurred before that date.
(3)
Subsection (2) does not apply to a lease that provides for its termination on, or
for notice of its termination to be given on or before, a date that—
(a)
is fixed in the lease; and
(b)
is later than the tenth anniversary date.

subject to all the obligations of the lessee under the lease until the time that the
lessee ceases to be in possession of the land.
(2)
A lessor who accepts rent for any period after the lease has been terminated or
the term of the lease has expired is not, only because of that fact, to be treated
as having—
(a)
consented to the lessee remaining in possession of the land; or
(b)
given up any of the lessor’s rights or remedies against the lessee for
breach of a covenant or condition of the lease.
Compare: 1986 No 120 s 60

sublease is entered into, or purportedly entered into,—
(a)
by a lessee under the superior lease; and
(b)
for a term that will expire at the same time as, or later than, the time at
which the term of the superior lease expires.
(2)
A sublease to which this section applies does not, unless a contrary intention
appears, operate as an assignment of the superior lease to the sublessee.
(3)
If the term of a sublease to which this section applies will expire later than the
expiry of the term of the superior lease,—
(a)
the term of the sublease is reduced and will expire at the same time as
the term of the superior lease; and
(b)
the sublease cannot be registered under the Land Transfer Act 2017 but
is to be treated for all purposes as creating an equitable estate in the land.
(4)
Subsection (3) does not affect any remedy that the sublessee may have for the
reduction, in accordance with that subsection, of the term of the sublease.
(5)
If the term of the superior lease is extended or renewed, the term of the
sublease is extended and will expire at the earlier of the time that—

(6)

reduced, or extended by this section) expires at the same time as the term of the
superior lease, the sublessor must be treated as having a reversion expectant on
the sublease.

(2017 No 30).
216
Surrender of lease to enable new superior lease to be entered into not to
affect sublease
(1)
If a lease (lease A) is surrendered to allow a new lease (lease B) to be entered
into with the same lessee, a sublease in respect of lease A does not also have to
be surrendered if—
(a)
the term of the sublease, as expressed, will expire on or before the date
on which the term of lease B will expire; or
(b)
the sublease may be terminated by the sublessor giving a notice of
termination that takes effect on or before that date.
(2)
A sublease in respect of lease A continues in force as though it had been
entered into in respect of lease B and all the rights and obligations under the
sublease, including those that relate to any period before the surrender of lease
A, continue to be enforceable.
(3)
However, subsection (2) does not apply to any obligation under the sublease
that, because lease B has been entered into, is more onerous than it would have
been had lease A not been surrendered.
(4)
For the purposes of this section, a sublease in respect of lease A includes any
sublease entered into by a person deriving title through the lessee under lease
A.
(5)
For the purposes of section 95 of the Land Transfer Act 2017, a sublease in
respect of lease A is an interest to which lease B is deemed to be subject.

must be taken to be a reference to the covenants implied in that lease by—

section 218; and
(b)
section 219 (for a lease that is not a short-term lease) or section 220 (for
a short-term lease).
222
Time for payment of rent
The rent payable under a lease is payable monthly in advance (whether that
rent is expressed as an annual amount or in another way) unless the lessor and
the lessee agree otherwise.
223
Effect of covenant to keep premises in good condition
In a lease, unless the context otherwise requires, a covenant to keep leased
premises in good condition (or words to that effect) does not require the lessee
to put the premises into good condition if they are not in good condition when
the term of the lease begins.

Consent not to be unreasonably withheld or delayed
(1)
In a lease, unless the context otherwise requires, a covenant of the lessee not to
do a thing without the lessor’s consent must be taken as requiring the lessor—
(a)
not to unreasonably withhold consent to the doing of that thing by the
lessee; and
(b)
within a reasonable time, to—
(i)
give the consent; or
(ii)
notify the lessee in writing that the consent is withheld.

relation to any part of the leased premises, or for any part of the term of
the lease.
(2)
Sections 226 to 228 do not prevent a lease from including a covenant binding
the lessee absolutely not to do any of the things referred to in subsection (1).
(3)
To avoid doubt, sections 226 to 228 do not apply if, and to the extent that, a
lease includes, in accordance with subsection (2), a covenant binding the lessee
absolutely not to do any of the things referred to in subsection (1).
226
Consent to assignment, etc, or change of use
(1)
This section applies to a lessor who receives after 31 December 2007 an

operation before, on, or after that date).

requires the payment of an amount (whether by way of additional
rent, or by way of premium or fine) or other consideration; or
(ii)
imposes on the lessee any unreasonable condition or precondition;
or
(b)
consent is withheld because the lessee—

is in receivership or liquidation (if the lessee is a company); or
(iii)
is in receivership or is being liquidated under section 342 of the
Companies Act 1993 (if the lessee is an overseas company).
(2)
Subsection (1) does not limit section 226(2)(a), nor does it prevent the lessor
from requiring the lessee, if the lease so provides, to pay the reasonable legal or
other expenses of the lessor in giving consent.
(3)
If the lessor refuses consent, or gives consent subject to a condition or precon‐
dition, the lessor must, on the written request of the lessee, promptly give the

Merger of reversion not to affect remedies
(1)
This section applies to a lease if the reversion expectant on the lease is merged
in a remainder or other reversion, or in a future estate or interest in the land.
(2)
The person entitled to the estate or interest into which that reversion has
merged has the same remedies for non-performance or non-observance of the
covenants or conditions of the lease, and has the same rights to give notice to
the lessee of termination of the lease, as the person who would for the time
being (but for the merger) have been entitled to the reversion expectant on the
lease would have had.

Burden of lessor’s covenants to run with reversion

(1)
This section applies to a lease if the lessor has transferred or assigned the
reversion expectant on the lease.

to the transferor or assignor of that reversion is discharged to the extent of that
payment if the lessee had no actual notice of the transfer or assignment.

is not, in itself, actual notice to the lessee of the transfer, despite anything to the
contrary in any other enactment.
238
Effect of acknowledgement by lessee of another person as lessor
An acknowledgement by a lessee that a person who is not entitled to the
reversion expectant on a lease is the lessor has no effect on the person who is

acknowledge (by attornment or otherwise) the lessor as the lessor of the
land; or
(b)
take possession of the land.
(2)
If a lease contains a covenant that the lessee will not, or will not without the

(a)
re-entering the land peaceably (and without committing forcible entry
under section 91 of the Crimes Act 1961); or

However, if, without the consent of the transferor or assignor, the transferee or
assignee agrees with the lessor to vary the lease, the variation does not increase
the liability of the transferor or assignor beyond that provided for by the lease
at the time of the transfer or assignment.
(3)
Subsection (1) does not apply to a covenant that, immediately before the
transfer or assignment, was not binding on the lessee, or on the lessor, as the
case requires.
(4)
Subsection (2) does not apply if the lease provides for the variation.
242
Covenant implied in transfer or assignment of lease

date of the transfer or assignment, the transferee or assignee will—
(a)
pay the rent payable under the lease as and when it falls due; and
(b)
observe or perform every other covenant of the lessee; and

whose names and addresses are known to the lessor:

246
Cancellation of lease for breach of other covenants
(1)
A lessor may exercise a right to cancel a lease because of a breach of a
covenant or condition of the lease (except the covenant to pay rent) only if—
(a)
the lessor has served on the lessee a notice of intention to cancel the
lease; and
(b)
at the expiry of a period that is reasonable in the circumstances, the
breach has not been remedied.
(2)
The notice required by subsection (1)(a) must adequately inform the recipient
of all of the following matters:
(a)
the nature and extent of the breach complained about:
(b)
if the lessor considers that the breach is capable of being remedied by
the lessee doing or stopping from doing a particular thing, or by the
lessee paying reasonable compensation, or both,—
(i)
the thing that the lessee must do or stop doing; or
(ii)
the amount of compensation that the lessor considers reasonable;
and
(c)
the consequence that, if the breach is not remedied at the expiry of a
period that is reasonable in the circumstances, the lessor may seek to
cancel the lease in accordance with section 244:
(d)
the effect of section 247(1) and (2):
(e)
the right, under section 253, to apply to a court for relief against cancel‐
lation of the lease, and the advisability of seeking legal advice on the
exercise of that right.
Compare: Landlord and Tenant Act 1730, 4 Geo 2, c 28 s 2 (UK); 1952 No 51 s 118
247
Defects that do not invalidate notice of intention to cancel lease
(1)
The notice required by section 246(1)(a) is not invalid merely because the
lessor—
(a)
may not have specified that the breach is capable of being remedied by
the payment of reasonable compensation; or
(b)
may have specified an amount of compensation that is unreasonable; or
(c)
may have specified that the breach would be capable of being remedied
by the payment of reasonable compensation, but without specifying the
amount that the lessor considers reasonable.
(2)
None of the matters set out in subsection (1)(a) to (c) prevents a lessee from
offering an amount that the lessee considers to be reasonable compensation for
the breach.
(3)
For the purposes of this section and section 246(2)(b), reasonable compen‐
sation for the breach may include reimbursement of the lessor’s reasonable
expenses—

notice of intention to cancel lease

sion of the land comprised in a lease if—
(a)
a notice of intention to cancel the lease for breach of a covenant or
condition of the lease has been given under section 246(1)(a); and
(b)
the court finds that the application was made before the expiry of
the period that was reasonable in the circumstances for remedying the
breach.
(2)
The court may make the order sought by the application if satisfied that, at the
time when the order is made, a period that is reasonable in the circumstances
has expired and the breach has not been remedied.
(3)
This section overrides section 246.

(b)
any sublessee of the lease; and
(c)
any mortgagee or receiver of the estate or interest of a sublessee.

the lessor from exercising a right to cancel the lease.

250
Acceptance of rent by lessor after notice of intention to cancel lease given
not to operate as waiver of lessor’s rights
(1)
If a lessor accepts any rent after a notice of intention to cancel the lease
is served on the lessee in accordance with section 245 or 246 the lessor’s
acceptance of the rent does not operate as a waiver of the lessor’s right, on the
ground of a breach of a covenant or condition of the lease, to—
(a)
apply for an order for possession of the land; or
(b)
re-enter the land.

in doing anything else that the lessor has reasonably done in relation to
the breach.
Compare: Landlord and Tenant Act 1730, 4 Geo 2, c 28 s 2 (UK); 1952 No 51 s 118
252
Effect of sections 244 to 251

Sections 244 to 251 do not prevent a lessor from claiming damages for—
(a)
the breach of a lease; or
(b)
the breach of any other duty to the lessor that the lessee may be under
independently of the lease.
(2)
Sections 244 to 251 also do not affect the amount that the lessor may claim by
way of damages.

assess the damages or compensation to be paid to any person prejudi‐

(b)
a termination of the easement for part only of the land over which it was
granted (that is, a severance of the reversion as regards the estate).

As between a person (person A) entitled to enforce those implied covenants
and a person (person B) bound by them, a provision to which this subsection
applies must be taken as negativing, varying, or extending any of those implied
covenants only so long as the provision remains enforceable by person A
against person B.
(4)
Subsection (3) applies to a provision of an instrument, contract, or arrangement
coming into operation before 6 November 1986 (which is the date on which
section 126B of the Property Law Act 1952 was substituted by section 4 of the

(1)
This section applies to proposals, in a notice served under section 308 calling

work required to be done under the terms of a positive covenant, about—
(a)
the requirement to undertake or contribute to the cost of the work; and
(b)
the nature or extent of the work; and
(c)
the shares in which the cost of the work is to be borne; and
(d)
the need for entry onto the land of the person bound.
(2)

bound has not, within 15 working days after the date of service of the notice,
served on the person entitled a cross-notice specifying the proposals to which
the person bound objects.
(3)
The person bound may set out in that cross-notice, in the same detail required

311
Circumstances in which person bound is not liable
(1)
The person bound is not liable to contribute to the cost of any part of the

notice) and ending on the earlier of the following:
(a)
the time at which a cross-notice under section 310 (a cross-notice) was
duly served by the person bound on the person entitled:
(b)
the expiry of 15 working days after the date on which the notice was
duly served on the person bound (which is the period within which the
person bound may serve a cross-notice).
(2)
The person bound is not liable to contribute to the cost of any part of the
proposed work if that work is carried out in any period, after a notice and
a cross-notice have been duly served, during which differences between the
parties remain to be settled, either by agreement or by a court.
(3)
Neither subsection (1) nor (2) prevents the person bound from agreeing, in the
particular case, during the period referred to in that subsection, to contribute to
the cost of the proposed work.

or occupier for the time being of the benefited land may proceed with the
proposed work and recover from the person on whom the notice was served
under section 308 the share of the cost of the work that that person agreed or
was ordered by the court to contribute, even if that person has ceased to be an
owner or occupier of the burdened land.

time being of the burdened or the benefited land who was not a party to the
settlement, whether or not that person became, or ceased to be, an owner or
occupier of that land before, on, or after the date of the settlement.

circumstances that relief should be granted.
(3)
However, the court must not grant relief if the wrongly placed structure for
which relief is sought is a fence and all questions or disputes concerning it can
be resolved by an exercise of the jurisdiction conferred by section 24 of the
Fencing Act 1978.

that the person would otherwise have against any other person for any deliber‐
ate or negligent act or omission in relation to—

the extent to which any person has been unjustifiably enriched at the
expense of the person seeking relief because the owner of the land
affected has become the owner of the wrongly placed structure.
(2)
Subsection (1) does not prevent the court from granting relief merely because
the person seeking relief knew of the true boundaries or ownership of the land
affected at the time that the structure was placed there, or at the time when
that person became the owner of, or acquired an estate or interest in, the land
affected, the land intended, or the structure.

Subpart 6—Setting aside of dispositions that prejudice creditors
344
Purpose of this subpart
The purpose of this subpart is to enable a court to order that property acquired
or received under or through certain prejudicial dispositions made by a debtor
(or its value) be restored for the benefit of creditors (but without the order
having effect so as to increase the value of securities held by creditors over the
debtor’s property).
Compare: 1952 No 51 s 60
345
Interpretation
(1)
For the purposes of this subpart,—
(a)
a disposition of property prejudices a creditor if it hinders, delays, or
defeats the creditor in the exercise of any right of recourse of the creditor
in respect of the property; and
(b)
a disposition of property is not made with intent to prejudice a creditor if
it is made with the intention only of preferring one creditor over another;
