management of land and associated buildings and facilities on a socially and

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
or stratum estate in leasehold or licence by unit owners, and common
property that is owned by the body corporate on behalf of the unit
owners; and
(b)
to create bodies corporate, which comprise all unit owners in a develop‐
ment, to operate and manage unit title developments; and
(c)
to establish a flexible and responsive regime for the governance of unit
title developments; and
(d)
to protect the integrity of the development as a whole.

Overview
(1)
This Act provides for the following matters:
Preliminary provisions
(a)
Part 1 sets out the purpose of the Act and its application, and defines
terms used in the Act:
Creation of unit title developments
(b)
subparts 1 to 6 of Part 2 deal with the creation of unit title developments
and related matters, in particular—
(i)
land and buildings may be subdivided into a unit title develop‐
ment by the deposit of a unit plan by the Registrar-General of
Land:
(ii)
a unit title development consists of separate units and common
property (the common property being the remainder of the land
(or building) that is for the use of all the unit owners):
(iii)
units are either principal units or accessory units:
(iv)
principal units may be places of residence or business (for
example, shops) or for other uses:
(v)
accessory units are designed for use with a principal unit (for
example, a garage or car parking space):
(vi)
the legal title that is created in the units is a different estate from
the legal title to the underlying land on which the development is
built:
(vii)
the bundle of legal rights applying to the unit is called a stratum
estate:
(viii) a principal unit in a unit title development (for example, a build‐
ing or part of a building) and its accessory unit may be further
subdivided to create another unit title development (this creates a
layered unit title development (see section 20 and the illustrations
in examples 2 and 3 in Schedule 1)):
Part 1 s 4

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(ix)
each unit is assigned an ownership interest and a utility interest
and that is relevant to the calculation of many of the unit owner’s
rights under the Act:
(x)
a unit title development may be created in stages, with successive
plans deposited by the Registrar-General of Land as the develop‐
ment progresses:
Dealings with unit title developments
(c)
subparts 7 to 11 of Part 2 concern dealings with various parts of the unit
title development, in particular—
(i)
principal units in a unit title development may be bought and sold
individually:
(ii)
accessory units are bought and sold with the principal units to
which they relate (although they may be transferred between prin‐
cipal unit owners of the unit title development):
(iii)
the common property is owned by the body corporate that admin‐
isters the unit title development, and the unit owners have a bene‐
ficial interest:
(iv)
the body corporate has the ability to deal with the common prop‐
erty in various ways, for example, selling or leasing it or creating
easements and covenants affecting it:

Before a unit plan is deposited under section 17(1), 21(1), or 24(2)(a), the
registered proprietor or owner (as the case may be) must assign—
(a)
an ownership interest to every principal unit and every accessory unit;
and
(b)
a proposed ownership interest to every proposed principal unit and every
proposed accessory unit.
(2)
The ownership interest or proposed ownership interest assigned to a unit is that
assessed by a registered valuer on the basis of the value of the unit relative to
each other unit and shown on the documentation required to be lodged—
(a)
with the unit plan (in the case of a unit plan deposited under section
17(1) or 21(1)); or
(b)
with the proposed unit development plan (in the case of a stage unit plan
or complete unit plan deposited under section 24(2)).
(3)
The ownership interest is used to determine a range of matters, including, but
not limited to,—
(a)
the beneficial interest of the owner of the principal unit in the common
property:
(b)
the share of the owner of the principal unit in the value of any buildings,
fixtures, and other improvements in relation to leasehold land:
(c)
the voting rights of the owner of the principal unit when a poll is
requested under section 99:

the extent of the obligation of the owner of the principal unit in respect
of contributions levied by the body corporate under section 121 in
respect of any capital improvement fund:

The proposed ownership interest for a future development unit is the total
of all the proposed ownership interests of the proposed principal units and pro‐
posed accessory units in the future development unit assigned under subsection
(1)(b).
(5)
The proposed ownership interest is used to determine the same range of matters
described in subsection (3) in so far as they apply to an owner of a future
development unit.
(6)
After a unit plan is deposited, the ownership interest or proposed ownership
interest of a unit may be reassessed, and the new interest assigned to the unit,
as set out in this Act.

registered proprietor or owner (as the case may be) must assign a utility interest
to every principal unit and every accessory unit.
(2)
The utility interest assigned to a unit is the same as the ownership interest
assessed for the unit under section 38(2).
(2A) Alternatively, the registered proprietor or owner may assign to a unit a different
utility interest if that different utility interest is—
(a)
fair and equitable, in the view of the registered proprietor or owner,
having regard to the relevant benefits and the costs to units; and
(b)
shown on the documentation lodged with the unit plan.
(2B) A utility interest assignment for the purposes of subsection (2A) may be—
(a)
a single uniform interest; or
(b)
a multiple set of interests,—
(i)
each targeted at a particular service or amenity; and
(ii)
which may be, for a specific interest targeted at a particular ser‐
vice or amenity, assigned to some units only.

acquired (whether by operation of law or otherwise) the reversionary
estate in the whole of the base land.

if all the registered owners of the stratum estates in leasehold in all of
the units shown on the plan have purchased or acquired the reversionary
estate in the base land, the stratum estate in freehold in each of the units

Procedure where caveat lodged
(1)
If a caveat has been lodged under section 195(3) and the caveator has not
consented to the deposit of a unit plan for the purposes of section 197(2), the
company or any owner may serve notice on the caveator requiring the caveator,
within 3 months from the date of the service of the notice, either to consent to
the plan or to apply to the High Court for an order directing that the caveat not
be removed.
(2)
If the caveator fails to apply to the High Court for an order within the 3-month
period, and to consent, the caveator is to be treated as having consented to the
unit plan.
(3)
On application to the High Court by a caveator under this section, the High
Court may—
(a)
direct that the caveat not be removed; or
(b)
direct that the caveat be removed either immediately or on compliance
with any conditions as the High Court may specify.

Consents to deposit of plan

Despite anything in section 32(1)(d), the consent of any person other than the
company or a member of the company or an owner is not required to the
Version as at
9 May 2024
Unit Titles Act 2010
Part 4 s 197
131

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
deposit of the new unit plan if the Registrar is satisfied that every person, other
than a member of the company or an owner, who has any registered estate or
interest in the land in the scheme, or in any part of that land, and who does
not sign the plan, has been given proper notice under section 195 and has not
lodged a caveat under that section.
(2)
If any person, having lodged a caveat pursuant to section 195, consents to the
new unit plan, and the caveat is still in force at the time, the consent to the
plan has the effect of removing the caveat, and the Registrar must mark the
Registrar’s records accordingly.
(3)
No unit plan may be deposited unless every member of the company or the
owner, or the owner’s agent duly authorised in writing, and every person
having security over any unit shown on the plan under any mortgage or charge
to which section 198(2) relates consents to the deposit, but the Registrar may
dispense with the consent if the Registrar—
(a)
is satisfied that it would not be reasonable in any particular circum‐
stances to insist on the consent to the deposit of the plan; and
(b)
has no reason to believe that the plan does not correctly define the unit
of that member or owner.
(4)
If any person whose consent is required to the deposit of the new unit plan
is dead or cannot be found or refuses to consent or does not consent within a
reasonable time or if for any reason it is impracticable to obtain the consent
of that person, the High Court, on the application of any applicant under this
subpart, may if it thinks fit consent on behalf of that person to the deposit of
the plan.

198
Mortgages and charges to be discharged before deposit of unit plan
(1)
No unit plan may be deposited under this subpart while the land to which it
relates or any part of that land is subject to any mortgage or charge unless the
mortgage or charge relates to no land shown on the plan other than a proposed
unit or units in respect of which (under section 43(2)) the Registrar has been
requested at the time when the plan is deposited to create a separate record of
title.
(2)
If a unit plan is deposited in accordance with subsection (1) while there is a
mortgage or charge over the unit or units for which (under section 43(2)) the
Registrar is requested to create a separate record of title, the deposit of the plan
and the creation of the record of title does not affect the mortgage or charge;
and if, on the creation of the separate record of title, the stratum estate in the
unit or units is subject to the mortgage or charge, then the mortgage or charge
must be notified on the record of title in a manner so as to preserve its priority.

Effect of deposit of unit plan
(1)
On the deposit of a unit plan under this subpart, the stratum estate in each
unit vests in the person who, immediately before the plan was deposited, was
the holder of shares in the company entitling him or her to the exclusive
occupation of that unit, or the lessee under a lease of that unit from the owners
to himself or herself. The stratum estate may then devolve or be transferred,
leased, mortgaged, settled, or otherwise dealt with as provided in this Act.
(2)
On the deposit by a company of a unit plan, the company, if it is a company
within the meaning of section 2 of the Companies Act 1993, is deemed to have
been removed from the New Zealand register and that Act ceases to apply to it.
(3)
On the deposit, whether by a company or by the owners, of a unit plan in
accordance with this subpart,—
(a)
every certificate relating to shares in the company, and every copy of
every registered or unregistered lease or licence granted by the company
to one of its members or granted by the owners to one of them, is of no
further effect:
(b)
except as otherwise provided in this section, all property, rights, powers,
claims, and remedies belonging to the company, or to the owners as
registered owners of the base land, immediately before the deposit of the
plan, vests in the registered owners in accordance with this Act:
(c)
all existing liabilities of the company (except liability to its members in
respect of share capital), or of the owners as registered owners of the
base land, whether certain or contingent, must be transferred to and be
borne by the body corporate:
(d)
except so far as they are altered or modified expressly or by necessary
implication by reason of the deposit of the unit plan under this Act,
the rights, interests, duties, obligations, and liabilities of the members of
the company existing in relation to the company immediately before its
dissolution continue in existence in relation to the body corporate and
must not be otherwise affected or abated by the dissolution:
(e)
all acts, matters, and things of a continuing nature made, done, or com‐
menced by or on behalf of the company and immediately before its
dissolution of any force or effect or capable of acquiring any force or
effect are deemed to have been done or commenced by or on behalf of
the body corporate:
(f)
any reference to the company in any document or instrument must, if not
inconsistent with the context or subject-matter, be read as a reference to
the body corporate.

Creation of record of title in respect of units
(1)
On the deposit of the unit plan, the Registrar must—
(a)
cancel the record of title to the base land; and
(b)
create a record of title for the stratum estate to which the person who
will be the owner of each principal unit is entitled in that unit and any
accessory unit.
(2)
Every record of title created under subsection (1) is deemed to be a record of
title created under the Land Transfer Act 2017 and, subject to the provisions of
this Act, the provisions of that Act apply accordingly.
(3)
If the record of title created under subsection (1) relates to a unit in respect of
which there was, before the plan was deposited, a registered lease or licence,
the provisions of section 95(3) to (5) of the Land Transfer Act 2017 apply
to the record of title for that unit as if it were a lease in substitution for a
previously registered lease.
(4)
The provisions of section 7(2) and (3) of the Joint Family Homes Act 1964
apply in every case where a record of title is created under subsection (1) in
respect of a unit that was settled as a joint family home immediately before the
deposit of the new unit plan relating to that unit.
