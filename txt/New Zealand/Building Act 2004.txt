in a case where a compliance schedule is required as a result
of the building work, the specified systems in the building are
capable of performing to the performance standards set out in the

is required as a result of the building work, the specified systems
that are being altered in, or added to, the building in the course of
the building work are capable of performing to the performance
standards set out in the building consent.
(2)
In deciding whether to issue a code compliance certificate, a building consent
authority—

must accept a current manufacturer’s certificate for a modular compo‐
nent accompanying the application under section 92(3) or (3A) as estab‐
lishing that the building work to which the certificate applies complies

relation to which a warning or ban under section 26(2) is in force has,
or may have, been used or applied in the building work to which the
certificate would relate.
(3)
If the owner fails to provide to a building consent authority an energy work
certificate in relation to energy work in respect of which a building consent has

that relate to how a building is likely to perform in an earthquake; and
(b)
that would be used to design a new building on the same site; and
(c)
as they apply on the day on which this section comes into force.
(2)
The earthquake rating of a building or a part of a building—
(a)
is determined by a territorial authority in accordance with the EPB
methodology (see section 133AK); and
(b)
is specified on the EPB notice issued for the building or part and recor‐
ded in the EPB register; and
(c)
determines the form of the EPB notice issued for the building or part

(2)
A building consent authority must not grant a building consent for the altera‐
tion of the building or part unless the building consent authority is satisfied
that,—
(a)
after the alteration, the building will comply, as nearly as is reasonably
practicable, with the provisions of the building code that relate to—
(i)
means of escape from fire; and
(ii)
access and facilities for persons with disabilities (if this is a
requirement in terms of section 118); and
(b)
after the alteration, the building will,—
(i)
if it complied with the other provisions of the building code
immediately before the building work began, continue to comply
with those provisions; or
(ii)
if it did not comply with the other provisions of the building code
immediately before the building work began, continue to comply
at least to the same extent as it did then comply; and
(c)
in the case of a substantial alteration, the alteration includes the neces‐
sary seismic work. An alteration of a building is a substantial alteration
if the territorial authority is satisfied that the alteration meets criteria
prescribed under section 401C(c).
(3)
Despite subsection (2)(a), a territorial authority may, by written notice to the
owner of the building or part, specify 1 or more of the provisions of the
building code referred to in subsection (2)(a) and allow the alteration of the
building or part without the building complying with the specified provisions if
the territorial authority is satisfied that—
(a)
the alteration includes the necessary seismic work; and

(b)
if the building were required to comply with the specified provisions, it
would be unduly onerous for the owner in the circumstances; and
(c)
the permitted non-compliance with the specified provisions is no more
than is reasonably necessary in the light of the objective of ensuring that
the building or part is no longer earthquake prone; and
(d)
after the alteration, the building will continue to comply with the speci‐
fied provisions, and other provisions of the building code, to at least the
same extent as it complied with those provisions immediately before the
building work began.
(4)
When making the assessments required by subsection (3)(b) and (c), the terri‐
torial authority must take into account the matters (if any) prescribed under
section 401C(d).

actions should result in minimal restriction of the ability of an owner or
occupier to continue to use and occupy property and any restriction of
that ability should be for no longer than is reasonably necessary:

decisions should be based on—
(i)
up-to-date information, including information about the possible
occurrence of further emergencies or other relevant events and
other changes in the type and severity of risks arising from an
emergency:
(ii)
information about possible future events.

133BU Owner directed to give information
(1)
A responsible person may direct the owner of a building or of any land in a
designated area to give the responsible person information about the building

133BV Urgent works to remove or reduce risks
(1)
This section applies if a responsible person believes that works in relation to a
building in a designated area—
(a)
are reasonably necessary to remove or reduce risks posed by the build‐
ing; and
(b)
must be carried out without delay in order to remove or reduce those
risks.
(2)
The responsible person may carry out those works.
(3)
The responsible person (if not the Minister) must obtain the approval of the
Minister before carrying out works that involve the demolition of the whole or
a part of a heritage building that is—
(a)
identified as Category 1 or wāhi tūpuna in the list referred to in para‐
graph (a)(i) of the definition of heritage building in section 7; or
(b)
referred to in paragraph (a)(ii) of that definition.
(4)
A responsible person who requests the approval of the Minister under subsec‐
tion (3) must at the same time notify Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga of
the request.
(5)
The Minister must consult the Minister responsible for the administration of
the Heritage New Zealand Pouhere Taonga Act 2014 at least 24 hours before—

reference to the responsible person; and

accordance with subsection (4), (5), or (6) does not invalidate the Minister’s
approval or the responsible person’s decision to carry out works.
(10)
In this section, risk means a risk to—
(a)
persons, of injury or death; or
(b)
critical infrastructure, of damage or disruption to its operation or use.
Example
A building that is not a heritage building has been damaged by an earthquake.
The responsible person believes that, if works to prop and brace the walls of the
building are not carried out without delay, the building might collapse and, because
of the building’s location, cause death or injury. So this section applies and the
responsible person may carry out the works.

posed by the building; and
(b)
section 133BV(1)(b) does not apply; and
(c)
there will be ongoing disruption of a public thoroughfare or of the use
of another building or of critical infrastructure because the responsible
person has—
(i)
put in place measures under section 133BS or placed 1 or more

(ii)
decided that those measures, signs, or notices must remain in

Before deciding to carry out works in relation to a building, or to direct that
they be carried out, the responsible person must,—
(a)
at least 10 working days before deciding, seek and consider the views of
the following persons if it is reasonably practicable to do so:
(i)
the owner of the building:
(ii)
the occupiers of the building:
(iii)
owners and occupiers of other buildings, and owners and oper‐
ators of critical infrastructure, whose use is disrupted by the meas‐
ures put in place under section 133BS or by the signs or notices
placed under section 133BT:
(iv)
persons who have an interest in the land on which the building is
situated under a mortgage or other encumbrance registered under
the Land Transfer Act 2017:
(v)
persons who have an interest in that land that is protected by a
caveat lodged and in force under section 138 of the Land Transfer

neighbouring homes and businesses, of not carrying out the works.
(4)

If a responsible person carries out the works,—
(a)

by—
(i)
the person who designated the area; or
(ii)
another person (if any) who can extend the designation of the area

(10)
A person who intentionally fails to comply with a direction under subsection
(2)(b)—
(a)
commits an offence; and
(b)
is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $200,000.
Example
A building that is not a heritage building has been damaged by an earthquake. The
responsible person believes that works to prop and brace the walls of the building
are necessary to remove or reduce the risk of the building collapsing but need not
be carried out immediately. In the meantime, the responsible person prohibits entry
to the building and also an adjacent building by exercising powers under section
133BS or 133BT. Until the works are completed, use of the 2 buildings will be
disrupted. So this section applies and the responsible person may carry out the
works or direct the building owner to do so.

is liable on conviction to a fine not exceeding $200,000.
Example
A building that is not a heritage building has been damaged by an earthquake.
Urgent works are not required and re-entry to the building need not be prohibited.
However, the responsible person believes that works on a damaged wall are
necessary to make the building safe, sanitary, and otherwise suitable for long-term
use or occupation. So this section applies and the responsible person may direct
the building owner to carry out the works.

(a)
that the act that constituted the offence took place with that person’s
authority, permission, or consent; and
(b)
that he or she knew or could reasonably be expected to have known
that the offence was to be or was being committed and failed to take all
reasonable steps to prevent or stop it.

Liability for acts of employees or agents of Crown organisations
(1)
Section 386 does not apply if a person acting as agent or employee of a Crown
organisation commits an offence under this Act.
(2)
If an offence referred to in section 6(1)(a) of the Crown Organisations (Crim‐
inal Liability) Act 2002 is committed by a person acting as the agent or
employee of a Crown organisation, the Crown organisation must (without
affecting the personal liability of the agent or employee) be treated for all legal
purposes as having committed that offence.
(3)
Despite subsection (2), if proceedings for an offence referred to in section
6(1)(a) of the Crown Organisations (Criminal Liability) Act 2002 are brought
against a Crown organisation in reliance on subsection (2), it is a good defence
if the Crown organisation proves that—
(a)
the organisation took all reasonable steps to remedy any effects of the act
or omission constituting the offence; and
(b)
either—
(i)
no person involved in the management of the organisation knew
or could reasonably be expected to have known that the offence
was to be or was being committed; or
(ii)
the organisation took all reasonable steps to prevent the commis‐
sion of the offence.
(4)
If a Crown organisation is convicted of an offence against this Act, the chief
executive or principal officer (however described) of the organisation and
every person concerned in the management of the organisation is guilty of the
same offence if it is proved—
(a)
that the act that constituted the offence took place with that person’s
authority, permission, or consent; and
(b)
that he or she knew or could reasonably be expected to have known
that the offence was to be or was being committed and failed to take all
reasonable steps to prevent or stop it.

Strict liability and defences
(1)
Except as otherwise provided in this Act, in a prosecution for an offence of
contravening or permitting a contravention of this Act, it is not necessary to
prove that the defendant intended to commit the offence.
(2)
It is a defence in any prosecution that is referred to in subsection (1) if the
defendant proves—
(a)
that all of the following circumstances apply:
(i)
the action or event to which the prosecution relates was necessary
for the purposes of saving or protecting life or health, or prevent‐
ing serious damage to property; and
(ii)
the conduct of the defendant was reasonable in the circumstances;
and
(iii)
the effects of the action or event were adequately mitigated or
remedied by the defendant after it occurred; or
(b)
that the action or event to which the prosecution relates was due to an
event beyond the control of the defendant, including natural disaster,
mechanical failure, or sabotage, and in each case—
(i)
the action or event could not reasonably have been foreseen or
been provided against by the defendant; and
(ii)
the effects of the action or event were adequately mitigated or
remedied by the defendant after it occurred.

Fines to be paid to territorial authority or regional authority instituting
prosecution
(1)
A court must order that a fine imposed on any person in relation to the person’s
conviction for an offence under this Act be paid to the territorial authority or,
as the case may be, the regional authority that commenced the proceedings for
that offence.
(2)
However, an amount equal to 10% of every amount payable to the territorial
authority or the regional authority under subsection (1) must be credited to a
Crown Bank Account nominated by the Minister of Finance for the purposes of
this subsection.
(3)
If any money awarded by a court in respect of loss or damage is recovered as
a fine, and that fine is ordered to be paid to a territorial authority or a regional
authority under subsection (1), no deduction is to be made under subsection (2)
in respect of that money.
(4)
An order of the court made under subsection (1) is sufficient authority for the
Registrar receiving payment of the fine to—
(a)
pay 10% of the fine to the Crown in accordance with subsection (2); and

(b)

authority entitled to it under the order.
(5)
Nothing in section 73 of the Public Finance Act 1989 applies to a fine ordered
to be paid to a territorial authority or a regional authority under subsection (1).
(6)

were commenced by a person other than a territorial authority or a regional
authority.

Interpretation
In this Part,—
amendment Act means the Building (Earthquake-prone Buildings) Amend‐
ment Act 2016
commencement date means the day on which section 24 of the amendment
Act (which inserts subpart 6A of Part 2) comes into force.
Schedule 1AA clause 1: amended, on 7 September 2022, by section 98(1) of the Building (Building
Products and Methods, Modular Components, and Other Matters) Amendment Act 2021 (2021
No 21).
2
Notices given under section 124 before commencement date
(1)
This clause applies to a building or a part of a building if, before the com‐
mencement date, a territorial authority issued a written notice under section
124(2)(c)(i) (the old notice) requiring work to be carried out on the building
or part, by a deadline stated in the old notice (the old deadline), to reduce or
remove the danger associated with the building or part being earthquake prone
(the seismic work).
(2)
If subpart 6A of Part 2 does not apply to the building (see section 133AA),—
(a)
the old notice is revoked on the commencement date; and
(b)
the territorial authority must notify the owner of the building of that fact.
(3)
If subpart 6A of Part 2 does apply to the building,—
(a)
the territorial authority is deemed to have determined that the building or
the part of the building is earthquake prone; and
Schedule 1AA
Building Act 2004
Version as at
26 November 2024
418

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
(b)
the territorial authority need not determine the earthquake rating of the
building or part; and
(c)
the territorial authority must, as soon as practicable after the commence‐
ment date,—
(i)
issue an EPB notice for the building or the part of the building
under section 133AL; and
(ii)
record the details of the building or the part of the building in the
EPB register and update other information in the EPB register as
necessary (but the territorial authority need not record the earth‐
quake rating of the building or part); and
(d)
the deadline for completing the seismic work is determined as follows:
(i)
if the old deadline is earlier than the deadline calculated under
section 133AM(2), the deadline for completing the seismic work
is the old deadline (subject to subclause (5)); and
(ii)
if the old deadline is on or after the deadline calculated under
section 133AM(2), the deadline for completing the seismic work
is the deadline calculated under section 133AM(2); and
(e)
until the territorial authority issues an EPB notice, the old notice must be
treated as if it were an EPB notice issued under this Act.
(4)
To avoid doubt, for the purpose of subclause (3)(d) the deadline calculated
under section 133AM(2) is the expiry of the relevant period as measured from
the date of the EPB notice and not from the date of the old notice.
(5)
If an old deadline is preserved by subclause (3)(d)(i) but the period given for
completing the seismic work under the old notice is shorter than the relevant
period specified in section 133AM(2) (for example, an old notice issued for
a building in an area of medium seismic risk required the owner to complete
seismic work within 20 years after the date of that notice, but the period
specified in section 133AM(2) that is relevant to the building is 25 years),—
(a)
the owner of the building or the part of the building may apply to
the territorial authority to have the relevant period specified in section
133AM(2) applied retrospectively to the date of the old notice (which
would have the effect of extending the deadline for completing the
seismic work); and
(b)
in deciding whether to grant the application, the territorial authority must
have regard to the particular circumstances and any guidance issued by
the chief executive under section 175 for that purpose; and
(c)
if the territorial authority grants the application, the deadline is the
expiry of the relevant period specified in section 133AM(2), as mea‐
sured from the date of the old notice and not from the date of the EPB
notice.

(6)
If a territorial authority grants an application under subclause (5), the territorial
authority must—
(a)
issue or reissue (as applicable) an EPB notice for the building or part
under section 133AL; and
(b)
record the details of the decision in the EPB register and update other
information in the EPB register as necessary.
3
Policy adopted under section 131 before commencement date
(1)
This clause applies to a policy under section 131 (policy on dangerous, earth‐
quake-prone, and insanitary buildings) that is adopted by a territorial authority
before the commencement date.
(2)
To the extent that the policy applies to earthquake-prone buildings, the policy
ceases to apply on the commencement date.
(3)
As soon as is reasonably practicable after the commencement date, the terri‐
torial authority must amend or replace the policy to remove references to
earthquake-prone buildings.
(4)
Section 132 applies to an amendment or a replacement made under subclause
(3), except that the special consultative procedure in section 83 of the Local
Government Act 2002 (see section 132(2)) does not apply unless the amend‐
ment or replacement materially affects the policy as it applies to dangerous and
insanitary buildings.
4
Effect of certain references to parts of buildings
The fact that provisions added to this Act by the amendment Act refer separ‐
ately to buildings and parts of buildings does not limit or affect any other
provision of this Act in terms of how that provision applies in respect of parts
of buildings.
