General
This is a reprint of the Land Valuation Proceedings Fees Regu-
lations 1991. The reprint incorporates all the amendments to
the regulations as at 1 July 2013, as specified in the list of
amendments at the end of these notes.
Relevant provisions of any amending enactments that contain
transitional, savings, or application provisions that cannot be
compiled in the reprint are also included, after the principal
enactment, in chronological order. For more information, see
http://www.pco.parliament.govt.nz/reprints/.
2
Status of reprints
Under section 16D of the Acts and Regulations Publication
Act 1989, reprints are presumed to correctly state, as at the
date of the reprint, the law enacted by the principal enactment
and by the amendments to that enactment. This presumption
applies even though editorial changes authorised by section
17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989 have
been made in the reprint.
This presumption may be rebutted by producing the official
volumes of statutes or statutory regulations in which the prin-
cipal enactment and its amendments are contained.
3
How reprints are prepared
A number of editorial conventions are followed in the prep-
aration of reprints. For example, the enacting words are not
included in Acts, and provisions that are repealed or revoked

and Statutory Regulations and Deemed Regulations in Force.

Changes made under section 17C of the Acts and
Regulations Publication Act 1989
Section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989
authorises the making of editorial changes in a reprint as set
out in sections 17D and 17E of that Act so that, to the extent
permitted, the format and style of the reprinted enactment is
consistent with current legislative drafting practice. Changes
that would alter the effect of the legislation are not permitted.
A new format of legislation was introduced on 1 January 2000.
Changes to legislative drafting style have also been made since
1997, and are ongoing. To the extent permitted by section 17C
of the Acts and Regulations Publication Act 1989, all legisla-
tion reprinted after 1 January 2000 is in the new format for
legislation and reflects current drafting practice at the time of
the reprint.
In outline, the editorial changes made in reprints under the au-
thority of section 17C of the Acts and Regulations Publication
Act 1989 are set out below, and they have been applied, where
relevant, in the preparation of this reprint:
•
omission of unnecessary referential words (such as “of
this section” and “of this Act”)
•
typeface and type size (Times Roman, generally in 11.5
point)
•
layout of provisions, including:
•
indentation
•
position of section headings (eg, the number and
heading now appear above the section)
•
format of definitions (eg, the defined term now appears
in bold type, without quotation marks)
•
format of dates (eg, a date formerly expressed as “the
1st day of January 1999” is now expressed as “1 January
1999”)

Notes
•
position of the date of assent (it now appears on the front
page of each Act)
•
punctuation (eg, colons are not used after definitions)
•
Parts numbered with roman numerals are replaced with
arabic numerals, and all cross-references are changed
accordingly
•
case and appearance of letters and words, including:
•
format of headings (eg, headings where each
word formerly appeared with an initial cap-
ital letter followed by small capital letters are
amended so that the heading appears in bold,
with only the first word (and any proper nouns)
appearing with an initial capital letter)
•
small capital letters in section and subsection ref-
erences are now capital letters
•
schedules are renumbered (eg, Schedule 1 replaces First
Schedule), and all cross-references are changed accord-
ingly
•
running heads (the information that appears at the top
of each page)
•
format of two-column schedules of consequential
amendments, and schedules of repeals (eg, they are
rearranged into alphabetical order, rather than chrono-
logical).
