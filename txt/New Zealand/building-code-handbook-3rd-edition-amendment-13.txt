Preface
1.0 	 INTRODUCTION
1.1 This preface provides an introduction  
to building controls in New Zealand. This 
section shows the relationship between the 
New Zealand Building Code (the Building Code) 
and various other Provisions that ensure buildings 
in New Zealand are safe and healthy to use. 
1.2 The preface provides a convenient user 
reference. However, legal interpretation must 
be based on the actual wording of the Building 
Act 2004 (the Building Act), and amendments  
and respective Building Regulations.
2.0 	 BUILDING CONTROL FRAMEWORK
The regulation and performance of buildings 
sits under the following three-part framework.
•	 The Building Act, which contains the 
provisions for regulating building work.
•	 The various Building Regulations, which 
contain prescribed forms, list specified 
systems, define ‘change the use’ and 
‘moderate earthquake’, and set out the  
rate of levy and fees for determinations.
•	 The Building Code, contained in Schedule 1 
of the Building Regulations 1992, which sets 
performance standards all new building work 
must meet, and covers aspects such as 
stability, protection from fire, access, 
moisture, safety of users, services and 
facilities, and energy efficiency.
The pyramid below illustrates the legislation 
that forms the building control framework 
governed by the Building Act.

2.1	
The Building Act 2004
The Building Act provides the mandatory 
framework for the building control system  
to be followed when undertaking building  
work in New Zealand. It applies to all:
•	 buildings including Crown buildings, except 
those which may be exempt for reasons of 
national security
•	 components in a building, including 
plumbing, electrical and mechanical 
installations.
The Building Act should be read taking into 
account the changes under the Building 
Amendment Act 2005 and any subsequent 
amendments (copies are on www.legislation.
govt.nz).
2.1.1	 Purpose
The Building Act aims to improve control of and 
encourage better practices in building design 
and construction to provide greater assurance 
to consumers.
This means:
•	 more clarity on the standards we expect 
buildings to meet
•	 more guidance on how these standards  
can be met
•	 more certainty that capable people are 
undertaking building design, construction  
and inspection
•	 more scrutiny in the building consent and 
inspection process
•	 better protection for homeowners through 
the introduction of mandatory warranties.
The purpose of the Building Act is:
•	 to provide for regulation of building work
•	 to ensure that people can use buildings 
safely without endangering their health
•	 to ensure people can escape a building  
in case of fire
• 	to ensure buildings have attributes that 
contribute appropriately to the health, 
physical independence and wellbeing  
of the people who use them
• 	to ensure buildings are designed, 
constructed and able to be used in ways  
that promote sustainable development.
2.1.2	Principles
The Building Act does not contain an equivalent 
to section 47 of the Building Act 1991 (the 
former Act), which contained guidance on how 
a territorial authority should exercise its powers. 
Under section 4 of the Building Act (section 6 
under the former Act), principles to be applied 
in performing functions or duties, or exercising 
powers under the Building Act, now have 
greater importance. Section 4 should be taken 
into account when performing functions, duties 
or exercising powers relating to the granting  
of waivers or modifications of the Building 
Code, and the adoption and review of policies 
on dangerous, earthquake-prone or insanitary 
buildings.
The Building Act re-states many of the 
principles outlined in the former Act, and makes 
explicit some of the implied principles of that 
legislation (for example, that innovation is 
important). However, some significant new 
concepts have been introduced, including a 
particular focus on the household unit, as well 
as considering the whole-of-life costs of 
building work.
The following is a summary of the Building  
Act principles.
•	 Household units have an important role  
in the lives of the people who use them,  
and are accorded a special focus. 
•	 The Building Code as it relates to household 
units is important, and household units need 
to comply with the Building Code. 
•	 Maintenance requirements of household 
units need to be reasonable, and owners  
of household units need to be aware of the 
maintenance requirements of their  
household units. 
•	 Harmful effects on human health resulting 
from the use of building methods, products, 
design or building work need to be prevented 
or minimised.

Preface
5
•	 Buildings need to be durable. 
•	 Special traditional and cultural aspects  
of the intended use of a building need  
to be recognised. 
•	 The whole-of-life costs of a building need  
to be considered. 
•	 Standards are important in achieving 
compliance with the Building Code for 
building design and construction. 
•	 Innovation in methods of building design  
and construction is important. 
•	 People who undertake a rescue operation  
or firefighting in a building need to be able  
to expect a reasonable level of protection 
from injury or illness while doing so. 
•	 The extent and effects of the spread  
of fire need to be limited to protect other 
household units and other property. 
•	 Other property needs to be protected  
from physical damage resulting from  
the construction, use and demolition  
of a building. 
•	 People with disabilities need to be able  
to enter and carry out normal activities  
and processes in a building. 
•	 Buildings of significant cultural, historical  
or heritage value need to be preserved. 
•	 Energy use in buildings needs to be efficient. 
•	 The use of renewable sources of energy 
needs to be encouraged. 
•	 Material use in buildings needs to be efficient 
and sustainable. 
•	 Water use in buildings needs to be efficient 
and promote water conservation. 
•	 Waste generated during the construction 
process needs to be reduced. 
•	 Owners, designers, builders and building 
consent authorities each need to be 
accountable for their role in obtaining 
consents and approvals, ensuring plans and 
specifications for building work will meet the 
Building Code, and ensuring work complies 
with the building consent or, where a building 
consent is not required, complies with the 
Building Code.
2.1.3	Application
The Building Act applies to:
• 	building construction, alteration, demolition 
or removal
• 	maintenance of a building’s specified 
systems, such as lifts and fire protection 
installations.
The Building Act does not cover:
•	 planning and resource management
•	 occupational safety and health.
2.1.4	Structure
The Building Act has five parts.
Part 1: Contains the purpose and principles  
of the Building Act, together with an overview, 
commencement dates for various Provisions 
and definitions. These sections provide an 
important reference when reading and 
interpreting the Building Act.
Part 2 (and Schedules 1 and 2): Outlines 
matters relating to the Building Code and 
building control (such as building consents), 
including requirements of building work, 
requirements for the use of buildings,  
Provisions for certain categories of buildings  
and Provisions for the safety of dams.
Part 3: Sets out the functions, duties  
and powers of the Chief Executive of the 
Department of Building and Housing  
(the Department), territorial authorities,  
regional authorities and building consent 
authorities. It also deals with the accreditation 
and registration of building consent authorities, 
accreditation of dam owners, and product 
certification. 
Part 4 (and Schedule 3): Covers matters 
relating to the licensing and disciplining of 
building practitioners.
Part 5 (and Schedule 4): Describes 
miscellaneous matters, including offences  
and criminal proceedings, implied terms  
of contracts, regulation-making powers, 
amendments to other enactments and the 
repeal of the former Act, and the transitional 
Provisions from the former Act to the  
Building Act.

2.2	
Building Regulations  
Building Regulations are made under and in 
accordance with the Building Act. 
A number of regulations have been made under 
the Building Act. Currently (as at May 2007) 
there are seven sets of regulations. 
1.	 Building Regulations 1992, made under 
the former Act and which include the 
Building Code. These regulations have been 
amended by the Building (Forms) 
Regulations 2004 so that only certain parts 
remain in force. Parts still in force are: 
Schedule 1 (Building Code), Regulation 3, 
Forms 16 & 17 (and Regulation 4 and 
Schedule 2 where they relate to  
these forms).

regulations outline and define the  
following terms.
	
•	 Specified systems – the building systems 	
	
that must be listed on compliance schedules 	
	
and are subject to specific inspection and 	
	
maintenance procedures. Schedule 1 	
	
provides the list of specified systems.
	
•	 Change the use – to determine when  
	
a change in a building’s use will require

2.3	
The New Zealand Building Code
The Building Code is contained in Schedule 1  
of the Building Regulations 1992. The Building 
Code contains compulsory rules for all new 
building work. 
2.3.1	Content
The Building Code sets out performance criteria 
that building work must meet. It covers aspects 
such as structural stability, fire safety, access, 
moisture control, durability, services and 
facilities, and energy efficiency. 
The Building Code does not prescribe how work 
should be done, but states how completed 
building work and its parts must perform.
An advantage of a performance-based Building 
Code is flexibility. It contains no prescriptive 
requirements stipulating that certain products 
or designs must be used. This flexibility allows 
developments and innovation in building design, 
technology and systems. 
2.3.2	Structure
The Building Code consists of two preliminary 
clauses and 37 technical clauses. Each technical 
clause has three levels that describe the 
requirements for the clause and is listed below.
1.	Objective Social objectives the building 
must achieve.
2.	Functional requirement Functions the 	
building must perform to meet the Objective. 
3.	Performance The performance criteria the 
building must 	achieve. By meeting the 
performance criteria, the Objective and 
Functional requirement can be achieved.

3.0 	 COMPLIANCE PATHS
Compliance with the Building Code  
can be demonstrated using various pathways. 
Understanding the New Zealand building control 
framework will help a building consent applicant 
decide which path is most suitable when 
designing and constructing building work.
The diagram below illustrates the hierarchy  
of New Zealand building controls, including  
the various compliance paths. 
The top three tiers of the pyramid (the Building 
Act and Building Regulations) show mandatory 
building legislation that must be followed, as 
explained in the previous section.
The rest of the diagram shows various paths 
that may be used to demonstrate compliance 
with the Building Code. Compliance with the 
Building Code must be demonstrated using one 
or more of the paths. The applicant can choose 
which path(s) to follow.
With the exception of alternative solutions, 
the paths illustrated on the previous page must 
be accepted by the building consent authority 
as meeting the performance requirements  
of the Building Code. These pathways are 
discussed below.
3.1	
Acceptable Solitions and Verification 	
	
	
Methods 
Acceptable Solutions and Verification Methods 
provide details for construction that, if followed, 
result in compliance with the Building Code. 
They are published by the Ministry of Business, 
Innovation and Employment. 
A design that complies with an Acceptable 
Solution or Verification Method must be 
accepted by a building consent authority as 
complying with the Building Code.
There is at least one Acceptable Solution or 
Verification Method for compliance with each of 
the Building Code clauses. 
For example, for Clause B1 of the Building Code 
there are two Verification Methods and three 
Acceptable Solutions. 
Acceptable Solutions  and Verification Methods 
are usually referred to by their Building Code 
clauses and unique identification numbers. 
Some examples are listed below.
•	 The Acceptable Solutions for Clause E2 
External Moisture are known as E2/AS1, 
E2/AS2 and E2/AS3.
•	 The Acceptable Solution for Clause G4 
Ventilation is known as G4/AS1.
•	 The Acceptable Solution for Clause G1 
Personal Hygiene is known as G1/AS1.
•	 The Verification Methods for Clause B1 
Structure are known as B1/VM1 and B1/VM4.
3.1.1	 Verification Methods
Verification Methods are tests or calculation 
methods that prescribe one way to comply  
with the Building Code. Verification Methods 
can include:
•	 calculation methods: using recognised 
analytical methods and mathematical models
•	 laboratory tests: using tests (sometimes to 
destruction) on prototype components and 
systems
•	 tests-in-situ: which may involve examination 
of plans and verification by test, where 
compliance with specified numbers, 
dimensions or locations is required (non-
destructive tests, such as pipe pressure 
tests, are also included).
3.1.2	Acceptable Solutions
These are simple step-by-step instructions  
that show one way to comply with the  
Building Code.
3.2 	 Product certification
The Building Act contains provisions for a 
voluntary product certification scheme  
that will enable product manufacturers  
to have their products certified as meeting 
nominated Performance requirements of the 
Building Code. 
Building products or methods that are used in 
accordance with a product certificate as provided 
by section 269 of the Building Act must be 
accepted as complying with the Building Code.

3.3	
Energy work certificate
Energy work is defined as gasfitting work or 
prescribed electrical work. An energy work 
certificate certifies that energy work complies 
with either the Electricity Act 1992 or the  
Gas Act 1992.
An energy work certificate must be accepted  
as establishing compliance with the relevant 
Performance requirements of the Building Code.
3.4	
New Zealand Standard NZS 4121
Section 119 of the Building Act specifies that 
NZS 4121, the code of practice for design for 
access and use of buildings by persons with 
disabilities (and any modification of that Standard), 
is to be taken as an Acceptable Solution. 
3.5	
Determinations
A determination is a binding decision made  
by the Department. It provides a way of solving 
disputes or answering questions relating to the 
Building Code and territorial authority/building 
consent authority/regional authority decisions 
under the Building Act. 
A range of matters can be determined, including:
• 	whether a building or building work complies 
with the Building Code
• 	a building consent authority’s decision  
on a building consent, a notice to fix,  
a code compliance certificate (CCC) or a 
compliance schedule 
• 	a territorial authority’s decision to issue  
a building consent subject to a waiver  
or modification 
• 	a territorial authority’s decision on a 
certificate of acceptance, a compliance 
schedule, a notice to fix, or a certificate  
for public use
• 	a regional authority’s or territorial authority’s 
exercise or failure to exercise its powers 
under the Building Act.
3.6	
Alternative solutions
An alternative solution is a building solution that 
differs, in part or wholly, from the solutions 
offered by the Acceptable Solution or 
Verification Method, but achieves compliance 
with the performance requirements of the 
Building Code to the satisfaction of the building 
consent authority.
There may be a number of reasons for the use 
of an alternative solution. 
•	 There may not be a Acceptable Solution or 
Verification Method for the proposed 
construction. 
 
•	 The building work may incorporate unusual 
design features that fall outside the scope  
of an Acceptable Solution or Verification 
Method. 
Whatever the reason for using an alternative 
solution, the Building Code, being performance-
based, allows for innovation and applicants have 
the freedom to propose an innovative solution. 
Refer to 2.3 ‘The New Zealand Building Code’.
3.7	
Producer statements 
A producer statement is a statement supplied 
by or on behalf of an applicant for a building 
consent, or by or on behalf of a person  
who has been granted a building consent.  
It is a statement that certain work will be,  
or has been, carried out in accordance with 
certain technical specifications.
Producer statements were introduced by  
the former Act and are no longer expressly 
referred to in the Building Act. A building 
consent authority may, at their discretion, 
accept and consider a producer statement as 
part of the plans or specifications for a building 
consent. This will assist the building consent 
authority in deciding whether it is satisfied  
on reasonable grounds the provisions of the 
Building Code will be met if the building work  
is completed in accordance with the plans and 
specifications. A building consent authority 
should have a formal procedure or policy in 
place for the use and consideration of producer 
statements, especially if a producer 
statement(s) will be required to prove building 
work complies with a building consent.

4.6 Licensed building practitioners
The Building Act set up a licensed building 
practitioners (LBP) scheme to promote, 
recognise and support professional skills  
and behaviour in the building industry. The 
scheme has seven licence classes covering 
designers, site supervisors and trades people, 
such as carpenters, roofers, plasterers and 
bricklayers.
To become licensed, building practitioners must 
show they meet the standard for the licence 
class appropriate for them. Details of LBPs  
are held on a public register at  
www.dbh.govt.nz/lbp-register
Once licensed, LBPs are responsible for 
notifying territorial authorities of breaches of 
building consents.
Since March 2012, restricted building work on 
houses and small-medium sized apartment 
buildings has only been able to be carried out  
or supervised by LBPs. Restricted building  
work is design and building work that is critical 
to the integrity of a house or small-medium 
sized apartment building. It covers aspects  
of the primary structure, external moisture 
management and fire design.
From March 2012:
•	 any plans and specifications containing 
restricted building work (relating to 
design work) must be accompanied by a 
memorandum issued by the LBP who carried 
out or supervised the design work, stating 
that the design work complies with the 
Building Code

•	 if an application for a building consent relates 
to restricted building work, the names of 
the LBPs carrying out or supervising that 
work must be given to the building consent 
authority in the application (if known) or 
once the work commences, or when 
the application for the code compliance 
certificate is made.

scheme is at www.dbh.govt.nz/lbp
4.7	
Past building control parties
4.7.1	 The Building Industry Authority
The Building Industry Authority (the Authority) 
was a Crown entity, established under the 
former Act as the sole regulatory authority  
for building controls in New Zealand. The 
introduction of the Building Act 2004 has seen 
the dissolution of the Authority and transfer of 
its responsibilities to the Department of Building 
and Housing (now the Ministry of Business, 
Innovation and Employment).
4.7.2	Building certifier
A building certifier was a person approved  
by the Authority under the former Act to issue 
building certificates with respect to specific 
provisions of the Building Code. A building 
certifier may have been employed by a building 
owner as an alternative to using the territorial 
authority for checking technical proposals and 
performing inspections. Building certifiers are 
not provided for under the Building Act except 
for certain transitional arrangements.
5.0	
BUILDING COMPLIANCE PROVISIONS
5.1	
Project information memoranda 	 	
	
	
(sections 31 to 39)
A project information memorandum (PIM) 
provides information known to the territorial 
authority/regional authority about land, and 
requirements of the Building Act and other  
Acts that might be relevant to proposed building 
work. A PIM is specific to the site and project.
A PIM is a legal document and may have  
a notice attached to it requiring the owner  
to obtain other approvals or consents required 
by other legislation, such as the Resource 
Management Act 1991, prior to any work 
commencing on the project. For example,  
a PIM might include the fact that the height  
of a building may contravene a rule in the 
District Plan, meaning that before work 
commences, a separate resource consent  
is required from the territorial authority  
planning unit.
An application for a building consent is deemed 
to include an application for a PIM, unless one 
has been previously issued for the project and 
this is supplied with the building consent 
application. In most cases, PIMs and building 
consents are applied for in a single application. 
They will be processed as separate applications, 
but may be issued separately or jointly.
If the application for a PIM affects a registered 
historic place, historic area, wahi tapu, or wahi 
tapu area, and a PIM has not been issued for 
the building work to which the application 
applies, then the territorial authority must notify 
the New Zealand Historic Places Trust within 
five days after receiving the application.
If the territorial authority considers a 
development contribution under the Local 
Government Act 2002 is payable by the owner, 
it may attach a notice (Form 3) that advises the 
applicant that a code compliance certificate will 
not be issued until the development 
contribution is paid.
5.2	
Building consents (sections 40 to 52)
A building consent is the formal approval, under 
section 49 of the Building Act, permitting an 
applicant to undertake building work in 
accordance with the plans and specifications 
approved by the building consent authority. 
Building work is the construction, alteration, 
demolition or removal of a building and includes 
sitework.
A person cannot carry out building work  
except in accordance with a building consent. 
There are some exemptions (see sections 41 
and 43 and Schedule 1 of the Building Act),  
but section 17 still requires building work to be 
carried out in accordance with the Building 
Code, even if no building consent is required.

5.2.1	Alterations (Section 112)
Where proposed building work involves an 
alteration to an existing building, the consent 
must not be granted unless the building 
consent authority is satisfied that all new 
building work complies with the Building Code 
and:
•	 the altered building will comply as nearly  
as is reasonably practicable with the Building 
Code provisions for means of escape from 
fire and access and facilities for people with 
disabilities, and
•	 the altered building will continue to comply 
with the other provisions of the Building 
Code to at least the same extent as before 
the alteration.
However, a territorial authority may allow the 
alteration of an existing building without 
complying with provisions of the Building Code 
specified by the territorial authority, if the 
territorial authority is satisfied that:
•	 if the building were required to comply with 
the relevant provisions of the Building Code, 
the alterations would not take place, and
•	 the alteration will result in improvements to 
attributes of the building that relate to means 
of escape from fire or access and facilities  
for persons with disabilities, and
•	 the improvements mentioned above 
outweigh any detriment that is likely to arise 
as a result of the building not complying with 
the relevant provisions of the Building Code.
5.2.2	Change of use (sections 114 and 115)
Uses of buildings are defined in Schedule 2  
of the Building (Specified Systems, Change  
the Use, and Earthquake-Prone Buildings) 
Regulations 2005.
A change of use arises when two criteria  
are met. The first criterion is that a building’s 
use must change from one use in Schedule 2  
to a different use in Schedule 2. The second 
criterion is the result of that change (first 
criterion) means the requirements for 
compliance with the Building Code for the  
new use are additional to, or more onerous 
than, the requirements for the old use.  
See Regulations 5 and 6 of the Building 
(Specified Systems, Change the Use, and 
Earthquake-Prone Buildings) Regulations 2005.
An owner of a building must give written notice 
to the territorial authority/regional authority if 
they propose to change the use of a building.
Where the owner proposes to change the use 
of a building to one or more household units, 
where household units did not exist before, 
they must obtain written notice from the 
territorial authority. This must state that the 
territorial authority is satisfied, on reasonable 
grounds, that the building, in its new use, will 
comply as nearly as is reasonably practicable, 
with the Building Code in all respects (usually 
through the issue of a building consent).
For any other change of use proposal, the 
owner must get written notice from the 
territorial authority/regional authority, stating 
that the authority is satisfied, on reasonable 
grounds, that the building, in its new use, will 
comply, as nearly as is reasonably practicable, 
with every provision of the Building Code that 
relates to either or both of the following 
matters:
•	 means of escape from fire, protection of 
other property, sanitary facilities, structural 
performance, and fire-rating performance
•	 access and facilities for people with 
disabilities (if this is a requirement under 
section 118 of the Building Act).
The territorial authority/regional authority must 
also be satisfied that the building will continue 
to comply with the other provisions of the 
Building Code to at least the same extent as 
before the change of use.
5.2.3	Extension of life (sections 114 and 116)
Where a building with a specified intended life 
is issued with a building consent that is subject 
to the condition that the building be altered 
before the end of its life, an ‘extension of life’ 
can be obtained. 
An owner of a building must give written notice 
to the territorial authority/regional authority if it 
proposes to extend the life of a building.

The territorial authority/regional authority can 
only give its consent to the extension of life  
if it is satisfied that:
•	 the building has been altered in accordance 
with the original condition
•	 the alteration complies with section 112  
of the Building Act (Alterations).
5.2.4	Subdivision (sections 114 and 116A)
An owner of a building must give written  
notice to the territorial authority if it proposes  
to subdivide land in a manner that affects a 
building.
The territorial authority can only issue a 
certificate under section 224(f) (relating to cross 
lease, company lease, and unit titles) of the 
Resource Management Act 1991 for the 
purpose of giving effect to a subdivision 
affecting a building or part of a building, if it is 
satisfied that the building will comply as nearly 
as reasonably practicable with every provision 
of the Building Code that relates to one or more 
of the following.
•	 Means of escape from fire
•	 Access and facilities for people with 
disabilities
•	 Protection of other property
The building must also continue to comply with 
other provisions of the Building Code to at least 
the same extent as it did before the application 
for subdivision was made. 
5.2.5	Access for persons with disabilities 	
	
	
(sections 117 to 120 and Schedule 2)
Any building (including parts of a building  
such as a driveway) that is open to the public, 
whether or not they are charged for entry,  
must have reasonable and adequate provision 
for access, parking and sanitary facilities for 
people with disabilities who may be expected 
to work or visit that building and carry out 
normal activities and processes in that building. 
The most recent version of NZS 4121 Code  
of Practice for Design for Access and Use  
of Buildings by Persons with Disabilities  
is to be taken as an Acceptable Solution.
5.3	
Code compliance certificate  
	
	
(sections 91 to 95)
A code compliance certificate (CCC) is a  
formal statement, issued under section 95  
of the Building Act, which states that building 
work carried out under a building consent 
application complies with that building consent. 
A CCC provides assurance to the owner and 
subsequent property owners that the approved 
plans and specifications have been followed.
A CCC is not issued until all building work  
has been completed as per the plans and 
specifications submitted with the building 
consent application.
A CCC must be applied for after all building 
work carried out under a building consent 
granted to the owner is completed.
An application for a CCC where the building 
work was carried out under a consent granted 
under the former Act must be considered and 
determined as if the Building Act had not been 
passed. However, section 43(2) of the former 
Act must be read as if a CCC may only be 
issued if the territorial authority is satisfied that 
the building work complies with the Building 
Code that applied at the time the building 
consent was granted.
5.4	
Certificates of acceptance  
	
	
(sections 96 to 99)
Certificates of acceptance were introduced  
by the Building Act. The certificate confirms 
that, to the extent an inspection was able to  
be carried out, the building work complies with 
the Building Code. A certificate of acceptance 
therefore has some similarities to a CCC in  
that it will provide some verification for a 
building owner, or future building owner,  
that all or part of the work is compliant.

Preface
15
A certificate of acceptance can be obtained  
in situations where:
•	 work has been done without a building 
consent when one should have been 
obtained
•	 a building consent authority or building 
certifier is unable or refuses to issue a CCC
•	 verification is required of urgent building 
work carried out under section 42 of the 
Building Act.
A certificate of acceptance can also be  
used in limited circumstances in relation  
to section 363B.
A certificate of acceptance is based on 
verification with the Building Code that was in 
place at the time of application. It is not based 
on what was in place at the time a building 
consent was granted, or should have been 
applied for, or when the work was actually 
carried out. 
5.5 	 Notices to fix  
	
	
(sections 163 to 168)
A notice to fix is a statutory notice requiring  
a person to remedy a breach of the Building Act 
or Regulations under the Act. A notice to fix can 
be issued for all breaches of the Building Act, 
including non-complying building work, and  
for an incorrect building warrant of fitness  
or a compliance schedule that is not being 
properly complied with. A notice to fix can state 
that all or any building work must cease 
immediately.
A building consent authority, regional authority 
or a territorial authority must issue a notice to 
fix for any contravention of the Building Act and 
Building Regulations under section 164 of the 
Building Act. When a notice to fix has been 
issued by a building consent authority that is 
not a territorial authority or a regional authority, 
the matter is then handed to the territorial 
authority or regional authority to decide 
whether the notice has been complied with.
Some examples of where notices could be 
issued include: 
•	 carrying out building work other than  
in accordance with a building consent
•	 displaying an incorrect building warrant  
of fitness
•	 changing the use of a building without 
notifying the territorial authority or regional 
authority.
5.6	
Compliance schedules  
	
	
(sections 100 to 107)
A compliance schedule lists specified systems 
within a building. The compliance schedule  
for a building must identify which specified 
systems are present, the performance 
standards for those systems, and how those 
systems will be inspected and maintained to 
ensure they continue to function.
For more information on compliance schedules, 
see the Compliance Schedule Handbook. 
5.7	
Building warrants of fitness  
	
	
(sections 108 to 111)
A building warrant of fitness (BWoF)  
is a statement supplied by a building owner,  
to the territorial authority confirming that the 
systems specified in the compliance schedule 
for their building have been maintained and 
checked in accordance with the compliance 
schedule for the previous 12 months, and will 
continue to perform as required. For more 
information on building warrants of fitness,  
see the Compliance Schedule Handbook.

5.8	
Certificates for public use  
	
	
(section 363A)
A certificate for public use is a safety provision 
under the Building Act. It is a tool that can  
be used to certify that premises or parts of 
premises affected by building work are safe to 
be used by the public. Certificates for public 
use can only be used where a building consent 
has been granted for the building work but no 
CCC has yet been issued. Certificates for public 
use do not relieve the owner of a building from 
the obligation to apply for a CCC after all the 
building work has been carried out.
5.9	
Building certificate
A building certificate was a formal confirmation 
by a building certifier that specific aspects of a 
building would or do comply with the Building 
Code. A territorial authority was obliged to 
accept such a certificate. Building certificates 
were allowed for under the former Act, but are 
only included under the Building Act 2004 as 
transitional allowances to phase them out.

CLAUSE A1—CLASSIFIED USES 
1.0 EXPLANATION 
1.0.1 For the purposes of this building code buildings are classified according to type, 
under seven categories. 
1.0.2 A building with a given classified use may have one or more intended uses  
as defined in the Act. 
2.0 HOUSING 
2.0.1 Applies to buildings or use where there is self care and service (internal 
management). There are three types: 
2.0.2 Detached Dwellings 
Applies to a building or use where a group of people live as a single household  
or family. Examples: a holiday cottage, boarding house accommodating fewer than  
6 people, dwelling or hut. 
2.0.3 Multi-unit Dwelling 
Applies to a building or use which contains more than one separate household  
or family. Examples: an attached dwelling, flat or multi-unit apartment. 
2.0.4 Group Dwelling 
Applies to a building or use where groups of people live as one large extended family. 
Examples: within a commune or marae. 
3.0 COMMUNAL RESIDENTIAL 
3.0.1 Applies to buildings or use where assistance or care is extended to the principal 
users. There are two types: 
3.0.2 Community Service 
Applies to a residential building or use where limited assistance or care is extended  
to the principal users. Examples: a boarding house, hall of residence, holiday cabin, 
[backcountry hut,] hostel, hotel, motel, nurses’ home, retirement village, time-share 
accommodation, a work camp, or camping ground. 
3.0.3 Community Care 
Applies to a residential building or use where a large degree of assistance or care  
is extended to the principal users. There are two types: 
(a)	 Unrestrained; where the principal users are free to come and go.  
Examples: a hospital, an old people’s home or a health camp. 
(b)	Restrained; where the principal users are legally or physically constrained  
in their movements. Examples: a borstal or drug rehabilitation centre, an old people’s 
home where substantial care is extended, a prison or hospital. 
4.0 COMMUNAL NON-RESIDENTIAL 
4.0.1 Applies to a building or use being a meeting place for people where care and 
service is provided by people other than the principal users. There are two types: 
4.0.2 Assembly Service 
Applies to a building or use where limited care and service is provided.  
Examples: a church, cinema, clubroom, hall, museum, public swimming pool,  
stadium, theatre, or whare runanga (the assembly house). 
Schedule 1 clause A1 3.0.2: amended, on 31 October 2008, by regulation 4 of the Building (Building Code: Backcountry Huts) Amendment  
Regulations 2008 (SR 2008/358).

Importance 
level 1
Buildings posing low risk to human 
life or the environment, or a low 
economic cost, should the building 
fail. These are typically small non- 
habitable buildings, such as sheds, 
barns, and the like, that are not 
normally occupied, though they may 
have occupants from time to time.
•	 Ancillary buildings not for 
human habitation
•	 Minor storage facilities
•	 Backcountry huts

Notional boundary The boundary which for fire safety purposes, is assumed to 	AS/VM C 
exist between two buildings on the same property under a single land title.
COMMENT:
A notional boundary may be located anywhere between the two buildings on the same  
property using the following rules:   
1. The notional boundary is assumed to exist in the space between the buildings and is  
positioned so that one of the buildings would comply with the provisions for space  
separation having regard to the amount of its unprotected area. In practice, if one of the  
buildings is existing, the position of the boundary will be set by the space separation  
factors for that building.

4. 	A wall along a boundary between two allotments is called a “party wall” when the owners  
of the allotments each have legal rights in respect of that wall registered by way of  
easements on one or both titles. An internal wall between cross-leases, company leases,  
or unit titles, or between one of them and common property, is not generally called a party  
wall but in that case also the lessees, unit title holders, or corporate body concerned each  
have legal rights in respect of that wall. Such a wall separates areas which are other  
property in relation to each other, but the wall itself is part of each property. The fire  
protection consequence of that legal concept is that such a wall can be regarded as a fire  
separation providing protection against horizontal fire spread in each direction. In other  
words, that wall may provide the appropriate FRR instead of each property having its own  
wall of that FRR.

Weathertightness and weathertight Terms used to describe the resistance 	
AS/VM E2 
of a building to the weather. Weathertightness is a state where water  
is prevented from entering and accumulating behind the cladding in amounts  
that can cause undue dampness or damage to the building elements.
COMMENT:
The term weathertightness is not necessarily the same as waterproof. However, 	
 
a weathertight building, even under severe weather conditions, is expected to limit moisture  
ingress to inconsequential amounts, insufficient to cause undue dampness inside buildings 
 and damage to building elements. Moisture that may occasionally enter is able to harmlessly  
escape or evaporate.
Weathertightness and weathertight Terms used to describe the resistance 	
Simple House 
of a building to the weather.
Wet area An area within a building supplied with water from a water supply 	
Simple House 
system including bathrooms and showers, laundries, sanitary compartments  
and kitchen areas.	
Wetwall The exterior cladding on a wall with a drained cavity.	
AS/VM E2
Wharenui A communal meeting house having a large open floor area used 	
AS/VM C, H1 
for both assembly and sleeping in the traditional Maori manner.	
Wind zone Categorisation of wind force experienced on a particular site 	
AS/VM E2 
as determined in NZS 3604, Section 5.
COMMENT:
Maximum ultimate limit state speeds are:
Low wind zone = wind speed of 32 m/s
Medium wind zone = wind speed of 37 m/s
High wind zone = wind speed of 44 m/s
Very high wind zone = wind speed of 50 m/s
Extra high wind zone = wind speed of 55 m/s.
Specific design is required for wind speeds greater than 55 m/s.
Wire dog Galvanised or stainless steel wire, D or Z shaped nail, spiked at 	
Simple House 
each end. Used for fixing timber together to resist uplift
Working day means any day except—	
BA04
(a)	Saturday, Sunday, Good Friday, Easter Monday, Anzac Day, the Sovereign’s  
Birthday, Labour Day, and Waitangi Day; and
(b)	the day observed in the appropriate area as the anniversary of the province  
of which the area forms a part; and
(c)	a day in the period beginning on 20 December in any year and ending with  
the close of 10 January in the following year.
Yield Mass of a combustion product generated during combustion divided 	
AS/VM C 
by the mass loss of the test specimen.
