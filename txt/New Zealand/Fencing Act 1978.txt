party may thereupon, or at any time within 90 days thereafter, proceed to do the

If the party who last proceeded to do the work fails for a period of 28 days to
carry out the work with due diligence, the other party may proceed to complete

notices, cross-notices, agreements, and orders relating to the work (other than

notice shall cease to have effect.
16
Contribution where immediate work required

Person taking advantage of fence
(1)
In any case where there is a fence along the boundary between any land and a
road, if a person (other than the owner or occupier or some other person law‐
fully in possession of that land) adopts or takes advantage of any means by
which the fence is rendered of beneficial use to himself, or avails himself of the
fence, the occupier of that land may serve on that other person a notice in writ‐
ing requiring him to pay interest at the rate of 10% per annum on half the value
of the fence at the time of the serving of the notice; and, so long as that other
person continues to take advantage or avail himself of the fence, he shall be
liable to pay that interest to the giver of the notice or his successor in title, and
he shall also be liable for repairs to the fence as if he were an adjoining occu‐
pier.
(2)
In any case where a notice in respect of a fence has been served under subsec‐
tion (1) and the value of the fence subsequently increases, a further notice in
respect of the fence may be served under that subsection and the provisions of
that subsection shall apply accordingly in respect of that further notice.

side thereof had, by reason of section 3 or of the Fencing Act 1908 or any cor‐
responding former Act, no liability to contribute to the cost of the erection, if
the occupier for the time being of that land has thereafter become liable to con‐
tribute to the cost of work on that fence—
(a)
the person who erected the fence, or his successor in title, may serve
upon the occupier of that land a notice in writing requiring him to pay an
appropriate share of the value of the fence at the time when the notice is
served taking into account any contributions made towards the cost of
the erection and maintenance of that fence by any occupier of that land;
and
(b)
that occupier shall, within 1 month after receiving the notice, pay that
share to the person who erected the fence, or to his successor in title, and

Crown tenant’s option
Where a fence was erected under the provisions of the Fencing Act 1908 divid‐

on him by section 20 of the Fencing Act 1908 to pay to the person who erected
the fence, or to his successor in title, interest on the proportionate share of the
cost of erecting the fence for which he may have been liable as an occupier
instead of paying that proportionate share, that Crown tenant shall continue to
be liable to pay to that other person (or his successor in title) interest on that
share at that rate during his term of occupation of the Crown land.
Compare: 1908 No 61 s 20

manner hereafter provided in this section.
(2)
The court may inspect, or may appoint 1 or more persons to inspect, the pro‐
posed line of fence, and shall determine whether a fence is necessary, and (if
so) what line is to be adopted; and whether any, and (if so) what compensation
(whether an annual payment or otherwise) is to be made to either of the occupi‐
ers in consideration of loss of occupation of land.
(3)
The reasonable costs of inspection shall be borne as the court in its discretion
shall direct.
(4)
